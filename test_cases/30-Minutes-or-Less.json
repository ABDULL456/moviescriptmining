{"train": "30 MINUTES OR LESS \nWritten by \nMichael Diliberti & Matthew Sullivan \nThe following is very loosely based on some shit that actually happened... OVER BLACK \nWe hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some throaty, fucked up muffler, as \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nAn '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway. It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the \nEXT. SUBURBS - DAY \nThe car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through the intersection. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING \nWe don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip- ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel cranks right as the car turns onto a - \nOne way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and - \nGarbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing the trash aside. The car whips another turn and \nEXT. SUBURBS - DAY \nThe Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away. \nCUT TO: \nTIRES SCREECH \nBrake pads smoke. The Mustang stops outside \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nThe Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front door, we see the urgent package he is delivering. \nTWO LARGE PIZZAS \nBefore he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15- YEAR-OLDS stare out. \n15-YEAR-OLD That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes late. Pizza's free. \nREVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25), probably good looking in another life. \nRight now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red \"Giorgio's Trattoria\" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt. \nWILL Gimme a break. You guys live two towns away. It's pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes. \nOTHER 15-YEAR-OLD Exactly. That's why we ordered from your shitty \"trattoria.\" \nWILL This is gonna come out of my paycheck. You sure you don't want to take the moral high ground? \nOTHER 15-YEAR-OLD We'd rather take the pizzas. \nWill takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas. \nWILL Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You figured out a way to beat the system. (PEEKS INSIDE) Got the house to yourselves? \n15-YEAR-OLD That's right. \nWILL Not bad. Any jailbait in there? Little pizza and a rainbow party? \nThe kids shakes their heads. \nWILL Seriously? Well, two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit, right? Just call the girls up and let them know the party's on. \n15-YEAR-OLD Man, we don't have any of that stuff. \nWill makes a show of mulling this over. \nWILL I really shouldn't do this...but you seem like a couple of good dudes. I'll tell you what, you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers. (MORE) \nWILL (CONT'D) (BEAT) But I get to keep the change as a tip. Deal? \nThe kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some cash. Will snatches it and heads off. \nWill grudgingly stands up. \nWILL I guess that's just the difference between you and me. \nHe holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs. \nWILL I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets. No rules, no attachments. Every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge. You're fucking Murtaugh. Always worried about your pension. Well, guess what, it gets old after the first movie. \nCHET I just got head. I'm totally Riggs. Will shakes his head, turns and walks off. INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn. Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover - It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young. Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will and the girl look very high and very happy. Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM. WILL Fuck. INT. MUSTANG - DAY Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his \"Giorgio's\" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear-view mirror. \nWILL You asshole. You titanic asshole. Come on down and get your prize. \nHe makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls the trigger and \nBOOM! \nWE'RE IN \nEXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY \nA watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud, dumb laughter echoes. \nStanding 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird. \nDWAYNE Fruit motherfuckin' salad! \nCrouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar eagerness to please in them. \nJAY This one's gonna blow even bigger. \nDWAYNE Boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something. \nJAY Whatever. I don't need the military. I taught myself how to do this shit. \nDWAYNE I hear that. I taught myself how to eat pussy. And cut my own hair. \nJay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it. \nDWAYNE This one's all me. (makes \"radio\" sounds) Mr. President, we have enemies at the gate. Give me the order. (more \"radio\" sounds) Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate with terrorists! \nDwayne presses a button and \nBOOM! \nThe explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice. \nINT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY \nLarge and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more. \nDWAYNE Wanna make sure I get enough calories. \nJAY I thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer. Bang that towel girl at the community pool. \nDWAYNE It's obvious you don't know shit-all about physical fitness. You gotta bulk up first, then you slim down. I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago. If you'd listened to me, maybe you'd know what the fuck I'm talking about. (BEAT) Grab some RC Cola. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY \nThe shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder! \nThe guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They both wear cheap cardboard glasses. \nJay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax. \nJAY Shit, man! It's so real! \nDwayne reaches out, \"touching\" the 3D images. He stands and starts humping the air. \nDWAYNE Check it out. I ain't afraid of Jason. I'm fucking him. (THRUSTING HARDER) You like that, Jason!? In the mask! \nJay cracks up. The lights flick on. \nGRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.) Who are you two fags fucking? \nStanding by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most people just call him \"THE MAJOR.\" The faded USMC tattoo on his thick forearm explains why. \nJAY Afternoon, Major. \nDwayne flops back onto the couch. \nRows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat. \nWILL Rio? \nKATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the girl from the picture in Will's apartment. \nKATE That's the plan. Five days, six nights. Culture. Beaches. Acceptable probability of kidnapping. I leave in the morning. \nKate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer from the \"proceed\" key...closes the window. \nKATE This morning I loaded up an African Safari and a cruise to Alaska. \nWILL Oh, the places you'll go. \nKATE Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making it seem so easy. \nWILL It is. Just do it. Get away for a while. \nKATE Even if I could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. Now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days. \nWILL Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the actual working world. Can we eat? \nWill lays a pizza down on her desk. \nKATE How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard? \nWILL He's there like half the time. The other half I smile at him. I'm relatively certain he's a homosexual. \nKATE Interesting theory... \nKate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice. \nKATE Maybe I should set him up with Tom Small. He came out to me today on Facebook. \nWILL That kid beat the hell out of me and Chet in grammar school. Wow. \nKATE Tell me about it. He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing \"No Scrubs.\" \nWILL (WINCES) Really? What a fucking scrub. \nWill grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat. \nKATE So, I've got some news... \nWILL I thought the Tom Small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead. \nKATE I'm getting back together with Mark. \nWill's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. He does his best to swallow it down. \nWILL But you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship. Finality was had. \nKATE Yeah, but we were talking and - \nWILL Forget it. I don't want to know. \nKATE You sound like Chet. \nWILL Woah, don't compare me to your brother. \nKATE Well, neither one of you seems to care that I don't have a life. Mark's not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every Friday because I have nowhere else to be. \nWILL Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday night. Nowhere to be. \nKate shoves Will, good-naturedly. \nKATE You know what I mean. \nWill shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza. \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \nMost of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring from a large flat-screen TV. \nAt a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation. \nJAY I don't wanna stick my nose into a family matter...but killing your old man? That's pretty messed up...I mean, unless you think it isn't. \nDWAYNE What we have here is a classic \"lesser of two evils\" debate. You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major's shitty life. Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser. \nJAY Except The Major. \nDWAYNE Yeah. The Major dies. But no one gets hurt. \nDwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him - \nDWAYNE There's just one problem. Where do we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started...doing shit that's gonna get us caught. (MIND WORKING) What we need is someone to come to us...to a place where we can control the situation. Someone without any connection to us. \nThe guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on the flat-screen. A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box - \nPIZZA CHEF (ON TV) We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less! Or your pizza is free! Giorgio's Trattoria, where the customer gets what they want...pronto! \nThe guys look at each other. \nDWAYNE Sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it. \nINT. CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA hand grabs a beer from the fridge. \nVOICE (O.S.) You're not trying to draw a psycho pension...you really are crazy! \nWill heads into the living room with the beer. The voice belongs to Danny Glover. The guys are watching Lethal Weapon. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson) from killing himself. Riggs looks at him, crazily, before - \nRIGGS (ON TV) I'm hungry. I'm gonna get something to eat. \nChet looks over at Will. He is drunk, and in a dark mood. \nCHET Maybe you should pace yourself. It's noon on a Saturday. \nWILL Fridge is full, man. We're all good. \nWill drains half his beer. \nWILL Let me ask you a question. You remember Tom Small? \nCHET Yeah, he used to kick our asses. \nWILL Turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards. He's gay. \nCHET I hope he chokes on a dick. I never liked him. \nWILL Your sister did. She let him finger blast her. Big time. \nChet pauses the movie. \nCHET What the fuck are you talking about? I don't want that shit in my head. \nWILL Sorry. Kate told me about it last night. I thought you should know. \nCHET You two were swapping stories about getting fingered? That's pretty cute. \nChet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer. \nWILL The point I'm trying to make is this: Tom Small was an asshole. He was totally wrong for your sister. Just like every other guy she's ever dated. Right through to that Mark dude she's gonna get back together with. Un-be- fuck-me-lievable... \nCHET Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with? \nAt a loss, Will shrugs. Chet turns back to the TV, presses play. Lethal Weapon resumes. Something blows up. Chet pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat. \nCHET You sneaky son of a bitch...you want to fuck my sister, don't you? \nWILL Chet, I really don't... \nCHET My twin sister!? Which is basically like fucking me! \nWILL Hey, if you guys had that twin ESP shit this would be a completely different situation. There'd be logistical problems. \nCHET We look exactly alike! \nWILL You look like a lot of people. You're a normal looking dude. \nCHET This is so fucked up I can't even begin to process it. How long has this been going on? \nWILL If I had to put my finger on it...middle school-ish. \nCHET So all those sleepovers, they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in Kate's bedroom? \nWILL It might have happened a few times. Most of them were accidental. \nWill storms out. \nEXT. CHET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nWill screeches away in his car. \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh and joke around. Best buds. \nWill looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them to sop it up. \nINT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT \nWill sits at a table, looking out through the misty window. \nChristopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him. \nCHRISTOPHER Come on, wake up and get to work. \nChristopher hands him the order slip. Will checks the address. \nWILL Where the fuck is this? \nCHRISTOPHER How should I know? It's 30 minutes away or the pizza comes out of your paycheck. Tick tock. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nWill's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway. The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into the distance. \nEXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the sky, beacon light flashing atop it. \nWill checks the address, then drives through the open gate. \nEXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT \nThe Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out. \nThere is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top of a small office structure. \nThe office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside. \nWILL Hello? \nDWAYNE (O.S.) (calling back from beyond door) Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The county's got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night! \nThis puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne \nWEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK \nWILL What the - \nWill hears something behind him and whirls around - \nTo find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him. \nWILL Holy fuck! \nWill makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car. \nDWAYNE Stop! We got a gun, you asshole! \nWill breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery. \nDWAYNE Fuck! Get him! \nJay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him. \nWill is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body. \nWILL What the hell!? (at a loss) Rape! \nJay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose. Will soon goes limp. \nDwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles. \nDWAYNE Step one. \nDWAYNE (CONT'D) You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year. \nDwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest. \nDWAYNE It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours. \nHe hands Will a slip of paper. \nDWAYNE Once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it. You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want. (BEAT) Now let me demonstrate what happens if you don't get us the money. \nDwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. Dwayne mimes answering a phone - \nDWAYNE Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that? You don't have the money? It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? Well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up. \nJay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes. All that remains is a cloud of stuffing. \nWill is frozen in fear. \nDWAYNE I liked that bear. I don't even know you. \nDwayne throws Will his car keys. \nDWAYNE Go on. Get outta here. \nWILL Guys, can we please just talk about this? \nDWAYNE Yeah, of course we can. \nDwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet. Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side. \nDWAYNE Be careful! \nWill awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the engine and backs away - \nDWAYNE That's right! Get the fuck out of here! You're wasting time! \nOnce the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne stays primate. \nJAY What the hell, Dwayne? You told me that was a replica gun. \nDWAYNE It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. Now it goes boom. \nJAY We didn't discuss a loaded gun! Especially not with the bomb around! \nDwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion. \nDWAYNE Don't you ever question me. I'm fucking this bitch. You're just holding the camera. \nJAY (VOICE FALTERS) Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say. \nDWAYNE Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines. This is cash money. You hesitate, you fuck up...and I will leave you behind. \nA tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm. \nDWAYNE Let's go get some breakfast. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nWill's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop, tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and pukes. He drops to his knees. \nWILL Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me! Someone please fucking help me! \nNothing but the wind. \nWill fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth. He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts. He pauses on Chet's name...presses send. \nThe line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer: 7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car. \nINT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nA laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map. \nChet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates with his laser pointer - \nCHET This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase. \nSEVENTH GRADER (COUGHING) Nice laser. \nThe class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer. \nChet takes a step toward Will. \nCHET Are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second? \nWill just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance. After a beat - \nCHET Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while? \nWILL I can do that. \nWill opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet. \nWILL Thank you. \nWill heads out. Chet takes a breath, bracing himself. \nINT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWill walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him. \nCHET Yes, I'm still here. I really am this stupid. Just pay attention to where you're going. \nWILL I think I can handle it. \nCHET These floors get waxed once a week. On Tuesday, which today is. You hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and I got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out. \nWILL Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as it is. Please. I don't need you back seat driving me right now. \nCHET Obviously. \nWill stops, turns back toward Chet. \nWILL Just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. And there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway. If I fall, and if this thing goes off, I'm probably not taking out the whole school. \nCHET Do you really want to debate this? \nWill sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes. \nWill freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats bullets, gives Will a look of death. \nAfter a beat, the hallway empties again. \nCHET You're an asshole. \nWILL Whatever. It's over. \nWill continues walking. He tries to lighten the mood - \nWILL Who was the chick in the white jeans? \nCHET Kristi Evans. Why? \nWILL You know why. \nCHET Oh, come on. Just keep walking. \nThe guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway... \nWILL Come on yourself. You knew exactly who I was talking about. \nCHET Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade. \nWILL I bet you love it when she calls you Mr. Chet. \nCHET She doesn't call me \"Mr. Chet.\" She's not a foreigner. \nEXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nThe guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell - \nCHET ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll call you after I talk to the doctor. \nChet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He looks over the roof of the car at Will. \nCHET So, this is it? \nWILL This is what? \nCHET Once I step inside this car, I'm basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. And if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. They'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. It'll be all over the news. Next thing you now, some militia or Islam group is claiming us as members. My family will be humiliated. \nThe door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest. The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it. \nWill is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off...no luck. \nWILL It's too tight! \nHe is calling off toward the \nKITCHEN \nWhere Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom. He uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb. \nCHET What if we try to separate your shoulder? \nWILL (O.S.) Fuck you! \nCHET Well, all these sites say different shit. There's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community. \nWill emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on. \nWILL This is pointless. \nChet shuts his laptop. \nCHET I agree. We gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something. \nWILL We can't. These guys said they'd be following me. And I don't have a clue what they look like. For all I know, they're outside right now. They see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses. \nWill stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed. \nWILL What do I do, man? What do I do now? \nCHET I don't know, Will...I guess you gotta rob the bank. \nWILL I haven't been inside a bank in three years! How the fuck am I supposed to rob one!? They wouldn't even give me a savings account! \nWill drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands, fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance - \nCHET It's gonna be okay. \nWILL No, it's not! I'm gonna blow up! That's way worse than getting stabbed or shot. At least some people survive that. No one survives being blown up. (MORE) \nWILL (CONT'D) No one is ever like, \"Yeah, I heard Steve got blown up, tough break, but how's he doing now? Is he still in the Rec basketball league?\" No of course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing left of Steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops! \nChet looks on as his friend begins to sob. It's a crushing sight. Chet strides across the apartment - \nCHET Pull yourself together! \n- and attempts to give him one of those \"get a grip\" slaps. But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear. \nWILL Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my eardrum. \nCHET Sorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do that. But just listen to me now. You're not gonna die. You wanna know why? Because you know exactly how to rob a bank. \nWILL What are you talking about? \nCHET Point Break. \nWILL The movie? \nCHET Yes. That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies. You just bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast. Stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault. \nWILL Yeah...I guess it's pretty simple, right? And it's just a local bank. The Donner-Wells on Charles Road. \nCHET Really? I applied for a job there like a year ago. \nWILL You wanted to be a teller? \nCHET Yeah, so what? It's a good job. You get benefits. \nWILL Like what, a name tag? \nCHET What kind of benefits do you get? Free toppings? \nWILL That's really clever. No one ever said that shit to me before. Anyway, this is perfect. You know the whole layout of the bank. \nCHET Not exactly. They didn't hand me the security schematics with the application. But I sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. I know what the place looks like. \nWILL How many guards? \nCHET Mr. Fisher is coming! \nAs he looks for an escape - \nCHET Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there? \nWILL No! \nWill hops out of the car. He rifles through the Walmart bag. \nCHET What are you doing? \nWill pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of the freshly painted air pistols. \nWILL I'm doing what I have to. \nWill puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down his mask. It's backwards. \nWill levels the pistol - \nMR. FISHER Oh, Jesus! \nMr. Fisher braces himself against a wall. Chet fumbles to turn his mask around. Will affects a deep voice - \nWILL Where are the car keys? \nMR. FISHER They're in my pocket! I'm just reaching in my pocket for the keys! \nWILL Quiet down and do it already. \nMr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys. They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand. Will snatches them. \nWILL Now listen, I don't want you to report this car stolen or anything until later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock. 6 to be safe. \nMR. FISHER Sure. Anything you say. \nWill seems unconvinced. He looks to Chet, who shrugs. Will turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun - \nWILL If you fuck with us, I swear, I will...I will shoot your son. Taylor. I know where he works. At the fucking travel agency. He's the douchebag with the bangs. \nMR. FISHER (STUNNED) Please no. I won't do anything. I won't. Just leave Taylor alone. \nWILL I'm gonna trust you. But if you call the police, there's gonna be an undertaker styling his stupid fucking bangs! (BEAT) Now open the garage door. \nMr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door. Chet grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side. Will backs toward the driver side. \nWILL The car's insured, right? \nMr. Fisher nods. \nWILL Okay. I feel better. Worse comes to worst, something happens to it, you can get a Honda. This thing doesn't even have airbags. \nMR. FISHER Please, just go. \nWill slides into the car and starts it up. \nEXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY \nThe car peels away. \nINT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING \nThe guys yank off their ski masks. \nCHET That old man's got a heart condition! You could have killed him! \nWILL My hand was forced! \nChet tries to get comfortable in the seat. \nCHET Awesome. I'm stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb. \nWill works the manual transmission. He steps on the gas. \nWILL This thing's got some pickup. \nCHET Could you just take it easy, we're doing fine on time. \nWILL I know...but there's one last stop we have to make. \nWill waves at her from where he is standing, way across on the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him. \nWILL Stop! \nWill takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate's phone rings. She answers it, confused. \nKATE What are you doing? \nWe STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring. \nWILL Just don't come any closer. \nKATE Why not? What's going on? \nWILL I'm gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation, so please be cool. (BEAT) Some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime. \nKATE Will, I swear, if this is - \nWILL I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I know it's a lot to swallow, but you gotta take it on face value, because there's a timer attached to this thing and it's counting down. \nKate's voice falters - \nKATE Oh my god, Will...we'll get help. I'll get you help. \nWILL I didn't come here for help. I'm taking care of it. I came here because, should things not work out today as I would like them to, I want you to know why I was doing the things I did. \nKATE Please, just let me call someone. Let me do something. This is crazy! \nWILL I don't disagree with you. It's fucking nuts. But that's not even what this is about. (STRUGGLING) Do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you, me and Chet, with Chet cut out of it? \nKATE Will, I can't remember about some stupid picture while you're - \nWILL I need you to remember about the picture, and about how I stop by your office every Friday, and how I've always hated all your boyfriends, and how the two girls I've ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you. (BEAT) Do you see where I'm going with this? I love you Kate. I have for a very long time. \nKate is barely holding it together. \nKATE Will, this is a lot you're putting on me! You just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me. What the fuck is going on? \nWILL A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do this to you, but I was afraid I'd never get the chance to tell you. And I know you have feelings for me, too. Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother. (MORE) \nWILL (CONT'D) But what I hope is that you don't really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you'll realize it's the same way I feel for you. Does that make any sense? \nKATE Yes. I mean, I've known you forever. It's not an easy thing to figure out. \nWILL I don't need an answer now. Just think about it. And no matter what you decide, you're too good for assholes like Mark and the rest of them. \nKate manages a small, stifled laugh. \nKATE Okay. I will process all of this. It's just, the bomb - \nWILL It's distracting. I know. Anyway, I'd love to stay and talk some more, but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave now, because I'm running out of time. \nKate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will - \nKATE If I had time to think about it...I'd probably tell you that I've always felt very strongly for you. And I've never thought of you as a brother. \nWill smiles, yells back - \nWILL That's a huge relief. Don't say anything else. I just really don't want to die now. \nKATE Try not to. Please. \nKate turns and continues to the access door. \nINT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nJay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof. He hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for the nearest floor. He tries the door, but it's locked. \nKate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots Jay trying to force the door open. She is holding back tears. He just looks incredibly confused. \nJAY I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper. I'm looking for Mr. Quilby. \nKATE I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. \nKate continues down the stairs, tears coming now. Jay waits a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next level, which is open. \nINT. MINIVAN - DAY \nJay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing. \nSECURITY GUARD Just take it easy, man! \nWILL Don't be a hero, cowboy! \nSECURITY GUARD What the fuck does that mean? I'm not a hero! Or a cowboy! \nAs people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one ANOTHER - \nChet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass partition. \nCHET All of you, back away from the counter and get out here! Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot! \nThe Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs. \nWill looks to the Guard. \nWILL Very slowly, take out your gun and toss it away. \nThe Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and - \nRight into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s), whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform. \nMOM Oh, god! I don't want the gun! \nWILL (TO GUARD) What the fuck!? Did you do that on purpose!? \nSECURITY GUARD It was an accident! \nCHET Are you guys working together? \nMOM No! Please take this gun away! \nWILL Just toss it, lady! \nThe Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and \nBLAM! \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Ah! \nA FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh. \nFAT MAN I think she got the femoral artery! \nMOM I'm sorry! It was an accident! \nFAT MAN Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!? \nDAUGHTER Mommy, what's happening!? \nMOM Christi, be quiet. These men are dangerous. \nChet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently - \nCHET This is fucked. That dude is gonna bleed out and we're gonna go to prison. \nWILL Just calm down. \nFAT MAN Why is no one getting me help!? \nWILL Is anyone here a doctor? \nNothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people. \nWill hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging his leg. \nWILL Sir, let me see where you're hit. \nFAT MAN Just call me an ambulance! \nWILL Calm down, sir. \nThe Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of blood. \nWILL It's just a flesh wound. You're gonna be okay. \nFAT MAN But it hurts so bad. \nWILL You got shot, man. It's not supposed to feel good. But you're gonna be fine. And you'll have a great story to tell everyone. \nZurman doesn't stick around for the rest. He turns and sprints away. \nAs the guys make for the Datsun - CHET That was awesome. WILL He was tempting a desperate motherfucker. The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police cruisers race toward the bank. The cruisers change course and give chase. The Datsun blows right by the parked INT. MINIVAN - DAY Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance. DWAYNE Holy shit! Our boy is causing some serious mayhem! JAY He's gonna get caught or killed. Dwayne whirls on Jay, punches him hard in the shoulder. DWAYNE Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this with your negativity, I'm gonna strap a bomb to your chest next. Jay massages his shoulder, pissed. \nJAY Oh, yeah, who's gonna build it? \nDWAYNE You are! \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nWhiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other. Airborne leaves flutter in their wake. \nINT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING \nChet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic. Will weaves in and out of cars. \nCHET Shit! This is not cool! \nWill is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet's head is on a swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death. \nCHET Maybe we should pull over and surrender. \nWILL I can outrun these guys. They're not the FBI, they're local cops. Just shut up and let me concentrate. I do this for a living. \nAs they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia - \nCHET You don't do anything like this for a living! I am not a pizza, I am a man! \nThe cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open. \nWill downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks a hard right and \nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nThe Datsun explodes onto a crowded street. PEDESTRIANS crossing an intersection jump out of its way. \nThe cruisers take the turn into town. One makes it. The other slams into parked cars. \nINT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING \nWill jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged. \nWILL Holy fuck! \nWill veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him. \nHe finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering Pedestrians. \nChet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them. \nCHET Go! Go! Go! \nWill steps on the gas. The light ahead turns red. \nCHET Stop! Stop! Stop! \nWill rolls the dice and blows through the intersection. He's lucky. The cruiser behind him is not. It's T-boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision. \nINT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING \nThe cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear-view mirror as Will floors it toward a green light. \nWILL That guy got fucked up. \nIn the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond, maybe, to process their impending doom, and then - \nThe cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car. \nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nThe Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top. Its ruined back wheel catches, sending the car tumbling onto its roof. \nINT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING \nMadness. The guys scream as the car continues to slide, upside down, out of control. As it slams into a row of parking meters, the world goes \nBLACK \nWill blinks back to reality. He's hanging, inverted, by his seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles up at him. Hours could have passed, but it's only been seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact, still alive, he looks over at - \nVAUGHN I don't have any code. \nVaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops, looks purposefully down at Will's hand. Will draws back. \nWILL Listen, man, I just want the code. \nVAUGHN I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. \nWILL The code for the fucking bomb! \nWill opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back. \nVAUGHN What kind of stupid motherfucker wears a bomb to a drop? \nWILL Your boss put this on me. \nVAUGHN I am my boss. \nWILL Then give me the code! \nVAUGHN Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn code. Whoever told you I did, lied to you. Now step the fuck off, or I'll shoot you in the face so you don't explode and mess up my boots. \nVaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets in his way. \nWILL If you don't have the code, I want that money back. \nVAUGHN The only way you're getting this money back is if you kill me. \nWILL You don't know what I've gone through for that money! \nIn an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head. \nVAUGHN Do I look sympathetic? Now step the fuck aside. \nINT. SENTRA - DAY \nJuicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint. Then she spots \nEXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY \nChet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding, clutching a large metal pipe. \nJuicy jumps out of the Sentra. \nJUICY Vaughn, look out! \nVaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand. Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face. He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for another swing, when - \nJuicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing. \nWill grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens clear across the trunk. \nWILL Let's go! \nWill grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in. \nJuicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her behind, screaming and cursing. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING \nWill's mind is racing. \nWILL What the fuck was that? \nCHET They tried to screw us. You're a liability. They were just gonna let you blow up. \nWILL Not with the money they won't. \nINT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY \nA tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices, action figures and heavy metal posters. A low mechanical hum registers. \nDwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper. Dwayne holds up a mirror to check out his work. \nDWAYNE Never comes out this nice when I do it myself. You might wanna take some more off the top, though. I wanna look real professional when I go down to the morgue to identify the body. \nDwayne's phone chimes from a nearby counter. He grabs it, looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned. He answers - \nDWAYNE You drop the money yet? \nBut Dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is ringing. He puts it to his ear. The line connects - \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hello...who is this...hello...? \nDwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores. \nDWAYNE Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause she sounded cute for a bomb. \nJAY (SWALLOWS HARD) Gina Kim. My seventh grade crush. Or whoever lives in Gina Kim's house now. \nDWAYNE Where's the number for the bomb? \nJAY In my head. I switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit. You're out of control, Dwayne. \nDWAYNE I'm in perfect control! \nDwayne charges Jay. Jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon, flicks them on. Dwayne rips the cord out of the wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay's hand, then whips him with the cord. \nJAY Stop it! \nDwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot. Dwayne stumbles backward, falls onto the couch, groans - DWAYNE You asshole...I make you my partner and you pull this shit... JAY I'm tired of you pushing me around all the time! What kinda partner does that!? DWAYNE Fuck you...I'm gonna piss blood, aren't I? JAY That's what it said on the internet. Dwayne's phone rings in his pocket. DWAYNE Go on. Get it out for me. I can barely move. Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket...opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer - DWAYNE Glad you came to your senses. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY \nVaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell - \nVAUGHN Who the fuck do you think you're talking to!? \nDWAYNE (O.S.) I honestly don't know. \nVAUGHN Let me give you a hint: your boy just jumped me, tossed my bitch like a rag doll and split with the cash. \nDwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers - \nDWAYNE That guy's not my boy. He's a dick. I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion. \nVAUGHN (O.S.) Confusion? The only motherfucker that's confused is you. Apparently, you think you can fuck me and survive the day. \nDWAYNE I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking him. You gotta understand, you're like a pawn in a much larger game I'm playing here. \nVAUGHN (O.S.) Did you just call me a pawn, you stupid fuck!? \nDWAYNE I didn't mean it like that. I'm just juggling a whole lot of shit. \nVAUGHN (O.S.) I want my money. Right now. \nDWAYNE That may not be possible. (DELICATELY) I just want to put this out there, to keep you in the loop...but I may need to bump the hit. \nVaughn paces, furious. \nVAUGHN This isn't a reservation at Sizzler! You don't \"bump\" it! I want you to bring me my money right now, to where I am standing in this shit hole town, bleeding from the motherfucking face! \nDWAYNE (O.S.) I don't exactly have the money...give me some time and - \nVAUGHN The deal's off! You just became the hit! \nVaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and screams in frustration. \nJUICY He lives with his daddy. You already got the address. \nINT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY \nDwayne looks down at his phone. \nDWAYNE That's it. The assassin's gonna kill me now. I'm gonna die. Game fucking over. \nDwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks back and forth, wallowing in defeat. \nJAY We can still get him the money. Try the pizza guy back. \nDWAYNE Why? So he can fuck around again, and I wind up dead, anyway? No. I'd rather just sit here. I want to die right here on this couch. \nJAY No. We're gonna get that money. Just like we planned. All we gotta do is get the leverage back. \nDWAYNE How do we do that? Pizza boy's obviously got some kinda death wish. \nJay gathers his resolve. \nJAY We take the girl. The one he went to see. Then he won't try shit. \nDwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe. \nMAJOR You know, I saved a black man's life in the shit. So if I took yours I'd be even. \nVAUGHN I see where your son gets his common sense. (MORE) \nVAUGHN (CONT'D) But you might want to readjust your attitude, because I ain't fucking around. I want Dwayne. I don't know why you'd want to protect him, the motherfucker hired me to kill you. \nIf this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn't show it. \nVAUGHN Just tell me where he is! \nVaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun. \nMAJOR You think I'm scared of death? There's a whole generation of gooks that think I'm the grim reaper. \nVaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger - \nBut The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood. \nThe Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck. \nMAJOR I'll ride you all the way to hell! I know exactly how to get there! \nVaughn reaches for his gun. His fingers curl around it and he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards. \nVaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major. \nVAUGHN What now, old man!? You can't kill me! None of y'all can kill me! \nThe Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a loaded weapon. \nMAJOR Go on and - \nBANG! \nThe Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest. \nVaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood. He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs. \nINT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY \nVaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound. \nINT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY \nThe locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to stop and look out at him like guard dogs. \nVaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked. Takes out his gun and blows it open. \nVaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the tanning salon, etc. \nVAUGHN Motherfucker has lost his mind... \nHe finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower. \nVaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them - \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nWill and Chet are still arguing - \nCHET Look at the upshot, while you're behind bars you can finally finish your degree. If I was there, too, it would just be a distraction. \nWILL Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot. I'll just sit here and figure out a fucking major. \nWill stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket. It's vibrating. He pulls out his cell. \nWILL Hey, it's them. \nWill answers - \nWILL You ready to talk now? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING \nDwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear. Jay keeps watch on Kate in back. She is blindfolded, hands bound behind her back with duct tape. \nDWAYNE (INTO PHONE) Yeah, I'm ready to talk. I want my money. Meet me back at the radio tower in 50 minutes. \nDWAYNE How much time you got left? \nWill takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. He looks at the timer. \nWILL Ten minutes. \nDWAYNE Damn. Maybe we should just wait around for the money shot. \nThe guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag. \nDWAYNE That the money? \nWILL Maybe. Where's the girl? \nDwayne grins. \nDWAYNE In the van. Maybe. \nWILL Get her out here. You're wasting time. \nWill grips the bag close to him. \nDwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out. Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop. A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe- like device in his hand. \nJay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van. They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him. \nKATE Will, are you there? \nWILL I'm here. It's gonna be okay. \nDWAYNE This is a fucking tearjerker. \nWILL Just let her come over here. \nDWAYNE I will. But you should know, my associate over there is packing a flamethrower. \nJay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a button and a pilot light comes on. \nJAY (FLAT) Just do what we say. Don't mess around or anything. \nDWAYNE Unless either of you can outrun a 25- foot flame. (gestures to gun in his belt) Or a bullet. \nDwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes her behind him. \nWILL Get back. \nDWAYNE I gave you the girl. Now give me the money. \nWILL How about we get the code out of the way first, since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us. \nDWAYNE Fair enough. \nDwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket. \nDWAYNE (TAUNTING) You ready to be a free man? \nWILL Just give it to me! \nDWAYNE \nWill keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it. His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat. \nWill takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak. \nDWAYNE It's so fucking pretty, ain't it? \nJAY Yeah. It's awesome. \nDwayne looks up at Will. \nDWAYNE Okay, you can get out of here now. \nWILL I actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around, you're gonna put a bullet in both of our backs - and this is just a guess - burn our bodies. \nDWAYNE They say great minds think alike. And in this case, so do we. \nWILL I figured as much. That's why I got a gun pointed at you, too. (LOUDLY) I got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now. \nDWAYNE Do I look that dumb? \nThe body emits a low groan. Dwayne rolls it over. His father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak - \nMAJOR Dwayne... \nDWAYNE What happened to you? \nMAJOR Some guy...said you hired him to kill me. \nDWAYNE Dad, I...I'd never... \nMAJOR Look at you...lip quivering like you're getting fucked...be a man. \nDWAYNE I am a man! I killed you, didn't I? Now I'm gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks. \nThis stirs something in The Major. \nMAJOR You mean...like those whorehouses...in 'Nam...I used to tell you about? \nDwayne softens at the recollection. \nDWAYNE Those were great bedtime stories. \nThe Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone. Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way. \nMAJOR Medics are late...probably a couple lazy spicks...you tell 'em I said so...all right, son? \nDWAYNE Sure thing, pop. \nThe Major looks up at Dwayne's bruised face, as if for the first time. \nMAJOR Hell of thing...I think I may...actually respect you now. \nDwayne's eyes well up. He reaches out, cradles his father as he expires. It's like a very bloody, white trash version of the Piet\u00e0. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until - \nHe drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation. \nDWAYNE Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier! \nPULL AWAY as Dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow nearer. \nFADE OUT: \nBLACK. THE DARKNESS RIPPLES... \nInto waves. It's the ocean, long past sunset. PULL BACK to find a lone figure staring out at it, sitting on \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nWill. Shirtless. Could be anywhere. \nChet approaches and sits beside him. \nCHET Fucking nine dollars to use the internet. \nWILL And? \nCHET Police think it was that black guy. They found some kind of map in his car. And I'm sure racial profiling played a part. \nWILL But nothing about us? \nCHET Nope. Guess it's time to head back. \nWILL I was thinking we'd stick around a little a longer. \nCHET Why? So you have more time to delude my sister? \nWILL Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone. \nChet stares out at the ocean for a beat. \nCHET You really think she's into you? \nWILL (SWALLOWS HARD) I kissed her last night. No tongue. Then you walked in. \nChet just nods. Will gets up. \nCHET You're gonna go fuck my sister now, aren't you? \nWILL I'll be thinking of you the whole time. \n", "test1_input": "WILL Uh, no. Why? \nREGISTER WOMAN Because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone, and I want to make sure you all use protection. \nWILL Lady, we're just...buying some stuff. \nREGISTER WOMAN Is that cash or credit for your rape kit? \nWill looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card. Chet grabs his hand. \nCHET We'll pay cash. \nINT. MINIVAN - DAY \nThe van is parked. Dwayne sits behind the wheel. Metallica's \"Ride the Lightning\" begins to play loudly. \nDWAYNE You really fucked up this mix tape. \nDwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at Jay in the passenger seat. \nDWAYNE We're not speed freaks knocking off a 7-Eleven. We're masterminding a heist here. \nJAY Sorry, Dwayne. That song just means a lot to me. \nDwayne shakes his head. He turns and looks out the windshield: they're parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance. \nDWAYNE I wish he would hurry his shit up. \nJAY You worried about that other guy he's with? \nDWAYNE No, man. He picked him up at a school. So long as there ain't any cops, he can take the whole town with him. I just want my money. \nDwayne surveys the area. Something catches his attention: the bland strip mall across the street. There's a Blockbuster, Subway, and an empty space in between. Dwayne smiles. \nJAY What? You want me to run over to Subway, get us a couple sandwiches? \nDWAYNE If you had any vision, Jay, you'd know exactly what I'm thinking about right now. And it's not a sandwich. (BEAT) Look how well trafficked that shopping mall is. It's the perfect place for the tanning salon. \nJay checks it out, nods. \nJAY Oh, you're totally right. \nDWAYNE I've been thinking about it, and I want you to start off working the counter. Sounds like a demotion, I know, but it's an important position. Because we're gonna be using code words and shit. For example, if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan, that just means he wants a tan. But if he says he wants a \"deluxe tan,\" that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off. You with me? \nJAY So far. But what if he wants a fuck? \nDWAYNE There's gonna be codes for everything: missionary, anal, black chicks. I got it all written down back home in my files. (MORE) \nDWAYNE (CONT'D) I'm not gonna bother getting into it with you right now, because you're supposed to be on lookout and you're no good at multitasking. \nJAY Okay. 'Cause they're about to get away. \nDwayne spots the Mustang pulling away. \nDWAYNE Fuck. \nHe throws the van into gear. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING \nWill navigates the streets. Chet is in the back seat, where he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air pistols, and much of the car, black. \nWILL Be careful, you're getting paint everywhere. \nCHET Are you really worried about your upholstery right now? \nWILL Yes, because if I survive this shit I'm quitting my job. That means I'll probably have to give up my place and I'll be sleeping in the back of my car, which you're covering in toxic paint. \nChet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over. \nWILL That side isn't dry yet. You're about to ruin it. \nCHET It says it's fast drying. \nWILL Fast isn't the same as instant. You gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes. \nCHET How would you know? You do a lot of graffiti? \nWILL No, but I spray painted my bike last year after I got my license suspended. I didn't let it dry properly and I fucked it up. \n", "test1_true": "WILL I was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first. \nChet drops the spray paint, whirls on Will. \nCHET What? No way! We've got a car. \nWILL Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it as a getaway vehicle. They can trace the plates. Even if we do get away, we'll be arrested. \nCHET Well, I can't hotwire a fucking automobile, and neither can you. \nWILL That's why I was thinking we'd steal one from your parents' friends. The Fishers. Remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage? They leave the keys in there. And they have a Datsun. That's a fast car. \nCHET I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun. Let's steal a car from your parents' friends. \nWill seethes. He whips the car over to the side of the road and gets in Chet's face. \nWILL What friends? My parents don't have any. My dad moved away after your big mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him, and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard. \nCHET You never should have told me! I was 13 years old. I couldn't process that kind of information. I had to tell someone else. (shakes his head) Fuck. I really am sorry about it. Okay? Despite what I said before. I was just a kid, but I messed up. \nWILL Okay. \nChet looks at Will, expectantly. \nCHET That's it? You're not gonna apologize for selling my Cal Ripken ball? \nWILL Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and I was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the time. And that I needed some extra dough to indulge my habit. Which, in hindsight, was probably just a cry for help. But you never even noticed. \nCHET Thanks. Now I feel even worse. \nWill sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens - \nWILL I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I knew it was wrong and I regretted it like the next day. I actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much. I had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident. I guess that's why they call it a downward spiral. \nCHET I appreciate that you tried to buy it back. So, thanks. \nAn awkward moment passes. \nCHET We should probably get going. \nWill turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and - \nA horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at them. Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision. \nCHET Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn day to be over! \nAs Chet continues to freak - \nSUPER COUNTDOWN: 5 hours, 15 minutes... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY \nWill keeps watch of the house. Chet squeezes through a garage window he has pried open. \nINT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY \nChet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z. \nChet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters, hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a set of hooks on the wall. \nWILL The keys aren't here. They always used to leave the keys out. \nCHET Yeah. When we were teenagers. This is fucked. \nWILL Let's just find them. \nThe guys ransack the garage. Chet knocks over a shelf full of clutter. \nCHET Sorry. \nWill goes to the car and tries the handle. It's open. He scours the interior. \nCHET You hear that? \nWILL What? \nChet peeks through the glass pane in the door. \n", "test1_id": 1536, "test2_input": "Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to see what's what. Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL. \nDWAYNE You hear what happened to the guys they were after? \nRANDOM LOCAL Sounds like they got away. \nDwayne and Jay beam. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY \nThe guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on the lookout. They arrive at Will's parked Mustang. Will hugs the car. \nWILL I never thought I'd see you again. \nCHET I thought you hated this car. \nWILL It's actually not that bad. You know, as compared to that Datsun. The Mustang's got more comfortable seats. And it never would have flipped over. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY \nThe guys get in. They sit there for a moment, silent except for their heavy breathing. Will's eyes go to the garbage bag sitting between them. \nWILL There's a 100 grand in there. 100 fucking grand. Which we stole. From a bank. \nCHET I told a bunch of people I was gonna shoot someone. I was like \"you fucking move, and I will kill you where you stand!\" \nWILL I threatened to blow up a cop. (BEAT) And you never said \"I will kill you where you stand.\" \nCHET I know. But shit did get pretty crazy. \nWILL Yeah, it did. \nWill starts to get a little emotional. \nWILL You know, there's no one I would have rather taken down a fucking bank with. I mean that. \nChet smiles. \nCHET Me, neither. \nWILL And as for all that shit I said...and all that shit I did...I hope you can forgive me. We've been friends for so long, and I guess you hurt the people you're closest to the most. \nCHET I messed up, too. I'm a dude who slept with his best friend's ex- girlfriend, and destroyed his parents' marriage, and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral. I'm a shitty human being. But I'm glad you know that now, because you can accept me for who I am. \nWILL I do. I accept you. Because you accept me. \nWill goes in for a hug. Chet gets lost in the moment, before recoiling. \nCHET Woah! You still got a bomb on you. \nWILL You're right. Let's take care of that. But you owe me a hug. \nWill pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket. \nWILL It's all gravy from here. \nWill takes out his cell and dials the number. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nDwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald's. Dwayne stops and answers his vibrating cell phone. \nDWAYNE This who I think it is? WILL (O.S.) Can't you hear the ticking in the background? DWAYNE You know, you're a pretty funny guy. WILL (O.S.) Thanks. I'm happy to entertain a complete psychopath. DWAYNE Now wait a second, you're the murderer. WILL (O.S.) What's that supposed to mean? DWAYNE One of those cops who wrecked his car chasing you...he ain't breathing no more. Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet - WILL We killed a cop. CHET You were driving! I'm just an accomplice! WILL They're gonna hunt us down and kill us. Cops don't take this shit lightly. \nCHET I bet he had like eight kids. We have to find them and support his family forever. \nDwayne is holding back laughter. Finally bursts out. \nWILL (O.S.) What's so fucking funny!? \nDWAYNE I'm just messin' with you. You didn't kill anyone. How'd a moron like you manage to rob a bank? \nWILL (O.S.) Jesus! Can we just get this over with? Where do you want the money? \nDWAYNE There's a boarded up gas station out on Commerce Avenue, past the highway. Be there in 30 minutes. \nWILL (O.S.) I'll be there in ten. \n", "test2_true": "Dwayne hangs up. He dials another number - \nDWAYNE Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's on its way. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nThe Mustang shrieks past us. \nSUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MCDONALD'S - DAY \nDwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon. \nDWAYNE I remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces. Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease. The Major said I was the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care, I just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there. So, one night, I followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the Park Place piece. The million dollar prize. But he didn't know shit. A year later, The Major won the lotto. I asked him for a Sega Genesis. He bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached. \nDwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of Jay's. \nDWAYNE I'm not ashamed to admit that I've gone through some dark times since then. Depression. Addiction to a variety of shit, which I won't go into. I know you must think that's pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don't got shit going on as compared to me. But that's just the way it is. That's life. \nJay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him. \nJAY You know, I've been pretty low, too... if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff. \nDWAYNE No. I don't. My whole point I was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past. 'Cause I did it. I finally pulled it off. \nJAY We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two us. We're a good team. \nDWAYNE Are we? Would you do anything to protect me, my money, my empire? \nJAY Yeah, sure... (NERVOUS) I mean, like what kinda stuff are we talking about? \nDwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to Jay. \nDWAYNE Would you push the button? \nJAY Why would you want me to do that? \nDWAYNE It's just a question, Jay. Would you? If I asked you? (MORE) \nDWAYNE (CONT'D) I mean, it's no different than those watermelons. \nJAY Watermelons aren't alive. \nDWAYNE Yeah, they are. Not the ones you blew up, though. \nDwayne stares hard at Jay. A tense beat. \nJAY No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne? \nDWAYNE Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part. \nDwayne cracks a smile. \nDWAYNE Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop yet. I'm gonna go take a shit. Stay away from the bathroom. Someone could get hurt. \nDwayne heads off. Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind. \nEXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY \nWeeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen. \nWill spots Vaughn's Sentra approach. It pulls into the station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing. Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat. \nWILL Where are the other guys? \nVAUGHN I'm the only guy. (BEAT) You got it? \nWill picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over to Vaughn. He opens it, looks in. \nVAUGHN What the fuck did you do...rob a bank? \nWILL (INCREDULOUS) Yes. \nVaughn grins. \nWILL Now where's the code? \n", "test2_id": 1537, "test3_input": "It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being that it's out of bullets. \nDwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash. \nVaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him. \nSOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask, frantically looks around. The money is gone. \nDWAYNE No!! \nJay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy, he somehow manages to string together two coherent words - \nJAY Dwayne! Help! \nDwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take? \nDWAYNE Goddamn it, Jay! \nDwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down. \nDWAYNE Stop, drop and roll! \nJay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames, finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out. \nJay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes. \nJAY You came back for me...you said you never would. \nDWAYNE You didn't hesitate back there, Jay. You did good. \nJay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them. \nDWAYNE I'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money. Think you can get outta here? \nJAY Yeah. Go get him. \nDwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Mustang travels away from the rising flames. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING \nWill's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked. \nKate looks from one of them to the other. \nKATE Uh...I just got kidnapped. \nCHET Yeah, that was totally Will's fault. In case you want to factor that in while you're mulling over the whole relationship thing. \nWILL I'm very sorry about the kidnapping. This is me, taking responsibility for it. Growing up. Like a viable life partner. \nCHET This man has spied on you in the nude before! \nWILL What? No, I didn't. \nCHET He's lying. He's trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies. And it won't stand. \nKATE I just got kidnapped! Can we talk about that!? \nSomething catches Will's attention: a set of headlights rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror. \nINT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING \nDwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph. His eyes burn with intensity. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING \nWill hits the gas. \nWILL Oh, shit. One of those dudes is definitely not dead! \nChet and Kate look out the back window. Chet screams - \nCHET Hurry up! He's already on us! \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING \nWill looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes aim. He flashes a sick grin - \nDWAYNE I own this town. \nBefore Dwayne can get a shot off - \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nAn explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It lands on its roof and skids into a ditch. \nINT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING \nChet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window. They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive. \nKATE What the hell was that? \nWILL That was the bomb I carried around all day. I reactivated it and put it in the back of his van. I guess his time was up. \nCHET \"His time was up?\" Were you thinking that up the whole day? \nWILL I was prepared, yes. I can't help it if I'm the kind of guy who thinks about the future. \nCHET (TO KATE) He's not that kind of guy. He doesn't think about the future. Ever. \nKATE What exactly happened since I saw you this afternoon? \nWILL Primarily, we robbed a bank. \nKATE What!? So you're, like, fugitives? What do we do now? \nCHET Yeah, Will. What does the future hold? \nWILL Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us. Kate, I think you should put in for that vacation time. Right now. If anyone gives you a problem, tell them to fuck off. There's 100 grand in that trash bag by your feet. A third of it's yours. \nKate opens the bag...smiles through the dirt and grime. \nKATE Will, that's - \nCHET Fucked up. Why does she get a share? \nWILL Why do you get a share? \nChet stews. Will catches Kate's eyes in the rear-view. \nWILL Airport's 30 minutes away. Pick a destination. This time it's not a practice run. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe car zooms off. \nSUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - NIGHT \nWind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as - \nDwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered mess, but he is alive. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nDwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride. \nINT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut. \nFrom where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all fours to investigate... \nIt is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father, lying face down. Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy. \nDWAYNE Dad? \nDwayne inches closer, pokes the body. Nothing. \nDWAYNE Dad, are you - \n", "test3_id": 1538}

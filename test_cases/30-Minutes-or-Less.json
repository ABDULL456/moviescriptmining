{"test1_input": "DWAYNE (CONT'D) You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year. \nDwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest. \nDWAYNE It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours. \nHe hands Will a slip of paper. \nDWAYNE Once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it. You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want. (BEAT) Now let me demonstrate what happens if you don't get us the money. \nDwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. Dwayne mimes answering a phone - \nDWAYNE Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that? You don't have the money? It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? Well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up. \nJay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes. All that remains is a cloud of stuffing. \nWill is frozen in fear. \nDWAYNE I liked that bear. I don't even know you. \nDwayne throws Will his car keys. \nDWAYNE Go on. Get outta here. \nWILL Guys, can we please just talk about this? \nDWAYNE Yeah, of course we can. \nDwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet. Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side. \nDWAYNE Be careful! \nWill awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the engine and backs away - \nDWAYNE That's right! Get the fuck out of here! You're wasting time! \nOnce the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne stays primate. \nJAY What the hell, Dwayne? You told me that was a replica gun. \nDWAYNE It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. Now it goes boom. \nJAY We didn't discuss a loaded gun! Especially not with the bomb around! \nDwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion. \nDWAYNE Don't you ever question me. I'm fucking this bitch. You're just holding the camera. \nJAY (VOICE FALTERS) Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say. \nDWAYNE Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines. This is cash money. You hesitate, you fuck up...and I will leave you behind. \nA tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm. \nDWAYNE Let's go get some breakfast. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nWill's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop, tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and pukes. He drops to his knees. \nWILL Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me! Someone please fucking help me! \nNothing but the wind. \nWill fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth. He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts. He pauses on Chet's name...presses send. \nThe line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer: 7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car. \nINT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nA laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map. \nChet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates with his laser pointer - \nCHET This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase. \nSEVENTH GRADER (COUGHING) Nice laser. \nThe class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer. \n", "test1_true": "CHET Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3. \nChet opens the door. \nCHET What do you want? \nWILL We gotta talk. \nCHET I'm working here. Do not mess with me at work. \nWILL Chet, for the love of god, just talk to me in private for one minute. \nChet sighs. \nINT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nChet leads a jumpy Will into \nINT. EMPTY CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nChet shuts the door behind them. Will paces. \nCHET You wanna apologize, don't you? You look like shit. You've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were. Well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling - \nWILL (SUDDENLY) Chet! Shut up! I don't wanna apologize to you! \nCHET Then what do you want? Because we don't have anything left to say to each other. \nWill swallows hard. \nWILL Here goes. And this is gonna sound crazy. Because it is fucking crazy. But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now I have less than eight hours to rob a bank. \nChet just stares at Will, unimpressed. \nCHET You're hysterical. Got me. Great joke. I'm going back to work now. \nWill steps in Chet's way. He unbuttons his jacket, revealing the bomb. \nCHET What the fuck? Is that real? \nWill nods. \nChet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom. He presses himself flat against the wall. \nCHET Stay away from me! What the fuck are you involved in!? Terrorism!? \nWILL Chet, do you really think I'm a terrorist? \nCHET Yes! One of the dumb ones! The ones they convince to wear the bombs! \nWILL I am not fucking around here. Two guys did this to me. And if I don't rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow. \nCHET Seriously? \nWILL Seriously. \nCHET And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children? \nWILL I didn't - \nCHET Just back the fuck away from me with that thing. \nWill backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom. \nWILL Listen, I think the vest is safe for now. These guys don't want me to blow myself up on accident before I get their money. \nCHET Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe? There's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design!? \nWILL I don't know! All I do know is that this is real. This is happening. And I'm sure you hate me as much as I hate you right now, but I have nowhere else to go. \nCHET For what? \nWILL For help, Chet. I need your help. Please. I can't do this alone. \nChet looks Will over. His desperation is palpable. Chet bites his lip, weighing the situation... \nCHET Damn it! (takes a breath) I'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is...I'm a better man than you. And someday, I might actually forgive you. So if I let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people. Like my wife and kids and shit. \nWILL That's a...very rational way to look at the situation. (GENUINELY) And you're right, about being a better guy than me. \n", "test1_id": 1536, "test2_input": "Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him. \nWILL Stop! \nWill takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate's phone rings. She answers it, confused. \nKATE What are you doing? \nWe STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring. \nWILL Just don't come any closer. \nKATE Why not? What's going on? \nWILL I'm gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation, so please be cool. (BEAT) Some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime. \nKATE Will, I swear, if this is - \nWILL I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I know it's a lot to swallow, but you gotta take it on face value, because there's a timer attached to this thing and it's counting down. \nKate's voice falters - \nKATE Oh my god, Will...we'll get help. I'll get you help. \nWILL I didn't come here for help. I'm taking care of it. I came here because, should things not work out today as I would like them to, I want you to know why I was doing the things I did. \nKATE Please, just let me call someone. Let me do something. This is crazy! \nWILL I don't disagree with you. It's fucking nuts. But that's not even what this is about. (STRUGGLING) Do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you, me and Chet, with Chet cut out of it? \nKATE Will, I can't remember about some stupid picture while you're - \nWILL I need you to remember about the picture, and about how I stop by your office every Friday, and how I've always hated all your boyfriends, and how the two girls I've ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you. (BEAT) Do you see where I'm going with this? I love you Kate. I have for a very long time. \nKate is barely holding it together. \nKATE Will, this is a lot you're putting on me! You just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me. What the fuck is going on? \nWILL A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do this to you, but I was afraid I'd never get the chance to tell you. And I know you have feelings for me, too. Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother. (MORE) \nWILL (CONT'D) But what I hope is that you don't really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you'll realize it's the same way I feel for you. Does that make any sense? \nKATE Yes. I mean, I've known you forever. It's not an easy thing to figure out. \nWILL I don't need an answer now. Just think about it. And no matter what you decide, you're too good for assholes like Mark and the rest of them. \nKate manages a small, stifled laugh. \nKATE Okay. I will process all of this. It's just, the bomb - \nWILL It's distracting. I know. Anyway, I'd love to stay and talk some more, but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave now, because I'm running out of time. \nKate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will - \nKATE If I had time to think about it...I'd probably tell you that I've always felt very strongly for you. And I've never thought of you as a brother. \nWill smiles, yells back - \nWILL That's a huge relief. Don't say anything else. I just really don't want to die now. \nKATE Try not to. Please. \nKate turns and continues to the access door. \nINT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nJay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof. He hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for the nearest floor. He tries the door, but it's locked. \nKate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots Jay trying to force the door open. She is holding back tears. He just looks incredibly confused. \nJAY I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper. I'm looking for Mr. Quilby. \nKATE I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. \nKate continues down the stairs, tears coming now. Jay waits a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next level, which is open. \nINT. MINIVAN - DAY \nJay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing. \n", "test2_true": "JAY It was just his girlfriend or something. \nDWAYNE Getting one last blow job in case he don't make it. I kinda like this guy. \nINT. DATSUN - DAY \nWill, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside. \nCHET Did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was 13? That always works. \nWILL I said my piece. She's gonna think about it. \nCHET Shut up. She was freaked out. \nWILL Yes. By the bomb. \nCHET By you. \nWILL Would it be so bad if we ended up together? You and I would be family. \nCHET I don't want you in the family. You bring very little to the table. I want her to be with someone awesome. A pro quarterback. A war hero. At the very least, someone I've never watched porn with. \nWILL Well, now it's up to her. \nCHET Not if I set that bomb off myself. \nWILL Then you'd probably never get to rob a bank. \nWill throws the car into gear and pulls away. \nSUPER COUNTDOWN: 4 hours, 10 minutes... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY \nThe Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air pistol tucked into their pants. \nWILL You go for the money. I'll cover the crowd. In and out. \nChet clasps his hands around his stomach. \nCHET I'm not feeling so good. I drank like three of those 5-Hour Energy drinks. \nWILL It's just nerves. Let's pull our shit together and do this thing. \nChet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank. \nThe guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski masks down and take out their air pistols. \nCHET What should I call you in there, like if I need to ask you to do something? \nWILL Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius. \nCHET I can tell you're not a black guy through the ski mask. \nWILL Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers and that's the way we gotta roll when we get in there. \nINT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY \nIt's business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as many EMPLOYEES. They all just want to get done with their shit and go home, when - \nWill and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand. \nWILL Everybody put your hands in the air! \nCHET No, get on the ground! \nWILL Actually, listen to him and get on the fucking ground! \nWill and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns everywhere. People scream. \nWILL Shut up! Please! \nWill frantically scans the panicked crowd for - \nThe SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy. Will points his gun right at him. \nWILL You, just stand right there and don't do shit! The rest of you get the fuck down! Spread your arms and legs! Why is no one listening to me!? \n", "test2_id": 1537, "test3_input": "SECURITY GUARD Just take it easy, man! \nWILL Don't be a hero, cowboy! \nSECURITY GUARD What the fuck does that mean? I'm not a hero! Or a cowboy! \nAs people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one ANOTHER - \nChet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass partition. \nCHET All of you, back away from the counter and get out here! Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot! \nThe Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs. \nWill looks to the Guard. \nWILL Very slowly, take out your gun and toss it away. \nThe Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and - \nRight into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s), whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform. \nMOM Oh, god! I don't want the gun! \nWILL (TO GUARD) What the fuck!? Did you do that on purpose!? \nSECURITY GUARD It was an accident! \nCHET Are you guys working together? \nMOM No! Please take this gun away! \nWILL Just toss it, lady! \nThe Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and \nBLAM! \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Ah! \nA FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh. \nFAT MAN I think she got the femoral artery! \nMOM I'm sorry! It was an accident! \nFAT MAN Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!? \nDAUGHTER Mommy, what's happening!? \nMOM Christi, be quiet. These men are dangerous. \nChet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently - \nCHET This is fucked. That dude is gonna bleed out and we're gonna go to prison. \nWILL Just calm down. \nFAT MAN Why is no one getting me help!? \nWILL Is anyone here a doctor? \nNothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people. \nWill hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging his leg. \nWILL Sir, let me see where you're hit. \nFAT MAN Just call me an ambulance! \nWILL Calm down, sir. \nThe Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of blood. \nWILL It's just a flesh wound. You're gonna be okay. \nFAT MAN But it hurts so bad. \nWILL You got shot, man. It's not supposed to feel good. But you're gonna be fine. And you'll have a great story to tell everyone. \n", "test3_true": "WILL Point taken. Luis, how we doing on the money? \nChet snaps back to attention - \nCHET Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz. \nChet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20- something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks her name tag: SANDRA. \nCHET Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out of here. This will all be over and you'll be fine. You trust me? \nSandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as - \nFAT MAN My leg really hurts! \nWILL Can you please hurry up, Sandra!? \nSandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag. Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread across the floor. \nWILL I'm really sorry, everyone. I know we probably fucked up your day. (looks to Fat Man) I'm thinking of you in particular, sir. Actually, you know what... \nWill crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag. \nWILL Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me. Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm coming for you. I remember faces. \nThe Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it - \nRed Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls on the teller. \nCHET What the fuck was that about, Sandra? I thought we had something going! What happened to trust? \nSANDRA I'm sorry! They make us do it! \nWILL Could you kindly fill another bag? Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage bag. And Luis, will you watch her this time? \nSandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash. \nCHET Okay. That should be enough. \nChet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are home free, until - \nThey hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers. \nWILL Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!? \nSANDRA No! It was Mark! He pushed the button when you guys came in! \nAnother teller, MARK, looks up from the floor. \nMARK Sandra, you bitch! Now they're gonna kill us both! \nSANDRA Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager! \nWill loses his shit - \nWILL Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you! I'm a regular guy! Just like you! I'm a regular guy and you fucked me! Thank you for fucking a regular guy! \nPeople are freaked out. Sandra is crying, thinking she will probably get shot now. \nChet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door. \nCHET Let's just get the fuck out of here. \nThe guys slam through the doors, out into \nEXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY \nJust as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off. \nOFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs. \nOFFICER ZURMAN Drop your weapons! \nCHET Don't shoot us! \nOFFICER ZURMAN Drop the guns or I'll have to! \nChet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance, they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires. \nWILL Fuck you! You just brought a gun to a bomb fight, officer! I pull these wires out and we all go! You got ten seconds to drop your gun and - \n", "test3_id": 1538}

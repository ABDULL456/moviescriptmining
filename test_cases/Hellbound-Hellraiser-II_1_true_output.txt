For a moment, MALAHIDE's face is stone. Then, slowly, he returns her smile and, drawing his lighter, lights her cigarette. 
58   INT.   SHOPPING MALL   DAY 
A large multi-level shopping complex obviously up-market and expensive. 
We see MALAHIDE, riding up one on the central escalators, looking around him as he does so, as if searching for a specific shop. 
He reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of the several avenues that lead away from the central square containing the escalators. 
He walks past several shops, looking in their windows; a chic specialty shop, a window full of clocks, a cutler's. Finally, he stops in front of one. He stares at its display window. 
The window is classily minimal. There is in fact only one dress in it. It is an exquisite white cocktail gown. The gown is full length but quite tight-fitting, merely flaring a little from below the knee, and has a halter-neck. 
MALAHIDE walks into the shop. 
59   INT.   MALAHIDE'S BEDROOM   DAY 
We are looking at a reflection of MALAHIDE in the large mirror that covers the inside of his wardrobe door. His real hand and his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door and tip it slightly, changing the image that the mirror shows us. 
Now we see JULIA. She is in the dress from the shop in the mall. It is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well. Being a halter-neck, however, her skinned arms and shoulders are completely bare. Also, it is quite low cut at the front, exposing a fair degree of visceral cleavage, and at the back. 
JULIA turns fully around in front of the mirror examining herself from every angle. Her mood is unreadable until she speaks. 
JULIA Close it. 
MALAHIDE does so. He understands and tries to console her.. 
MALAHIDE It's a beautiful dress... 
JULIA I know. 
TIME CUT 
59   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY 
CLOSE UP MALAHIDE'S hands applying wide, white, surgical bandages to JULIA. 
We pull out as MALAHIDE steps away from JULIA. They are both standing in the middle of the living room floor. 
JULIA'S arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in neatly and professionally applied bandages. There are three slits for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely covered. Over these she is still wearing the white dress. 
MALAHIDE There... 
JULIA lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her bandaged face. She turns towards MALAHIDE. The camera begins the same circling movement it made around them the previous night. 
MALAHIDE'S nervousness has practically disappeared. He has helped this woman. He has bandaged her and dressed her. He is slightly in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear. 
The camera's circling grows faster. 
MALAHIDE Well? 
JULIA walks towards him, slowly raising her hands. When she is close enough her hands cup his cheeks. She pulls him towards her, and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him. Her body moulds itself to his. 
She leans her head back. Were they have kissed blood has pressed up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh. It looks like smeared lipstick. 
JULIA Well? 
MALAHIDE puts his arms around her waist. They kiss tenderly. Slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on her buttocks and presses her in towards him. They begin to spin themselves now, echoing the camera movements. 
They cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest against the wall that bears JULIA's bloody palm print. JULIA twists their bodies so that MALAHIDE is pressed against the wall, and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against MALAHIDE. 
The camera is stationary now, watching without movement as MALAHIDE begins to raise JULIA's dress up her legs, her hand on his wrist, helping and encouraging. 
About halfway up the thigh, the bandaging disappears and the raw flesh is exposed. 
The kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making fast and violent love against the wall. 
His hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face away from the kissing to loan it on her shoulder so that we see his face as it grimaces in ecstasy. 
He cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements stop.

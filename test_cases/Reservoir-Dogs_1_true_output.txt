MR. WHITE It makes perfect fuckin sense to me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did. 
Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body. 
MR. PINK He's right about the ear, it's hacked off. 
EDDIE (to Mr. Orange) Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you.  Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram.  That's your story? I'm correct about that, right? 
MR. ORANGE Eddie, you can believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth.  I swear on my mother's eternal soul that's what happened. 
The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie. 
There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has said.  Finally: 
EDDIE You're a fuckin liar.  Now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened? 
MR. WHITE (OS) He told you what really happened. You just can't deal with it. 
MR. ORANGE (OS) Okay, you're right, I'm lying. Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm not above pullin a fast one.  Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that, I shot him 'cause I didn't like his hair style.  I didn't like his shoes either.  If it has just been his hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said, let him live.  But hair and footwear together, he's a goner. 
EDDIE The man you killed was just released from prison.  He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.  He could've walked away.  All he had to do was say my dad's name.  But instead he shut his mouth and did his time.  He did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man.  And we were very grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off? 
Silence. 
EDDIE Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me what really happened? 
VOICE (OS) Why?  It'll just be more bullshit. 
Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room. 
JOE (pointing to Mr. Orange) This man set us up. 
CAMERA does a 360 around the men. 
EDDIE Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. 
JOE That's okay, Eddie, I do. 
MR. WHITE (to Joe) What the fuck are you talking about? 
JOE (pointing to Mr. Orange) That piece of shit.  Workin with the cops. 
MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE What? 
JOE I said this lump of shit is workin with the LAPD. 
MR. ORANGE'S POV 
Looking up from the floor at everybody. 
Joe looks down at Mr. Orange. 
JOE Aren't you? 
MR. ORANGE (OS) I don't have the slightest fuckin idea what you're talkin about.

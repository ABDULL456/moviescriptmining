GLENDA HELLER - 50's, desperate - peeks her head out of the kitchen. She holds a coffee mug filled with gin on the rocks. 
GLENDA Ope - I thought you were your Dad. 
CINDY Just us. 
Cindy kisses her mom on the cheek, can smell the alcohol. 
GLENDA How was the beauty shop? 
INT. HELLER HOME - FOYER - LATER - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
The front door opens and COLONEL JERRY - 65, wound tighter than a navy knot - enters. Glenda, rushes to greet him. 
JERRY Get that fucking dog out of the kitchen! 
INT. HELLER HOME - DINING ROOM - EVENING - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
GLENDA, JERRY AND GRAMMA Come lord Jesus, be our guest, and let Thy gifts to us be blessed. Amen. 
Glenda, Jerry, Gramma Francis and Cindy sit around a dining room table. Glenda slices a knife through a greenish meatloaf. She serves a watery slice to Gramma. 
GRAMMA Thank you. 
Glenda averts her eyes. She cuts another slice. Cindy offers Glenda her plate. The meat breaks apart and half of it lands on the table cloth. A brownish-green oil. 
CINDY It's OK mom.

Cindy picks up the fallen particles with her fork. Jerry's eyes burn into Glenda. She won't look at him. 
GLENDA Can I have your plate Dad? 
He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner. Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red... 
Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf, obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere. Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles. 
JERRY What'd you do to meatloaf? Huh?! 
GLENDA They had it ready-made in the deli. I... thought it looked good. 
JERRY Are you kidding me? How long does it take to make a meatloaf? Five minutes? You mean to tell me that you didn't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up since six this morning busting my fucking ass and you don't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? 
GLENDA I thought it would be nice. 
JERRY Nice? 
GLENDA ...for a change... 
JERRY Well, what gave you the idea that any of us needed a change? Did you ask for a change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for anything... She doesn't talk. You didn't ask for a change, did you mom?...She can't hear! And I don't remember asking for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it? You wanted a change. I work all day so you can sit on your fat ass, thinkin' about yourself. How you'd like a change.

GLENDA Sorry. 
JERRY Sorry? What good is sorry now? 
GLENDA Do you want me to make you some eggs? 
JERRY I want you to enjoy your fucking dinner. 
He storms out of the dining room. Glenda, Cindy and Gramma sit in silence. Cindy takes a bite. 
CINDY It's not bad. 
GLENDA Oh bullshit. 
Glenda retreats into the kitchen. Gramma and Cindy eat. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...When I was a young physician, I used to leave the hospital everyday in tears.

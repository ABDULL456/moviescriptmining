SPOCK Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. 
KIRK That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I. 
SPOCK Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command. 
KIRK But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you... 
SPOCK You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. 
Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment. 
KIRK You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. 
SPOCK I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. (pause) Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. 
KIRK I would not presume to debate you. 
SPOCK That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. 
KIRK Or the one. 
Spock inclines his head. 
SPOCK You are my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours. 
Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally: 
KIRK Will you accompany me to the bridge? 
SPOCK I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets. 
Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice. 
58   EXT. SPACE STATION REGULA I                                 58 
Floating quietly around the planet below. Tranquil as we PUSH SLOWLY IN. 
OVER we can hear, FILTERED, UHURA'S VOICE: 
UHURA'S VOICE Regula I, this is Enterprise. This is Enterprise calling. Do you receive... I say... 
59   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      59 
Featuring Spock and Uhura, as she keeps trying -- 
UHURA ... Again, this is Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please. Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please -- it's no use; no response from Regula I. 
SPOCK But no longer jammed? 
UHURA No, sir. No nothing. 
Spock considers, moves to Kirk. 
SPOCK There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond. 
KIRK How far? 
SPOCK Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed. 
KIRK Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom? 
SPOCK It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was. 
Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now. 
KIRK Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the con. 
They start for the Turbo Lifts as Saavik reacts -- 
60   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                        60 
BONES I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on? 
KIRK (dims lights) Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. 
COMPUTER VOICE Identify for retina scan. 
KIRK Kirk, Admiral James T., Starfleet General Staff. Security Class 1. 
The screen is suddenly busy with coded read-outs and then computer graphics of retina patterns. Then it glows green. SECURITY CLEARANCE, CLASS 1 GRANTED. 
KIRK (continuing) Summary, please. 
More coded read-outs, a red line SECURITY SCAN, then over it APPROVED, in green. Replaced by:

Irv shakes his head with sympathy for Cris' plight. 
IRV In that case, you've gotta leave the country. 
CRIS I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first. 
IRV What? 
Cris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant. 
IRV Cris? 
Cris focuses. 
CRIS She's coming here. The Fed. 
IRV You gotta go? 
Cris thinks. Shakes his head. 
CRIS Let's play it out. 
INT. Irv's kitchen - DAY 
Cris makes a lamb roast, studding it with cloves of garlic. 
CRIS I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific. (places roast in pan) Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee. 
IRV Then what the hell are you waiting for? 
Cris puts the roasting pan in the oven. 
CRIS Her. 
IRV Who? 
CRIS I haven't met her yet. 
IRV Then find somebody else! 
CRIS It has to be her. 
IRV What's so special about this one? 
CRIS She's the mother of my child. 
Irv stops shuffling the cards. 
IRV I thought you were shooting blanks. 
CRIS I guess the doctors were wrong. 
IRV I don't mean to be indelicate, my friend, but how do you know the little bastard is yours? 
CRIS He's got my thing. 
IRV Your thing? 
Cris holds up his hand, revealing that the skin between his two middle fingers is webbed a little higher than normal. 
CRIS My thing. 
IRV I still don't understand why you never got that fixed. 
Cris laughs...then suddenly stops. 
cris She's here. 
He walks to the door and opens it to discover Ferris standing there, with her finger about to press the doorbell. 
CRIS Agent Ferris, come in. 
She regards Cris with appreciation. 
FERRIS One step ahead of the game. 
cRIS Always. 
She enters. Tries not to be intimidated by his ability or appearance. Sees Irv, watching them. 
Ferris Is there some place we can speak privately? 
CRIS Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven. 
IrV No, you two stay here. I'll watch the food. 
Once out of Ferris' eyeline, Irv queries Cris with his hand in the shape of a gun. Cris shakes his head, then turns to Ferris - and waits for her to begin. 
FERRIS You're wasting your life, Cris. You have the most amazing talent, and you're running from it. 
CRIS Yeah, people say I could have been a chef. 
Ferris Don't be cute. There's too much at stake here. 
Her gravity anchors him. 
FERRIS Now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people, I believe you. Why else would you kill a stranger? 
Cris guards his reaction. 
FERRIS But no good deed goes unpunished, eh? (MORE) 
FERRIS (cont'd) And that's how it's going to be in this world. People will either hate you or want to exploit you. 
CRIS Everyone but you, of course. 
FERRIS I can fix your legal problems. More importantly, I can give you a chance to use your gift.

Carl FUMPHERS. 
YOUNG ELLIE Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed. 
YOUNG ELLIE What's wrong? Can't you talk? Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens. 
YOUNG ELLIE Hey, I don't bite. She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl. 
YOUNG ELLIE You and me, we're in a club now. 
Carl smiles. 
YOUNG ELLIE I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it! 
Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in. 
YOUNG ELLIE My name's Ellie. 
She grabs his hand. Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room. 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS 
YOUNG ELLIE There it is. 
Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS. 
YOUNG ELLIE Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam. 
YOUNG ELLIE Go on. 
Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY 
Ambulance.    SIREN blaring. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
One lone light on upstairs. 
INT. CARL'S ROOM 
Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST. 
Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON. Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright. 
YOUNG CARL (re: arm) Ow! 
A head pops up from outside the open window. 
YOUNG ELLIE Hey kid!! 
Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast. 
YOUNG CARL Ow!! 
Ellie climbs in the window. 
YOUNG ELLIE Thought you might need a little cheerin' up. I got somethin' to show ya! 
INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret. 
YOUNG ELLIE I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl's eyes widen in alarm. 
YOUNG ELLIE You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods. 
YOUNG ELLIE Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils... 
YOUNG ELLIE My Adventure Book! It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz. 
YOUNG ELLIE You know him. Carl smiles excitedly. 
YOUNG ELLIE Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America. She turns the page to a map.

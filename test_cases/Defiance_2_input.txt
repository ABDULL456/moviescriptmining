109 THE RUSSIAN WINTER (MONTAGE- MUSIC OVER) 109 SNOW covers the camp. A driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it. 
109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes. 
ASAEL There is talk of returning to the ghetto. 
TUVIA Madness. 
ASAEL They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment. 
TUVIA Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes. 
109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him. 
109AB LATER - IN THE FOOD LINE 109AB A whisper runs through the group..."meat"..."what kind?"..." Where'd it come from?" Tuvia watches them eat hungrily.

109E A STABLE - NIGHT 109E Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it. 
VIKTOR Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains: 
VIKTOR (CONT'D) More dead soldiers than empty bottles. 
ZUS (slurring his words) That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug. 
VIKTOR At least you drink like one. 
ZUS 'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at. 
VIKTOR So tell me about this brother of yours... 
ZUS .Asael? 
VIKTOR You are such an idiot.

DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 71A. 
109E CONTINUED: 109E 
ZUS I know who you mean... The Great Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit. 
VIKTOR You compete with him. 
ZUS He competes with me. 
VIKTOR My older brother and I have the same relationship. 
ZUS He is a Big Shit also? 
VIKTOR A soldier. (a long moment) He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit. 
109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused. 
TUVIA Lilka? 
LILKA Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more. 
LILKA (CONT'D) ...Every time new people come into camp, I keep hoping... even though, I know... (her teeth are 
CHATTERING) ...I'm sorry. 
TUVIA Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed. 
LILKA You too? 
TUVIA (a small nod) Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders.

DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 71B. 
109F CONTINUED: 109F 
LILKA No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty. 
TUVIA I will have Asael send someone else. 
LILKA No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver.

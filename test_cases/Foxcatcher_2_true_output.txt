EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MORNING 
An M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is off-loaded from the back of a wide-load army trailer. A DELIVERY CORPORAL directs the operation. Du Pont watches. 
CORPORAL That's one beautiful vehicle. 
The CORPORAL watches du Pont climb atop the APC. 
DU PONT Where's the grenade launcher? 
CORPORAL I'm sorry? 
DU PONT The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here. 
The Corporal pages through the sheets of his delivery order. 
CORPORAL I don't know, sir. I don't... I don't see anything in the order - 
DU PONT - It goes right here. Right here. 
CORPORAL Yes, it does. It does mount right there on the top. 
DU PONT So where is it?

Drizzling. Du Pont sits in the M-113 APC, his torso sticks out the top. He TURNS IT ON, the engine roaring to life.

Dave is being interviewed for the documentary. He stands in his workout clothes, in front of the camera crew. Some of the wrestlers work out behind him. Dave's reading much of what he says from CUE CARDS held near the camera. 
DAVE My name's Dave Schultz. I'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher, under Head Coach John "Eagle" du Pont -

Dave's voice continues - 
DAVE (V.O.) - Coach du Pont, uh, understands excellence, he represents... excellence, he expects it from his ATHLETES - 
Du Pont drives the APC over a little ridge and starts down a long slope toward the POND.

DAVE (halting; trying so hard) - His... commitment to this sport is complete. He's made himself um, an... an expert in the sport of wrestling... 
Dave, who's been so good at playing along, takes it too far even for himself. As he says the next bit, he stumbles over his words - 
DAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... to - what we're trying to accomplish here. (looks down, UNCOMFORTABLE) We... consider John... (QUIETLY) one of us. (MORE) 
DAVE (CONT'D) (SO QUIETLY) One of us.

Du Pont drives the APC down the slope, into the POND. He continues driving as the tank goes lower and lower in the water -- the water covers the vehicle, then his torso, his neck, his head. And he's gone. Completely submerged. 
Beat. Beat. The surface of the water is still. Beat.

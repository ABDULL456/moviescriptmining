{"train": "FLASH GORDON \nWritten by \nLorenzo Semple Jr. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING \nAt first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums beating in the distance coming from some unknown place. \nThe sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT. \nThe sky echoes with THUNDER. \nWe hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing. \nUnder FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning blood-red savanna. \nEXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY \nI's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds. \nINT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY \nThere are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN, a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled \"KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A Guide to Survival In The City.\" A few rows forward, near the open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON. He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows indicating the directions of movement. \nSuddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture that's habitual to her in moments of stress. \nThere's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily, leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS. \nINT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS (CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT) \nFLASH What was that, fellas? \nPILOT Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing SERIOUS \nCO-PILOT But nothing you'd want to toss a third-down pass through either -- (Grinning back at FLASH) Can I have an autograph for my kid, Mr. Gordon? \nFLASH Sure -- my pleasure. \nAs FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane takes another jolt, even more violent than the first. \nPILOT Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see what they've got. \nFLASH I sure hope we don't have to turn back. I mean this is first day of training camp, I wouldn't want to be LATE -- \nPILOT Seat-belt time. \nFLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders violently. He holds on, calls up front: \nFLASH Maybe it'd be smoother if you went HIGHER -- \nDALE Will you SHUT UP? (as FLASH's head SWIVELS) Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have their hands full -- just let 'em drive. \nINT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS (DALE, FLASH) \nThe plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it to her. \nFLASH When you're nervous, it can help to chew on something \nDALE Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough to take candy from a stranger? \nFLASH I'm not a stranger exactly -- You know my name. \nZARKOV I can't handle the capsule alone get your toothbrush. \nINT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV (CO-PILOT, PILOT) \nThe PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief. They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe. \nPILOT What's ,e word from Westchester Approach, Bill? \nCO-PILOT Zip. All chanels dead. (Reacting to the panel) Say, get a load of the VOR's.... \nThe directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the sky and swallows. \nPILOT On the left, about six o'clock high...... \nThe racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE. \nPILOT (CONT'D) Hold on tight, let's put baby down right here...... \nThe CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nThe cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves. FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward. \nINT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS (DALE, FLASH) \nThe TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals. DALE lurches in against the tornado. \nDALE Can you fly it? \nFLASH I can fly all right -- I've had a couple of lessons! -- just don't if I can land! (MORE) \nFLASH (CONT'D) (FIGHTING CONTROLS) Grab that other wheel! Help me pull her up! \nDALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the wheel in front of her. \nDALE Oh boy! Ever hear about the man who fell ninety stories from a window and didn't break a bone? \nFLASH No but I'd sure like to! How'd The man fall ninety stories didn't break a bone? \nDALE The window was ninety-one stories up! \nSHOOTING FORWARD - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD \nThe Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting. We get a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a flat area. \nAnother barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all around the plane but just miss it. \nINT. COCKPIT (FLASH) \nFLASH Brace yourself I'm aiming at that field up ahead! \nEXT. ZARKOV'S GREENHOUSE - DAY (ZARKOV'S VOICE) \nIts thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we HEAR a furious echoing VOICE: \nZARKOV'S VOICE I see you, Munson! Come out or I shoot! \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY (MUNSON, ZARKOV) \nZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he was hiding. \nMUNSON So what's it matter if I'm shot or go up in that thing? I'm a goner either way, right? \nZARKOV Of course -- I admit that! But this way you'll be giving your life for a chance of saving Earth! Haven't you any spirit at all?? \nNow it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a gun at him. \nZARKOV Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead of me -- quick! -- (as they gape at him, FROZEN) Quick I said: We haven't much time -- Earth is being attacked! -- there's only one slim chance of saving it! \nFLASH Mister, you are insane! \nHOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry foliage bursts into FLAME. \nZARKOV Up the stairs -- RUN! \nZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead of ZARKOV. \nFLASH Go with the flow -- wait for a chance! \nBelow them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH. \nINT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV) \nZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that open. \nOn every side things are blowing up and burning under the merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on, but does not even leave a mark. \nZARKOV I need your help to take off! Get in or I shot you dead! \nDALE gasps and shrinks back. \nFLASH Take off for where? \nZARKOV God only knows -- whatever black corner of space this is coming from -- wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge into the devil's heart and destroy him! We'll die ourselves, of course, but our names will be honored till the end of time! \nDALE Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze tours -- never. \nFLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off- balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her. \nINT. CAPSULE (DALE, ZARKOV) \nIt is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is from everyday science. \nImmediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity, ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH. \nZARKOV Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal! \nDALE Flash! Sack him! \nZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again. Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch. \nThe capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy. \nFLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh. \nWe move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving as he speaks with enormous effort: \nZARKOV, Friendship...Built this to send to them in...Friendship...The end now...End of the world....Unless we (every sound an effort NOW) Unless...We...Three...Can... \nZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness. \nEXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE) \nTotally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire. The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking up speed again as it ascends. \nEXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT \nWhirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into space. \nEXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV \nFLASH Made it where, Doctor? \nZARKOV I don't know. \nSuddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching. \nDALE Don't. Suddenly I like it in here just fine -- \nEXT. GRASSY AREA - DAY (ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV) \nThe door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader. \nFLASH Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon -- can you understand me? (SILENCE) We're from EARTH -- we come as friends. \nZARKOV (URGENT) Extend your hand! That's the gesture of friendship known everywhere! \nWith a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand. \nFLASH Hi! \nCLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S wrist and he is thrown to \u00b7the ground as other RED MEN advance to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV. \nLEADER You are prisoners. I will take you now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of the universe! \nARMORED MEN (CHORUS) Hail, Ming! \nGroggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV. \nFLASH Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll call my own play. \nEXT. GRASSY AREA - POV THROUGH OPENING (DALE, FLASH) \nAnother strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN, as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close. \nDALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along. \nDALE Just do what I'm doing. Flash -- \nFLASH What are you doing? \nDALE Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked us to Disneyland. \nINT. MAIN PALACE HALL (ARMORED MEN) \nA gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the middle to form a throne. \nMING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before him. \nARMORED MEN Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without Mercy! \nA hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the left of the group. \nINT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES (ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES, ZARKOV) \nAs FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces \nbending away into caverns of gloom without measurable dimension. \nWe pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME- NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to unearthly music. \nZARKOV Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and out the other side -- to this. Who said Hans Zarkov was mad? \nDALE You're mad. \nLook down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire. \nKLYTUS This woman will amuse you. \nZARKOV (INTERESTED) Klytus can see the future, eh? \nMING He can foresee it -- but for a few moments only. It gives him a unique gift for survival, -- and treachery. \nZARKOV Extraordinary. I'd like to study his beta factors -- I wager I could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise. (peering at KLYTUS) Tell me -- when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle? Here? \nMING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN. \nMING Chain this one up. Preserve him for further examination. \nLEADER Hail, Ming! \nZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away. \nFLASH Oh no you don't! We came together and we're STAYING together! \nLanguidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger. \nMING That one is useless to us. Remove him and kill him. \nShock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in front of her friend. \nDALE You dirty old bastard can kill me too! \nCLOSE ANGLE - AURA \nWetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING: \nAURA Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him to me! \nMING (EYEBROWS UP) What would your Prince Barin say? \nAURA I can handle Barin. \nMING Really, Aura -- your appetites are too monstrous -- even for our family. This could cause great trouble with Barin -- I must forbid it. \nAURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she WHISPERS AGAIN: \nAURA But you adore me, Father -- you ca refuse me nothing . Yes? \nWIDER SHOT \nAs MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter and indicates DALE. \nMING Take the Earth-woman to our quarters! Bathe and annoint her for our pleasure! \nA HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE. \nFLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city- girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own prowess. \nDALE My God -- and I thought that book was another rip-off- \nFLASH Watch out! Behind you! \nThree more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards DALE. \nQUICK ANGLES \nFLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one. He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it quickly to knock cold the other two. \nAURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth. \nPanting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised mace. \nNO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone. Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own question with a licentious smile. \nINT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT (AURA, FLASH) \nIt is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us. \nAURA Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle after we hit the water -- I'll lead you! \nFLASH Hit what water? \nIn answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH. \nINT. UNDERWATER (TANK) \nFLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low opening. \nINT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO (AURA, FLASH, PLASH) \nFLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He stares at her. \nAURA Catch your breath -- then I'll take you up and find you a disguise. \nFLASH You're saving my life. How can I Thank you? \nAURA I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria - we'll find a way. \nFLASH Let's get one thing straight -- I've got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov too -- rescue them and try to save Earth too. \nAURA Do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter? \nFLASH I'm no good at lying. \nAURA You're funny -- are all Eathlings like you, Flash Gordon? \nPLASH I guess I'm about average. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR (AURA, FLASH) \nThere are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking in through the tinted glass. \nWHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN \nAn infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES who toil in rythmic unison. \nFLASH (O.S.) What's that? \nAURA (O.S.) The plasma core. It's e source of the energy-beam my father ia aiming at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is merciless and all-powerful! \nANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES \nShowing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN, waiting like executioners to perform this chore. \nAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D) The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they had their own water Kingdom, the fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to rebel. They will suffer for it here forever. \nFLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He reacts. \nINT. GROTTO - HIS POV IN CAVERN - ON A CATWALK (AURA) \nZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel. \nFLASH and AURA \nAURA You can't reach him. If a soldier spots you, it's instant death! -- Come! \nAURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her. \nZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome. \nAn astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph, slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view below a veil of clouds. \nZARKOV Earth! \nMING Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it will be, when my plasma reaches full force..... \nA sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN. ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys again. \nMING (CONT'D) And as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died. Earth reborn! A pleasant image, no? \nThe fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed. \nZARKOV But that's impossible! Even your perverted genius can't create new life! \nMING Of course I can create life. There's nothing easier. It only requires myself and one woman. \nZARKOV (SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING) Dale Arden..... \nMING Who else? As in that childish myth of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it? I will breed with her and repopulate the Earth in my own image. I've already done it on over a thousand planets. \nMING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye catches something else. \nWHAT HE SEES \nA big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded in it, just their hilts sticking out. \nANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't budge. \nMING (CONT'D) The magic blades are not for your kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other will only be withdrawn by my rightful heir. Pull on them with all your MIGHT: \nZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He falls panting over the block. \nZARKOV Monster! \nMING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER. \nMING Return him to the dungeon. \nINT. MING'S SERAGLIO (DALE, HEDONIA) \nDALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place, being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful. \nTickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green liquid. \nHEDONIA Drink this. \nDALE recoils, her giggling cut short. \nDALE What is it -- some rotten drug? \nHEDONIA It has no name. But many brave men died to bring it across space from Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It will make your hours with Ming more agreeable. \nWith a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry. \nHEDONIA (CONT'D) We are of different race, Dale Arden but we all are women here. I know your fears. Believe me, it will be better if you drink it... \nHEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout! \nDALE Flash! Where are you?? \nOf course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks it. Her expression changes. \nDALE (CONT'D) Say, this stuff isn't bad at all. \nShowing the windblown surface of the moon ARDENTIA dead ahead. \nINT. COCKPIT (AURA, FLASH) \nAURA Are you mad> We're diving straight at Ardentia! \nFLASH That's right, Princess \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 and we're not pulling out until you put that gadget over my head and tune me in to Dale Arden! \nAURA struggles wildly, but FLASH'S grip on her wrists is like iron. The surface of Ardentia LOOMS UP , closer and closer. \nINT. MING'S SERAGLIO - BATHING AREA (DALE, FLASH'S VOICE, HEDONIA) \nDALE is immersed naked in a bubbly swirling tub, a luxuriant prisoner of the FEMALES who bathe and groom her. She seems dazed by steam and by the sensuous movement of the water. \nA couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of them. HEDONIA pours rich oil into it. \nHEDONIA Rub this on your body. It gives Ming pleasure. \nDALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere, though it seems very close: \nFLASH'S VOICE Dale, it's me -- Flash! Am I with you? \nCU DALE \nShe blinks, befuddled, pauses in her oiling of herself. \nHEDONIA What's the matter? \nDALE I'm dreaming. \nINT. COCKPIT (FLASH'S VOICE) \nCU FLASH \nwith the Thought Transference gizmo down over his head, a faint BLUISH GLOW flickering within, as AURA watches him and we SEE the moon Ardentia falling behind rapidly through the glass. FLASH concentrates fiercely. We HEAR his VOICED THOUGHTS but his lips do not move. \nFLASH'S VOICE No, Dale -- you're not dreaming I'm Flash -- I'm with you and you are with me! \nINT. MING'S BATHING AREA (DALE'S VOICE, FLASH'S VOICE, FLASH' S VOICE) \nFLASH'S VOICE Are you receiving my thoughts? \nNow we HEAR DALE'S VOICE, without her lips moving either: \nDALE'S VOICE I'm receiving something -- \nFLASH' S VOICE (EXCITEDLY) I read you, Dale -- I'm getting you too! Think of me -- hard! \nINTERCUTS - FLASH AND DALE - SERAGLIO BATH AND COCKPIT \nAs they communicate. NOTE: There might be some faint glow in the air above the tub some spectral suggestion. of FLASH'S presence, the idea being to show that HEDONIA and other FEMALES are unaware of this interchange going on as they continue to bathe and groom DALE. \nINT. CUTTING BETWEEN BATHING AREA AND COCKPIT (DALE'S VOICE, FLASH'S VOICE, FLASH' S VOICE) \nDALE'S VOICE Where are you Flash? \nFLASH'S VOICE Speeding for the Kingdom of Arboria to get help! I'm in a spacecraft with Aura, Ming's daughter! \nDALE'S VOICE What? That bitch? Don't trust her! She's after you! \nFLASH'S VOICE Listen, she means nothing to me -- not a darn thing. Where are you, Dale? \nDALE'S VOICE Naked in a bathtub. \nFLASH'S VOICE (CHOKED) Oh God -- if I could only see you, Dale. If I could touch you -- what are you in a tub for? \nDALE (easy, smiling) Very. \nSERVING GIRL Do you need any more of this? \nDALE No, thanks. Just turn down the light a bit, would you? I'm shy. \nThe SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so. We GLIMPSE DALE'S HAND rising quickly to deliver a karate-chop. \nINT. PALACE HALLWAY \nMING walks down it toward a closed door at the end. He pauses a moment in anticipation, composes himself, opens the door. \nINT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER \nIt's nearly dark. MING comes from shadows, looks down at the bed. There is a feminine silhouette on it. \nMING sits, extends a hand. His FINGERS travel sensuously up a BARE THIGH, suddenly stop. \nSavagely, MING pulls the face of the GIRL into the light. It is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now dressed in DALE'S gown. \nINT. DUNGEON - MING' S PALACE (GUARD) \nOPENING CLOSE on ZARKOV, who lies asleep in his chains. A hand touches his shoulder. \nZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over him, tray in hand. She moves her cloak to reveal that she is DALE. \nA GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow of a cowled uniform. \nGUARD Serving Girl - what business have you in this dungeon? \nDALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her knee. \nThe legs are long and terrific. \nThe GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right- left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck. \nHe is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key- ring at his belt. \nEXT. ARBORIA FOREST - FLASH AND AURA (AURA, FLASH) \nMaking their way swiftly through it between earth and heaven, crossing this green world on branches and trunks of monster vines. FLASH pauses. \nFLASH Listen -- are you sure this Barin will help me? \nGently, provocatively, AURA puts her finger on his lips to silence him. \nAURA Ssssh...... Trust me! \nEXT. ARBORIA - FULL SHOT (AURA, FLASH) \nOf a fantastic structure, many levels, built of wood and other materials from the heart of the forest. \nMOVE OFF it to find FLASH and AURA nearby, him gazing at this apparition with a strange wistful expression. \nFLASH It's amazing -- I dreamed of this tree-house when I was a kid -- \nAURA laughs softly, waves him on. \nWITH FLASH AND AURA \nclimbing the ramp-like stairs which wind up around it in a mounting spiral. SUddenly the forest rings with SINGSONG CRIES and CALLS I mingled with a sort of ROARING SNARL. \nAURA It's Barin's hunt! Watch! \nAURA leads him on at a run to the wide balcony above. \nA DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS. \nFLASH and TIGER MAN \nSEEING cold death staring them in the face. \nFLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it. \nTREE MAN LEADER You haven't a chance! Throw down your weapon! \nFLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES. \nTREE MEN ON BRANCH \nAre startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE. \nBARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW \nHEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes, holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face, BARIN resumes his climb. \nEXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA (FLASH, TIGER MAN) \nFLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf, near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand on. \nFLASH Which way to the border: \nTIGER MAN Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean to the west. \nFLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west. \nTREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES \nFLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable. FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next. \nAmazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up. \nAN ENORMOUS FLOWER \nis right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND. With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into the flower's maw. \nPLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks him flat. \nINT. FLOWER (BARIN, FLASH) \nFLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES. Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE MEN who have been fed in here. \nSWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into crystalline ICE. \nThe tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below beside the TIGER MAN. \nTREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE \nAs FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away. \nBARIN I saved you because your death must be mine. \nFLASH What's the point of all this killing? Why don't we team up and overthrow Ming? \nBARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE: \nA WINGED SILHOUETTE \nDiving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE AIR. \nOTHER HAWKMEN \nZARKOV (CONT'D) Neat trick. I wonder if it's controllable? \nSHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE Looks up and SCREAMS. \nHAWKMEN \nSwoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did with FLASH AND TIGER MAN. \nINT. MING'S DOME ROOM (KLYTUS, MING) \nCU MING \nIn his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK. KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN. \nKLYTUS Mongo is restless today. Your vessels stray from their appointed kingdoms.... \nMING That damned Vultan -- time I clipped his wings once and for all. We could put those insolent Hawkmen of his to work in the plasma cavern ---- \nKLYTUS Dale Arden and Flash Gordon? Will I send out the Imperial Fleet to bring them back? \nMING We'll let Vultan tame her first -- I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after him. Flash Gordon is nobody. \nKLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him questioningly. \nKLYTUS Sire, it is not for me to tell Great, Ming that he is making mistakes. \nEXT. SKY - WIDE SHOT (HAWKMAN, TIGER MAN) \nSerried squadrons of HAWKMEN escort the ones bearing FLASH, BARIN and TIGER MAN through space. \nCLOSER - TIGER MAN \nStruggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling and roaring. He butts one in the belly with his horn. \nHAWKMAN Want us to let you go, et? \nTIGER MAN Yes!! \nHAWKMAN Okay. \nTIGER MAN Nooo!!! \nSKY - WIDE PANORAMA \nLight streams rough tremendous El Greco clouds. HAWKMEN Are tiny figures, rising against it. \nHigher, higher. Above the clouds a blinding DAZZLE comes INTO FRAME. It resolves into a fantastic SKY PALACE hanging in mid-air, reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and terraces. The HAWKMEN climb above it. \nCLOSER HAWKMEN \nCarrying FLASH and BARIN and TIGER MAN , going into a screaming dive. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - HAWKMEN POV \nRushing at us with horrifying speed. ZOOMING DOWN we see a dark opening. The wind howling around wings, we rush dizzingly into the aperture. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - VULTAN'S EYRIE - A HIGH TERRACE (DALE) \nVULTAN circles admiringly around DALE. VULTAN is a lusty viking of the sky, winged like his men, one eye blinded, his beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE slaps his hand away. \nDALE Watch out, you old bird -- Ming wants to marry me. \nVULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - ANOTHER LEVEL (BARIN, DALE, FLASH, SARIN, VULTAN, ZARKOV, ZAAKOV) \nFLASH We're all Ming's prisoners. I say let's team up and smash him. \nTIGER MAN (O.S.) Listen to his words! -- \nANOTHER TERRACE - TIGER MAN \nOn his feet on the other terrace, shouting across: \nTIGER MAN (CONT'D) I know -- I'm only an ignorant Tiger Man -- but I tell you Flash Gordon is the leader we've waited for! \nBACK TO VULTAN'S TERRACE \nWhere VULTAN gazes at TIGER MAN a beat, then turns mocking eyes on FLASH. \nVULTAN You're a leader, he? \nFLASH Well, back home it's what I'm paid for -- I called a pretty good game against the Dallas Cowboys once --- \nVULTAN (TO BARIN) Do you understand him? \nBARIN Not a word. (LIKE ICE) I was hunting him when you seized me. Before you finish me. Vultan I beg only that you let me finish him. \nFLASH Oh god -- here we go again -- \nDALE Is everyone on Mongo CRAZY? Haven't you guys ever heard of TEAMWORK? \nFLASH (TO BARIN) When I had that damn snake in my hand, I could've poked it in your face and KILLED you. \nBARIN I had you in bow-sight you were dead! \nVULTAN Enough! (shouting to all around) These vagrants talk a brave fight, my Hawkmen! Shall we test their words? \nQUICK CUTS - HAWKPEOPLE \nCHEERING AND SHOUTING eagerly from all around: \nHAWKPEOPLE Test them! -- Let's have sport! The joust! -- To the joust! -- \nCU VULTAN \nVULTAN Take them below -- put them together. \nINT. SKY PALACE - A RAMP (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV) \nVULTAN leads the way down. FLASH, BARIN, DALE, ZAAKOV and TIGER MAN are escorted by many fierce HAWKMEN. \nDALE Flash - don't do this. \nFLASH (low, bitter) I've got to. \nDALE Why? \nZARKOV He has no choice, Dale it's the Mongo way. \nDALE I'm so homesick -- what I wouldn't give for a nice quiet night with some muggers in Central Park -- \nFLASH squeezes DALE'S hand. \nAhead appears an archway opening to the sky. A GREAT GONG is heard. \nANOTHER TERRACE \nANGLE - HAWKMAN appears with a mallet, he beats again on a huge bronze GONG. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - WIDE SHOT \nDALE Fit me with what? \nHEDONIA Your wedding dress. \nEXT. ARBORIA - VINCINITY OF LODGE \nTREE MEN and LION MEN and TIGER MAN toil together in peaceful concernt, constructing a crude wooden launch-gantry around ZARKOV'S SPACE CAPSULE, which has been conveyed here. \nSeveral hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables as the work is completed. Capsule door is open. Through it we see ZARKOV at work inside, feverishly re-wiring a control panel. \nEXT. LODGE BALCONY (BARIN, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV'S VOICE) \nUp on Lodge Balcony, FLASH, BARIN and VULTAN lean over a table on which maps and drawings are laid out, a typical military staff meeting. With a bit of charcoal, BARIN sketches a semi-circular line over a map of MING'S city. \nBARIN A force-field covers the whole city, from here to here. With luck, Flash can lure them into lowering their defenses. \nVULTAN What if he fails? (ABRUPTLY) This is suicide, Barin! I can't order my men to suicide! \nVULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on: \nVULTAN (CONT'D) The flight brought me back to my senses -- good luck and goodbye. \nBARIN Ming destroyed your kingdom! \nVULTAN We'll build another. \nBARIN Vultan! \nFLASH Let him go -- I understand. (up to Vultan) Thanks anyway for getting us this far! \nVULTAN hesitates a moment, the soars away with determination. \nZARKOV'S VOICE Flash! Ready for a test! \nINT. CAPSULE (FLASH, ZARKOV) \nFLASH ENTERS \nFLASH What's the game-plan? \nZARKOV Sit there. When I give you zero, punch that button. Any questions? \nEXT. CAPSULE (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV) \nZARKOV jumps out, leaving the door open. He crouches low. BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching. \nZARKOV Five, four, three, two, one -- ZERO! \nInterior of the capsule is filled with BLINDING BLUE LIGHT for an instant. ZARKOV pops up, sticks his head in. \nZARKOV (CONT'D) Flash! (NO REPLY) Do you hear me, Flash? Where are you? \nCU ZARKOV \nAs INVISIBLE HANDS turn around the helmet on his head. \nZARKOV (CONT'D) Eureka! I did it! You can come out now, Flash -- \nFLASH'S VOICE Not unless you get out of my way, I CAN'T -- \nBACK TO MAIN SCENE - EXT. CAPSULE \nZARKOV moves inside. \nBARIN Look -- he still casts a shadow: \nCapsule sits in its launch-gantry, amidst the ruined blight left by the ray attack. There is not a soul in sight. Then Flash's SHADOW moves quickly over the ground toward the Capsule and VANISHES into the hatch. The door shuts itself. \nINT. CAPSULE \nControl levers move. A red button depresses itself. Through the side, which we should remember is transparent from within, we SEE the scene outside going into a GREEN-BROWN BLUR as the capsule starts to spin for takeoff. \nINT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER (KLYTUS, MING) \nMING is being robed by TWO GIRL ATTENDANTS. Suddenly KLYTUS is there in a shadow, smiling. MING senses him, turns. \nMING Well? What is it this time? \nKLYTUS I can't remember. I feel danger -- but I cannot see it. \nMING Klytus, you're impossible. Aura deserves you. \nKLYTUS I foresee another thing. In one minute exactly, the Earthling space capsule will be seen on the scanner. \nKLYTUS is swallowed again in shadow. \nEXT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT \nSailing over the ever frozen Moon of FRIGIA \nINT. MING'S DOME (CAPTIN, MING) \nCapsule is SEEN on the viewing screen, grid-lines dancing over the image as FRIGORIA is left behind. Watching are MING, KLYTUS, the CAPTAIN and several other SOLDIERS. \nCAPTIN Shall I disintegrate it, Your Majesty? \nMING No, Captain -- bring it in. Land it to a warm reception. \nINT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT (FLASH'S VOICE) \nThrough the front we see MING'S CITY dead ahead and below. Numbers flash on the navigation display, constantly changing. \nINVISIBLE HAND picks up a microphone, holds it before INVISIBLE LIPS. \nFLASH'S VOICE Vultan! Do you read me? \nEXT. ARBORIA - IN A BROWN BLASTED TREE (FLASH'S VOICE, VULTAN) \nVULTAN and some other HAWKMEN perch, listening to VOICE coming from a radio in VULTAN'S belt. \nFLASH'S VOICE Flash Gordon calling Vultan! Over! \nVULTAN doesn't stir a feather. After a moment: \nFLASH'S VOICE (CONT'D) Okay, don't answer -- I'm on Hawkman frequency I know you are reading me. Now get this -- \nCAPSULE AND TREE IN ARBORIA \nINTERCUTS \nFLASH'S VOICE (CONT'D) I'm being guided through the force- field under their control. You're on the beam when you've got the tops of two towers lined up exactly -- the high gold one behind the green one with the blue flag got that? (SILENCE) Okay, Vultan, it's your decision the ball is in your court -- I hope I'll be seeing you, you crazy ole bird. \nThe microphone hangs itself up on the panel. \nVULTAN AND HIS HAWKMEN \nJust sit there, grim-faced. VULTAN shake his head. \nVULTAN He calls us crazy -- \nEXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS (GUARD CAPTAIN, KLYTUS) \nINT. DUNGEON (FLASH'S VOICE) \nZARKOV, BARIN and TIGER MAN lie in chains, heads cocked at SOUNDS of the facas outside. THUD of a body falling, brief silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK. \nThe door opens itself. \nFLASH'S VOICE It's me! \nINT. NARROW VERTICAL SHAFT (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV) \nThe Same one AURA and FLASH fell down originally. Now BARIN, ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in. back-to-back pairs, feet pressed out against the shaft walls. What makes it look even stranger, half of the FLASH-BARIN twosome is INVISIBLE. Low conversation as they pant and struggle up the SHAFT: \nZARKOV How do we get down to the plasma level? \nFLASH'S VOICE Anti-gravity shaft -- I got a guard to show me -- \nBARIN This won't be easy, Flash -- \nFLASH'S VOICE Nothing's easy on Mongo -- \nINT. PLASMA CAVERN (CONTROLLER, GUARD CAPTAIN) \nLIZARD MEN SLAVES work like mad, shoveling radioactive fuel into the seething mass. \nON THE MEZZANINE \nCONTROLLERS are at consoles. Many GUARDS stand around. Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with each flare-up from the inferno below, inches toward a RED SECTOR. \nGUARD CAPTAIN Faster! -- More fueld! \nCONTROLLER What's the hurry? \nCONTROLLER What's the hurry? \nGUARD CAPTAIN He wants to give Dale Arden the final destruction of Earth as a wedding present. \nCONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs. \nTortured SLAVES howl in agony. Some drop and are thrown into the fiery mass, others redouble their efforts. \nON THE MEZZANINE \nThe needle quivers upwards. MOVE OFF it to a slot-like window in back wall. There are EYES behind the glass. \nINT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, TIGER MAN, ZARKOV) \nZARKOV,BARIN and TIGER MAN crouch amidst WHIRRING ventilators, watching through the window. \nBARIN How's it look to yoU? \nZARKOV Bad. Plasma's contracting into a critical mass. When that needle hits the red, Earth is finished. \nTIGER MAN Grrao! I'll charge down at them: \nZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of his fighting stance. \nLow door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes in. \nFLASH'S VOICE Cavern is sealed tight -- every door locked from the inside -- \nCU ZARKOV \nHope drains from his expression. \nZARKOV Let's face it, my friends -- without a miracle, we've lost. \nINT. DOME (OFFICER) \nOFFICER Man the battlements! \nEXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS \nHAWKMEN descend as SOLDIERS rush out at them. The battle is epic, a crazy combination of swords and ray-guns and clubs and spears. \nVULTAN is a towering figure in the middle of it, dealing havoc on all sides. \nAs he fights THREE SOLDIERS, ANOTHER races at VULTAN'S back with a deadly spear. Suddenly he TRIPS OVER NOTHING and crashes headlong to be dispatched by another HAWKMAN. VULTAN whirls and is amazed to have his freehand warmly clasped by an INVISIBLE ONE. \nINT. A PALACE ANTECHAMBER (KLYTUS, MING, OFFICER) \nMING and KLYTUS, in ceremonial robes. As part of his costume MING wears a sword. \nMING You have the ring? \nKLYTUS In my pocket. \nDoor flies open, an OFFICER dashes in. \nOFFICER Your Majesty, we're under attack by Hawkmen! \nMING So what are you doing down here, coward? Why aren't you in the fray? \nOFFICER Sire, I thought you'd -- \nMING Mingo City is impregnable! I'm not about to put off wedding Dale Arden for this! \nEXT. BATTLEMENTS (FLASH'S VOICE, HAWKMAN CAPTAIN, VULTAN) \nThe battle continues. Bloodies HAWKMAN CAPTAIN fights his way up beside VULTAN, who is engaged in seizing a dominant piece of ray-gun artillery. \nHAWKMAN CAPTAIN What's for us after this lot? \nVULTAN Ming! \nFLASH'S VOICE The cavern first! Gotta get Zarkov in there to -- \nSuddenly MUSIC is heard from below. Some great electronic organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably \"Here Come The Bride\".... the familiar thrilling wedding-march. \nFLASH'S VOICE (CONT'D) On my god! \nINT. MING'S GREAT HALL - HIGH WIDE ANGLE \nA magnificent wedding is on. DALE marches slowly up the middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march at her back with spears. Her long train passes between the AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS. \nAn aged HIGH PRIEST waits at the throne-altar with MING, whose eyes lecherously devour his approaching bride. \nCLOSE ON DALE \nHer beauty only enhanced by the teas rolling soundlessly down her cheeks. \nINT. PLASMA CAVERN \nThe molten mass is more intense than we have ever seen it, scarcely bearable to the eye. \nINT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE (TIGER MAN, ZARKOV) \nEven in here there is a terrible glare from the slot-window, ZARKOV turns his face away suddenly, infinitely sad. \nZARKOV I can't watch any more. To think of all our history ended this way -- the incredible ascent from primordial slime to Albert Einstein and Dale Arden and -- \nTIGER MAN (AT WINDOW) Look! \nThe sword slowly advances. \nFEATURE MING \nHis face contorted, he flies at INVISIBLE FLASH behind the sword. FLASH parries the blow. Astonishing pyrotechnics as the blades hit each other. Shrieking MONGONS flee under showers of fire. \nINT. PLASMA CAVERN (ZARKOV) \nHAWKMEN and LIZARD MEN SLAVES engage MING'S PEOPLE. \nAided by VULTAN and TIGER MAN, ZARKOV battles his way up to the Mezzanine Control area. He shouts down wildly: \nZARKOV Attach the electrodes to the shovels! Pitch them into the plasma! \nINT. GREAT HALL (BARIN, DALE, KLYTUS) \nMING and FLASH \nDuel dazzlingly around the enormous throne. Suddenly FLASH starts to lose his invisibility. A pair of eyes appears, the tip of a nose, parts of limbs. \nCU DALE \nPinned by AMAZONS, reacting to that. \nDALE Flash -- look out -- you're coming back! He can see you now, Flash! \nFLASH and MING \nFLASH pauses to look at himself, almost gets his head lopped off by a fiery slash from MING, recovers to bound up higher on the vast throne statue wheron they battle. \nPULL UP. In the f.g. the image of EARTH slowly turns and glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds. \nBARIN and KLYTUS \nDuel in another area of e Hall. A thrust by BARIN catches KLYTUS on the forehead. KLYTUS springs back, blood gushing down over his eyes. \nKLYTUS I foresaw at blow -- \nBARIN You're blinded, Klytus -- drop your sword! \nKLYTUS laughs, reaches up and throws off his helmet, WHIRLS in a lightning way to reveal \nANOTHER FACE \nShadowed, hideous, marked with all the evil in the universe. It's mouth emits a raging SCREAM. \nBARIN \nLunges with horror, slashes with his sword point. \nKLYTUS'S CHEEK \nIs slashed but grotesquely does not bleed. \nBARIN and KLYTUS \nFly at each other again, trade blows, then each catches a wrist of the other with his free hand. KLYTUS laughs horribly. \nKLYTUS You fight me in vain, Barin I do not foresee my death at your hands -- \nKLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp, drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust. \nKLYTUS'S FACE \nSuddenly changes horribly. PULL BACK. AURA is behind him, her hand on the hilt of BARIN'S sword, which she has driven into KLYTUS' back. Soundless, dead, KLYTUS falls to the floor. \n", "test1_input": "AURA It's so long since I've been with you, Barin -- I couldn't stand it. Please don't be too angry at me for coming. \nBARIN Angry at you? \nBARIN laughs. \nINT. LODGE (AURA, BARIN, FLASH) \nFLASH is flattened against the wall, IWATCHING through louvers of a door. SOUND of feet on ramp, SNARLING and ROARING of captive TIGER MAN. BARIN comes hastening INTO VIEW on the balcony and embraces AURA. \nAURA AND BARIN CLOSE \nBARIN You'll stay the night? \nAURA I've dreamed of it! \nHis eyes alight with anticipation, BARIN steps back from her. as his MEN arrive with the netted TIGER MAN. \nBARIN Get me a sword -- (turning to AURA) This is the fiercest Tiger Man we have ever hunted. I'm going to kill him now -- and dedicate his blood to you, my beloved. \nAURA (DELIGHTED) But that's treason! Blood can be dedicated to Ming alone! \nBARIN I know you, Aura -- the more a man risks, the greater your passion. If I knew a greater risk, I'd take it. \nAURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior. \nAURA Flash Gordon -- come out! \nFLASH steps out, halts about ten feet from BARIN. Reactions from BARIN and his TREE MEN. \nFLASH I'm from Earth, Prince Barin. My friends and I were Ming's prisoners. She kindly brought me here to enlist your help. \nBARIN What in hell? My help? \nAURA Hide him from my father -- don't let him wander -- keep him for me! \nCU - FLASH \nFLASH Keep me for.....???? (STUNNED) Oh, my god. I trusted you. \nAURA darts INTO SHOT, puts her lips to his ear and WHISPERS: \nAURA You still must -- I'm playing a game! \nCU BARIN \nBARIN What? What are you saying? \nAURA darts back into shot on his side now, WHISPERS in same WAY: \nAURA He's a mere toy to me, my love -- when I'm tired of it we'll kill him! \nBACK TO SCENE \nas AURA quickly steps away, continues aloud: \nAURA (CONT'D) It's the risk I ask, Barin hide him for me in Arboria. \nBARIN I'll hide him, all right -- under six feet of Arborian dirt! \nThe sword BARIN ordered has been brought. He seizes it. \nFLASH I'm not your enemy, Prince Barin. we share a hatred of Ming \nAURA Are you so afraid of my Earthling, Barin; Won't you even give him a chance? \n", "test1_true": "BARIN Snake keeper! Rouse your beast! \nANGLE - SNAKE KEEPER \nA HALFWIT TREE MAN, drowsing against another part of the parapet, He jerks awake, shuffles across to a big wicker basket, pulls off the lid. A hideous EEL-LIKE SERPANT rears it's head, HISSING and SNAPPING venemously. The KEEPER sticks his arm down. The snake coils around it. With a drooling grin, the KEEPER withdraws it. \nCU FLASH watching with horrified revulsion. \nBACK TO SCENE \nKEEPER carries the hissing snapping snake toward an enormous STUMP of a tree trunk. He holds his arm out over it, WHISTLES a curious note. The snake leaps off the arm and VANISHES into the hollowed out trunk. We notice now that there are SIX HOLES drilled into the gnarled wood. \nBARIN (CONT'D) Who dares the beast? \nA battle-scarred OLD TREE MAN steps forward. without a word, he goes to the stump and plunges a hand INTO one of the holes. \nINSIDE THE STUMP \nBIG CU SNAKE with a hiss, fangs strike a wrist. \nINT. LODGE - FEATURE OLD MAN (AURA, BARIN, FLASH, TREE MEN) \nWith eyes widening in horror, hs face starts to turn BLUE. He pulls out his hand and staggers backward. BARIN plunges his sword into the man's breast and he topples over the parapet, dead. Sword in hand, BARIN turns to FLASH. \nBARIN I did him a mercy. This venom brings death only after long tortured madness. Your turn, Earthling. \nCU FLASH \nFLASH I think I'll pass on this one. \nINCLUDE BARIN \nBARIN There are six openings to the serpent. Five are safe -- the sixth is death. Choose one -- or take your end from my sword here and now. \nFLASH \nHe swallows, Looks at the stump, at BARIN with his bloody sword, to the stump again, then at AURA. He crosses close and stares into her glittering eyes. \nFLASH Would you give Dale a message from me? Tell her I'm sorry how things have panned out -- I Loved her. \nAURA I'll do that. \nFLASH What the hell? Forget it. Sending that message by you is like sending a lettuce-leaf by a rabbit. \nBARIN'S sword touches FLASH'S back. \nHe walks to the stump. Every eye is on him, every breath held. \nWith a sudden quick motion, FLASH plunges his hand into a hole. He leaves it there a second, then whips it back out and wheels to BARIN. \nFLASH (CONT'D) Whew! -- Your turn, Prince Barin. \nSHOTS -- AROUND THE GROUP \nBARIN goes still. This is not what he had planned. AURA'S Tongue runs over her tee. \nAURA If your love for me is great enough, Barin, surely it will protect you from the serpent -- no? \nAURA laughs softly.

You oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself. \nBARIN If I were you, I'd choose the sword -- \nThe point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left.

Amazingly, he has hold of the terrible serpent, grasping it just below the head. CRIES from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO ACTION. \nWhirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the serpent's head at BARIN. \nBARIN slashes with his sword, misses. The serpent's tail coils around the blade, rips it from BARIN'S hand as the Prince of Arboria dives backwards. \nFLASH whirls again, SLAMS the serpent's head into a post, and SNATCHES the sword from the tail before it hits the floor. \nMOVING WITH FLASH \nHe dashes for the ramp to the ground.. The TIGER MAN is right in front of him, struggling in the net. FLASH pauses, SLASHES at the cords. TIGER MAN is freed, bounds to his feet with a ROAR, clobbers a pair of TREE MEN just jumping on him and FLASH. Snatching one's CROSSBOW and QUIVER OF GLASS ARROWS, he races down the ramp behind FLASH. \nBACK TO TOP LEVEL \nFEATURE BARIN \nPicking himself up, wheeling furiously on AURA, who has been watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement. \nBARIN (CONT'D) A mere toy of yours, eh? \nAURA (TAUNTING) Maybe I was wrong -- surely the Prince of Arboria wouldn't be beaten by a toy. \nBARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST. \nBARIN The hunt's on, my Tree Men! \nTREE MEN To the hunt with Barin! \nEXT.

He wheels, looks up, SEES FLASH. Letting out a fierce BIRDCALL. he jumps up and swings his own crossbow just as FLASH shoots. \nSWISH-PFFST as FLASH'S arrow hits him. ICE, he tumbles out of the basket. \nFLASH and TIGER MAN \nRun out along the branch, jump INTO the basket as it passes by. \nFLASH (CONT'D) How far will this take us? \nTIGER MAN I don't know --no man has ever been above the green. \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE TREES (BARIN, FLASH, TREE MAN, TIGER MAN, TREE MAN LEADER) \nBARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches, listening acutely. The one scouting in front calls back: \nTREE MAN The sight -- call came from the left! \nTREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left: \nBARIN Up and across we'll cut them off! \nHe BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines. \nIN THE BASKET \nFLASH and TIGER MAN \nRising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is changing, becoming less intensely green. \nTIGER MAN What is that color above? \nFLASH Blue. We call is blue. \n", "test2_id": 1651, "test3_input": "He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand- to-hand. \nThey wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting surface. It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman effort he flips BARIN over his back... over the edge! \nIn the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist. \nFLASH catches him. BARIN hangs suspended over the abyss of space held only by FLASH'S grip. \nVULTAN You've won, Earthling! Drop him to doom! \nFLASH (gasping at BARIN) Try to catch my wrist! -- the other one. \nVULTAN What is this?? \nZARKOV Call it what you want, Vultan -- compassion -- mercy: let us teach you the meaning of these words. \nFLASH (TO BARIN) Swing your body -- see if you can get a leg up here! \nSuddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky: \nMING'S VOICE Vultan! Hear Ming, Ruler of the Universe! \nINT. MING'S DOME (AURA, MING, MING'S VOICE, VULTAN, ZARKOV) \nWhere MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen, a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on: \nMING I see you, Vultan -- and Barin too! You both have defied we by sparing these Earthlings! \nAURA Barin -- my only -- I swear I didn't mean to get you into this! \nFEATURE VULTAN \nAs the VOICE goes on: \nMING'S VOICE Do you want to live, Vultan? \nVULTAN What creature wants to die? \nMING'S VOICE Then kill Flash Gordon now! Pick up Dale Arden, deliver her to me on your own wings -- it's your only chance! My fleet is already in the air, ready to destroy your whole Kingdom if you disobey! \nThe ECHO rolls and dies. \nDISC \nTIGER MAN suddenly leaps out onto the disc, slides over between the knives, helps FLASH pull BARIN up to safety. \nAS BEFORE \nZARKOV in his chains, walks over to the confused VULTAN... QUIETLY: \nZARKOV What'll you have -- death or dishonor? \nVULTAN looks down at FLASH once more, then makes up his mind. He shouts to his people: \nVULTAN We'll save these Earthlings! - Curse Ming! -- Into the air, my Hawkpeople - fly! \nZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN. He just looks at it. \nVULTAN (CONT'D) I don't understand this. I think I've gone mad. \nINT. MING'S DOME (AURA, MING) \nMING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA \nAURA Spare him Daddy -- oh please spare BARIN -- \n", "test3_true": "KLYTUS materialises from a shadow, smiling. \nMING You've always wanted her, Klytus -- Aura is yours. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT \nIt is being evacuated. Squadrons of HAWAKPEOPLE stream out of its many openings, diminutive figures against the sky. \nANOTHER PART OF THE SKY \nSeveral ROCKET-SHIPS appear, wonderfully gaudy contraptions with MING's battle-flags flying. A RAY shoots out from the nose of the biggest. \nEXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT \nThe RAY zaps it. The whole place EXPLODES. \nEXT. SQUADRON OF HAWKMEN - IN FLIGHT (DALE, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV) \nVULTAN and his CAPTAIN lead. Ranged around are BARIN, FLASH, DALE ,TIGER MAN and ZARKOV, each carried by a HAWKMAN. Distant explosions rumble like thunder. \nVULTAN Don't look back, Hawkman. Head for that cloud-cover! (over his shoulder) Where's this capsule of yours, exactly? \nZARKOV In the high grass east of Mingo. \nVULTAN Pick it up, Captain! \nThe CAPTAIN and a FEW HAWKMEN peel off. \nFLASH and DALE \nGaze at each other lovingly, flown along about a hundred feet apart. He calls for her: \nFLASH Guess the first thing you and me are gonna do after we land..! \nDALE Darling not in front of the Hawkmen -- you'll make me blush! -- \nFLASH Gonna do it first thing -- around here, never know if you'll get another chance! \nDark SHADOW falls over DALE. She looks up. \nANOTHER ANGLE IN THE SKY \nA big ROCKET SHIP hovers, doors in its bottom side opening. A flickering RAY shoots down. \nBACK TO THE HAWKMEN AND OTHERS IN SKY \nFEATURE DALE \nAs an effulgent GLOW envelopes her. Inexorably, DALE and her HAWKMEN are sucked upward. \nDALE Help!! \nFLASH I'm coming, Dale! (to his Hawkmen) Follow her -- climb! \nVULTAN's command of course takes precedence. The HAWKMAN bearing FLASH follows his mates into a shrieking vertical. dive. \nINT. ROCKET SHIP (DALE, HEDONIA) \nDALE and her HAWKMAN are sucked up into a chamber. Waiting SOLDIERS seize the struggling HAWKMAN, brutally smash his wings pitch him OUT the bottom as the doors close. \nDALE backs off, drops into a karate stance, With a WHINING ROAR the craft accelerates throwing DALE off balance against a wall.

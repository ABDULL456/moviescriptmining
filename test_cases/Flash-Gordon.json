FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward. \nINT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS (DALE, FLASH) \nThe TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals. DALE lurches in against the tornado. \nDALE Can you fly it? \nFLASH I can fly all right -- I've had a couple of lessons! -- just don't if I can land!

Just as he is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside. \nEXT. GREENHOUSE \nAmazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel, bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on rolling toward the greenhouse. \nAS ABOVE - FEATURE MUNSON \nSEEING the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting to run.

ZARKOV is there, smiling at them in a strange way. \nFLASH Hello. i'm Flash Gordon, this is Miss Dale Arden -- \nZARKOV (MEANS IT) Delighted to see you. \nFLASH This crazy storm knocked us down could we use a phone? \nZARKOV Certainly. Just follow me -- up those stairs. \nFLASH Some weather huh? \nZARKOV It will get worse. \nZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV with a funny expression. \nDALE You're Dr. Hans Zarkov! \nZARKOV hesitates just an instant, the nods. \nZARKOV How did you know? \nDALE I saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you left NASA, remember? It said you were utterly --- \nDALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue. \nZARKOV Insane?

It gives Ming pleasure. \nDALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly.

Think of me -- hard! \nINTERCUTS - FLASH AND DALE - SERAGLIO BATH AND COCKPIT \nAs they communicate. NOTE: There might be some faint glow in the air above the tub some spectral suggestion. of FLASH'S presence, the idea being to show that HEDONIA and other FEMALES are unaware of this interchange going on as they continue to bathe and groom DALE. \nINT.

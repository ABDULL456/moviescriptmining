{"test1_input": "12.EXT. CAR \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nThe car turns the corner and heads down a long driveway surrounded by trees. The car approaches a large imposing building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds. Outside a sign reads HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL. \nCUT TO: \n13.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad DAY \nLisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor. She has a file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously. A door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie steps out. He is well groomed and his eyes are warm and inviting. This is DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER. MIXTER Lisa Templeton? \nLisa stands abruptly, dropping her file in the process. \nLISA Me! Sorry- \nLisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of it. \nLISA Shit! \nMixter smiles. \nLISA Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that! \nMIXTER It's quite alright. I'm Doctor Elliot Mixter. Come into my office. \nLisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor and compose herself. Mixter holds the door open and Lisa enters the office. \nCUT TO: \n14.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa stands in the office. Mixter enters and shuts the door. \nMIXTER Please, take a seat. \nLisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk. Mixter walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair facing her. \nLISA I've uh... brought my resume and some references. I know I already sent a copy with my application but just in case. \nMIXTER Thank you. \nMixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk. He glances over it. \nMIXTER Very good. I see you've had lots of experience cleaning private homes. \nLISA Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of them. \nMIXTER Well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition. \nLISA Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've also worked cleaning a school, so I am used to big areas. \nMIXTER Yes I've seen that. When I say this is a different proposition I mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here. \nLISA Oh yes, yes of course. \n", "test1_true": "LISA I know what you mean, yes. \nMIXTER Would that bother you? \nLISA It may be strange at first but I actually have some experience in \nthat area. I would clean my mother when she lost control of her bodily functions during her illness. It's something I got used to very quickly. It became routine. \nMIXTER I see. How is your mother now? \nLISA Well... she passed away. \nMIXTER I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's important to me that every employee here, whether they are a psychiatrist, an orderly or a cleaner, needs to fully understand what our mission statement at this hospital is. \nLISA Okay. \nMIXTER High Hopes was only built two years ago and as an institution we have only been running for just over a year now. So we're still building our reputation. But I am very clear on what I want that reputation to be. I intend to make this institution one of the foremost centres for mental health treatment in the country. If you look into my history you'll know that I have a stellar reputation in the field of psychiatry and I want to use that to help others. That is why I have put my own money into the creation of this institution. We are only just starting out but we have a long term ambition to be considered the best. So what I require is that every person who works at this institution, in any capacity, must be professional and sensitive to the needs of the patients. Unlike other institutions, the welfare and care of our patients comes first here. \nLISA I really admire that and I promise I would not let you down if I was given this job. \nMIXTER I'm sure you wouldn't. \nLisa's face quickly contorts. Mixter looks puzzled. Suddenly Lisa sneezes. It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to cover her mouth and nose. She sneezes all over Mixter. Lisa looks horrified. \nLISA Oh my God, I'm so sorry!! \nLisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a Kleenex box on his desk. She frantically wipes the saliva and snot from his face. \nMIXTER It's quite alright, please sit down, I can take care of it. \nLisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When he's done he stares at Lisa. \nMIXTER Okay... well thanks for coming in. I'll let you know. \nLISA Look I'm so sorry, I really am! \nMIXTER It's fine. We'll be in touch. \nSuch is her embarrassment, Lisa can't get out of the office fast enough. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n15.INT. BEDROOM \u00ad LISA'S HOME - LONG ISLAND \u00ad NIGHT \nLisa is lying on her bed watching TV, flicking endlessly through the channels. The phone on the bedside table rings. Lisa picks up the receiver. \nLISA Hello? \nNANCY (O.S) Hey hun! \nLISA Hey Nancy. \n", "test1_id": 2253, "test2_input": "LISA I'm positive. \nDELANEY I better tell the orderlies. This is no place for a little girl to be. \nCUT TO: \n29.INT. WARD B \u00ad LATER Lisa is polishing a table. Delaney walks in with HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms. LISA Did you find her? \nDELANEY No. \nHARDCASTLE So you're the one who saw the little girl huh? \nLISA Yes. \nHARDCASTLE You sure you saw a little girl? \nLISA Of course. \nHARDCASTLE Well I've had to pull staff off other wards to search this goddamn place top to bottom. We found nothing. \nLISA That's strange. \nHARDCASTLE A big fucking inconvenience is what it is! Do me a favour, the next time you think you see something be absolutely sure before you go running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't got time to be running around this place looking for shit that isn't there! You understand?? \nLISA Yes. \nHardcastle exits. Lisa looks embarrassed. \nLISA Sorry. \nDELANEY Don't worry about it. Better safe than sorry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n30.INT.STAIRCASE \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL-NEXT NIGHT \nLisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and bucket. A clock on the wall reads 3:15am. \nCUT TO: \n31.INT. WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa walks into Ward X. She looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment. Overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping. \nAs she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle, a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell. \nSuddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit. \nCUT TO: \n32.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad NIGHT \nDelaney is sifting through a tool box. Lisa stands in the doorway. \n", "test2_true": "LISA What? \nDELANEY Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor Mixter's office? I've got to check the boiler, there's been complaints about the heating not working. \nLISA No problem. \nLisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf. \nCUT TO: \n33.EXT.MIXTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLisa knocks on the door. \nLISA Doctor Mixter? Hello? \nShe knocks again. No answer. Lisa tentatively turns the handle. The door slowly creaks open. The office is empty. Lisa walks in. \nCUT TO: \n34.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nShe looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the side of the desk. Lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up before replacing it with a new bag. With her task complete, Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. She looks around the office. There is a shelf full of psychology books and a filing cabinet. Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing cabinet and it opens. \nLisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one marked 'Patient X'. She reaches for it and suddenly a HAND grabs her shoulder! A startled Lisa turns around. An orderly in his thirties is stood in front of her. He is thin but muscular, with slicked back hair. This is PEMBERTON. \nPEMBERTON What the hell are you doing in here? \nLISA Uh... I was just emptying the garbage. \nPEMBERTON Funny, I don't remember Doctor Mixter keeping the garbage in the filing cabinet. \nLISA Look I... it was just open and I ... I dunno. \nPEMBERTON Well, y'know I'm gonna have to report this. \nLISA Oh please don't, I didn't see anything I just opened it. \nPemberton smiles. \nPEMBERTON Well new girl, it's hospital policy to report this kind of thing. \nLISA But I've only just got this job and I really need it. \nPemberton looks her up and down. \nPEMBERTON Perhaps we can come to some arrangement. \nLISA What do you mean? \nPEMBERTON Well, I'd be doing you a big favour if I kept this to myself. So perhaps you can do me a favour. \n", "test2_id": 2254, "test3_input": "LISA They say things to me through the doors. Horrible things! \nDELANEY I know, they've done it to me too. \nLISA But that woman Sadie, she says things she couldn't possibly know about me. \nDELANEY Like what? \nLisa checks herself. \nLISA I sound crazy don't I? \nDelaney smiles. \nDELANEY No. This place just gets under your skin sometimes. \nLISA I'm starting to wonder if I'm losing my mind. \nDELANEY Well it's not healthy to think too much about what those crazy son-of- a-bitches say. Believe me you don't want them inside your head. \nLISA It's hard to keep them out sometimes. \nDELANEY Listen, take a break from Ward X for a while. I'll go down there for the next week or so. \nLISA I'm really sorry about this, I didn't think it would effect me so much. \nDELANEY Don't worry, it gets to everyone at first. But the last thing I want is for you to dread coming to work. \nDelaney puts his hand on Lisa's shoulder in a comforting manner. \nLISA Thank you. I really appreciate that. \nDelaney smiles. \nDELANEY No problem. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n52.TIME LAPSE: Passage from night to day and back again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n53.INT. WARD X \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nContinual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around Ward X. Pemberton enters and walks over to Palmer' cell. He slides open the hatch. \nPEMBERTON What's with all the fucking racket Palmer? \nPALMER Sorry to bother you Mister Pemberton. But I wondered if it would be possible to get some medical attention? \nPalmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open. Blood pours from the wound. \nPEMBERTON Now how the hell did that happen? \n", "test3_true": "PALMER I believe it was this rather crude weapon that did the damage. \nPEMBERTON Jesus Christ Palmer! Now put the weapon on the floor and back away. \nPalmer obliges with a smile on his face. Pemberton unhooks a truncheon from his waist belt. \nPEMBERTON Put your hands on your fucking head and face the wall! Now!! Palmer willingly follows the instructions. Pemberton takes a set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell. PEMBERTON I'm coming in dipshit, one fucking move from you and I'll cave your fucking skull in! You understand?? \nPALMER As you wish Mister Pemberton. \nCUT TO: \n54.INT. PALMER'S CELL \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nPemberton walks in with the truncheon raised above his head. \nPEMBERTON Don't you fucking move!! \nA nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a pair of handcuffs. Palmer slowly starts to back into him. \nPEMBERTON I said don't fucking move! \nPalmer moves faster. Pemberton swings for him but Palmer ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall knocking him to the floor. Palmer aims a swift and savage stamp at Pemberton's head. His skull crushes against the cold hard floor. Blood spatters all over the white cell. \nPALMER I'm terribly sorry about this. \nPalmer reaches down, takes Pemberton's keys and exits the cell. \nCUT TO: \n55.EXT. WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nPalmer stands at the entrance to Kimble's cell. He selects the key marked with the corresponding cell number. Palmer puts it into the keyhole and opens the door. \nPALMER Good evening Mister Kimble \nCUT TO: \n56.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad SAME TIME \nHardcastle strolls down the hallway. \nCUT TO: \n57.INT.

Hardcastle rushes down the steps. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 2255}

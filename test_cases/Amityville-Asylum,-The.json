{"train": "THE AMITYVILLE ASYLUM \nWritten by \nAndrew Jones \nSHOOTING SCRIPT 27TH JULY 2012 \nAgainst BLACK SCREEN a TITLE CARD appears: \n\"The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?\" - Edgar Allan Poe \nTITLE CARD dissolves. \nFADE IN: \n1.EXT. 112 OCEAN AVENUE \u00ad AMITYVILLE \u00ad NIGHT \nWe slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning hours. \nTITLE CARD Appears: \nThursday, November 14, 1974. \nTITLE CARD Dissolves. \nStray house pets are the only signs of life as families and neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana, two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at us. \nA signpost in the front yard reads \"HIGH HOPES\", a testament to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there. \nCUT TO: \n2.INT. BASEMENT \u00ad 112 OCEAN AVENUE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nWe move slowly through the basement, past various crushed beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television that displays white static. \nThere is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his \nlips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap open. A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be INHUMAN: \nFIGURE Kill them. Kill them all. \nButch stands and takes the rifle. The figure retreats back into the shadows. \nCUT TO: \n3.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nThe house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the rifle grasped tightly in his hands. \nCUT TO: \n4.INT. MASTER BEDROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS \n12.EXT. CAR \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nThe car turns the corner and heads down a long driveway surrounded by trees. The car approaches a large imposing building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds. Outside a sign reads HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL. \nCUT TO: \n13.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad DAY \nLisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor. She has a file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously. A door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie steps out. He is well groomed and his eyes are warm and inviting. This is DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER. MIXTER Lisa Templeton? \nLisa stands abruptly, dropping her file in the process. \nLISA Me! Sorry- \nLisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of it. \nLISA Shit! \nMixter smiles. \nLISA Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that! \nMIXTER It's quite alright. I'm Doctor Elliot Mixter. Come into my office. \nLisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor and compose herself. Mixter holds the door open and Lisa enters the office. \nCUT TO: \n14.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa stands in the office. Mixter enters and shuts the door. \nMIXTER Please, take a seat. \nLisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk. Mixter walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair facing her. \nLISA I've uh... brought my resume and some references. I know I already sent a copy with my application but just in case. \nMIXTER Thank you. \nMixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk. He glances over it. \nMIXTER Very good. I see you've had lots of experience cleaning private homes. \nLISA Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of them. \nMIXTER Well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition. \nLISA Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've also worked cleaning a school, so I am used to big areas. \nMIXTER Yes I've seen that. When I say this is a different proposition I mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here. \nLISA Oh yes, yes of course. \nNANCY (O.S) How did it go today? \nLISA It was a total fucking disaster! \nNANCY (O.S) Oh I'm sure you're just being silly hun! Whenever I've gone for an interview I always come out thinking it's gone really badly. But I bet it went better than you think. \nLISA I sneezed on the head of the institution. \nNANCY (O.S) You what?? \nLISA I sneezed on him! It was one of those sneezes that just sneaks up on you, I didn't have time to cover my face. Before you know it he's covered in my snot! \nNANCY (O.S) Oh God I'm sorry hun. \nLong silence on the line. \nLISA Go on, go ahead. You know you want to! \nNANCY (O.S) [HYSTERIAL LAUGHTER] \nLISA Laugh it up, it's gonna be your last chance because I'm not going for any more job interviews! I'm done, I'm always so damn nervous and I just don't make a good first impression. \nNANCY (O.S) You should take my advice and show a little cleavage at these interviews! Trust me, you'd get the job then! \nLISA That's just not me Nance. I wouldn't know where to start with flirting or any of that. Christ, if I wore high heels to one of these interviews I'd probably trip over! I'm a clumsy dork! \nNANCY (O.S) So what are you thinking of doing? \nLISA I dunno. Thanks for not disputing that dork remark by the way. \nNANCY (O.S) [Laughs] Sorry, hun! \nLISA I guess I'll have to sign on welfare to make the rent. Long term, maybe I should go back to school. Get better qualified for something. \nNANCY (O.S) How come you don't do something with your writing? You could try and get something published. Or write a book or something? \nLISA I dunno, I just... it's like I just haven't been able to bring myself to write since ... you know... \nNANCY (O.S) I know. It's a clich\u00e9, but time really is a healer. I'm sure the passion you had for it will come back. \nLISA Maybe. \nNANCY (O.S) You wanna talk about it? \nLISA Not really. I just think I'm gonna get myself a nice big tub of ice cream from the freezer and watch some TV. \nNANCY (O.S) Comfort eating! \nLISA [Smiles] I know but if there's ever a good time for ice cream it's today! \nNANCY (O.S) Can't argue with that! Give me a call tomorrow, let's go for coffee soon yeah? \nLISA Sure. Night. \nMAN Can I help you? \nLISA Yeah, I'm here for an induction into the cleaning job. \nMAN You must be Lisa? \nLISA Yes, that's right. \nMAN Doctor Mixter said you would be coming. I'm Delaney, we'll be working together. \nLISA Oh great. \nDelaney climbs off the step ladder and shakes Lisa's hand. \nDELANEY We work nights so today we'll just show you around, okay? \nLISA Okay, thank you. \nDELANEY I'll clean this up and we'll get to it. \nCUT TO: \n19.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad LATER Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa are silhouetted in the doorway. Delaney pulls a string hanging near the door and a light comes on. The cupboard is packed with various cleaning products. DELANEY This is the storage cupboard. Everything you will need for each \ntask is here, each shelf is labelled. \nLISA Okay. \nDELANEY The most obvious task is hoovering. This is our hoover here, it's straight forward. You'll be surprised that although it's powerful it's very quiet, because we are working when everyone's in bed so obviously we don't want to wake them up! It has a Telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system. So a lot more powerful than you may be used to. \nLISA Okay. \nDELANEY The mop and bucket is here, we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so that's straight forward. But there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet. It needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping. It's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors. It's pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it! \nLISA OKAY \nDELANEY One of the worst parts of the job is we have to remove chewing gum from lots of surfaces. They don't just stick it underneath the tables, it ends up everywhere! \nLISA Gross! \nDELANEY Yes! I think a lot of the time it's the staff doing it, not the patients! But we have this GumCart, which is a bit complicated but it's easier than just scraping the gum. The steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure. It can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute. \nLISA Is it okay if I watch you use it a few times first so I know exactly what I'm doing? I don't want to end up burning myself or any furniture! \nDelaney smiles. \nDELANEY No problem. Now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have. This is a concrete cleaner, very toxic stuff, so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here, okay? \nLISA Okay. \nDELANEY This is for cleaning and descaling brick, stone and concrete and for metal de-rusting. For concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water. Brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set, then rinse it off. But for those stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use it neat! \nLISA Okay. \nThe girl walks away. \nCUT TO: \n27.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad NIGHT \nLisa is returning the mop and bucket to the storage cupboard. She knocks a bottle off the shelf and leans over to pick it up. \nPOV SHOT: Someone is approaching Lisa, edging closer and closer. A hand stretches out and touches her shoulder. Lisa JUMPS and SMACKS her head on the underside of the bottom shelf. \nLISA Fuck!! \nLisa turns around to see Delaney standing there. \nDELANEY Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. \nLISA It's okay. \nLisa rubs her head. \nDELANEY Are you okay? \nLISA Yeah, just hurt that's all! \nDELANEY Sorry. \nLISA I'll live. \nDELANEY Do you want to grab a coffee? \nLISA Sure. \nCUT TO: \n28.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad LATER \nDelaney and Lisa are sat on a bench in the hallway sipping coffee from plastic cups. \nDELANEY Did you change the bins in the Day Room? \nLISA Yeah. \nDELANEY Good. I've got a light bulb to change in Room Twelve upstairs soon. We're making good time. \nLISA Cool. It's funny, I never thought I'd get this job. The interview didn't go well! \nDELANEY Doctor Mixter told me you were the only person he interviewed for the job. \nLISA Really? \nDELANEY Yeah. I'm sure he felt you were right for the job and didn't need to interview anyone else. \nLISA Cool. \nLISA I'm positive. \nDELANEY I better tell the orderlies. This is no place for a little girl to be. \nCUT TO: \n29.INT. WARD B \u00ad LATER Lisa is polishing a table. Delaney walks in with HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms. LISA Did you find her? \nDELANEY No. \nHARDCASTLE So you're the one who saw the little girl huh? \nLISA Yes. \nHARDCASTLE You sure you saw a little girl? \nLISA Of course. \nHARDCASTLE Well I've had to pull staff off other wards to search this goddamn place top to bottom. We found nothing. \nLISA That's strange. \nHARDCASTLE A big fucking inconvenience is what it is! Do me a favour, the next time you think you see something be absolutely sure before you go running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't got time to be running around this place looking for shit that isn't there! You understand?? \nLISA Yes. \nHardcastle exits. Lisa looks embarrassed. \nLISA Sorry. \nDELANEY Don't worry about it. Better safe than sorry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n30.INT.STAIRCASE \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL-NEXT NIGHT \nLisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and bucket. A clock on the wall reads 3:15am. \nCUT TO: \n31.INT. WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa walks into Ward X. She looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment. Overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping. \nAs she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle, a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell. \nSuddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit. \nCUT TO: \n32.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad NIGHT \nDelaney is sifting through a tool box. Lisa stands in the doorway. \nLISA What kind of favour? \nPEMBERTON A blow job. \nLisa's face contorts with disgust. \nLISA You're disgusting! \nLisa tries to leave the room but Pemberton stands in her way. \nPEMBERTON Oh come on, I bet you'd love it. LISA Look, you better get out of my way or I'm going to report you for sexual harassment. \nPEMBERTON You've been working here for five minutes. You really think Doctor Mixter is gonna believe a fucking cleaner over a medical professional? \nDELANEY Pemberton! \nPemberton spins around. Delaney is stood in the door way. \nDELANEY Leave her alone. \nPemberton laughs. \nPEMBERTON She ain't no prisoner here! I was just talking, what's the problem? \nDELANEY No problem. Lisa, come with me, we've got a job up on Ward B. A grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room. Delaney glares at Pemberton for a moment before leaving the room. Pemberton smirks. \nCUT TO: \n35.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nDelaney catches up with Lisa, who is a little emotional. \nDELANEY You okay? \nLISA I'm fine. It was just a little bit intimidating, y'know? \nDELANEY Pemberton can be like that. He works nights with that other son- of-a-bitch Hardcastle. They like to throw their weight around. You'll get used to it. \nLISA People like that shouldn't be in charge of patients. \nDELANEY Let's get a coffee. \nLISA You sure love your break times! \nDelaney laughs. \nDELANEY I like to pace myself! Lisa smiles. \nCUT TO: \n36.TIME LAPSE: Passage from night to day and back again. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \n39.INT. WARD B \u00ad CONTINOUS \nLisa and Hardcastle walk into the day room. The room is empty. \nHARDCASTLE Where is this patient huh? \nLISA She was right there, in that chair. \nHARDCASTLE Who? \nLISA Missus Hardesty. \nHARDCASTLE Missus Hardesty? \nLISA Yeah. She even spoke to me! \nHardcastle bursts out laughing. \nHARDCASTLE Missus Hardesty was here and she spoke to you? \nLISA Yes! \nHARDCASTLE Just a second... \nHardcastle steps out into the hallway. A few moments later Hardcastle re-enters the day room with Pemberton. \nHARDCASTLE The new girl here says that Missus Hardesty was just sat in that chair. Says she even spoke to her. \nPemberton chuckles. \nLISA Look I know she's supposed to be catatonic but I swear she said something to me! \nPEMBERTON That's not the strange thing, sweetheart. \nLISA What do you mean? \nPEMBERTON Missus Hardesty died this morning. \nThe blood drains from Lisa's face. \nLISA But I could have sworn... \nHARDCASTLE Listen newbie, how about you just get on with the cleaning and stay off the crack pipe. Okay, honey bunny? Pemberton and Hardcastle both laugh and leave the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n40.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nLisa is sweeping in the hallway. She looks up and just catches a glimpse of someone turn the corner up ahead. \nLISA Hello? \nwall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER. LISA'S MOTHER Don't you grieve for me? \nLISA Of course I do. Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks. Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand. Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness, standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church: \nFIGURE Kill them. Kill them all. \nCUT TO: \n46.INT. BEDROOM \u00ad LISA'S HOME \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa's eyes OPEN and she sits bolt upright. She is pale and soaked with sweat. It takes her a few moments to compose herself and realise that it was just a nightmare. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n47.EXT. HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nThe rain lashes down outside the institution. \nCUT TO: \n48.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nLisa is walking with Delaney. \nDELANEY Okay, next thing is mopping the floor in Ward X. \nLISA Umm... could you do that? \nDELANEY Why? \nLISA I dunno... I just need a break. \nDELANEY Does Ward X frighten you? \nLISA A little. \nDELANEY That's normal, it frightens me sometimes. But I've got to go up to a patient's room in Ward A. Apparently they've had a little accident. Surely you wouldn't prefer to clean that up? \nLISA Well... maybe not. \nDELANEY I know Ward X is a scary place. But you'll get used to it. \nLISA I can hear them talking. It's kinda unnerving. \nDELANEY I know, I hear that too when I'm down there. But trust me, once you get used to it things will get easier. \nCUT TO: \n49.INT. WARD X \u00ad LATER \nThe door creaks open. Lisa looks nervous. She walks in with her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor. She begins mopping the floor. As she mops past Sadie's cell she hears a knock on the inside of the cell door. \nSADIE I can hear you out there. \nLISA They say things to me through the doors. Horrible things! \nDELANEY I know, they've done it to me too. \nLISA But that woman Sadie, she says things she couldn't possibly know about me. \nDELANEY Like what? \nLisa checks herself. \nLISA I sound crazy don't I? \nDelaney smiles. \nDELANEY No. This place just gets under your skin sometimes. \nLISA I'm starting to wonder if I'm losing my mind. \nDELANEY Well it's not healthy to think too much about what those crazy son-of- a-bitches say. Believe me you don't want them inside your head. \nLISA It's hard to keep them out sometimes. \nDELANEY Listen, take a break from Ward X for a while. I'll go down there for the next week or so. \nLISA I'm really sorry about this, I didn't think it would effect me so much. \nDELANEY Don't worry, it gets to everyone at first. But the last thing I want is for you to dread coming to work. \nDelaney puts his hand on Lisa's shoulder in a comforting manner. \nLISA Thank you. I really appreciate that. \nDelaney smiles. \nDELANEY No problem. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n52.TIME LAPSE: Passage from night to day and back again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n53.INT. WARD X \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nContinual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around Ward X. Pemberton enters and walks over to Palmer' cell. He slides open the hatch. \nPEMBERTON What's with all the fucking racket Palmer? \nPALMER Sorry to bother you Mister Pemberton. But I wondered if it would be possible to get some medical attention? \nPalmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open. Blood pours from the wound. \nPEMBERTON Now how the hell did that happen? \n58.INT. WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nHardcastle enters. He sees the door of Palmer' cell open and slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance. Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches Palmer' cell. Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on the floor in a pool of his own blood. \nHARDCASTLE Shit! \nA SCREAM emerges from the next cell. Hardcastle rushes over to Kimble's cell door. Five orderlies rush onto the Ward. HARDCASTLE We got a major code six over here! The orderlies rush to Hardcastle's side, truncheons at the ready. Hardcastle puts a key in the lock and prepares to open Kimble's cell. \nHARDCASTLE Stay alert! \nHardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door. They are met by the sight of KIMBLE's corpse positioned upright on the toilet. There is a hole in his head with part of his BRAIN seeping out. Palmer stands next to him, with blood on his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand. He smiles, blood covering his teeth. \nPALMER Good evening gentleman. I believe we will be one short at roll call tomorrow morning. Hardcastle and the orderlies charge Palmer. He doesn't resist as they viscously tackle him to the ground. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n59.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad LATER \nLisa is walking down the hallway. She hears a SCREAM emerge from one of the rooms. She puts her ear to the door and hears the SCREAM again. Lisa kneels down and peers through the keyhole. In a clinical white room Palmer is strapped down on a table. His face is severely cut and bruised but he is conscious. Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a fifth smears conductor on Palmer temples. \nORDERLY #1 Do we need to put the bit in his mouth? \nORDERLY #2 No. We're not giving him the methohexital either. \nThe orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head. He then turns the dial on the ECT device up to full power. Palmer SCREAMS as he violently convulses, salivating heavily from his mouth. Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he bites his own tongue off. Lisa is horrified as she watches the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure. \nPOV Shot: Someone is approaching Lisa as she crouches in front of the door. A hand reaches out and GRABS her by the hair,YANKING her to her feet. Lisa SCREAMS. She turns to see Hardcastle standing in front of her. He invades her personal space in an intimidating manner. \nHARDCASTLE What the fuck are you doing?? \nLISA I just heard something so I ... I was just curious. \nHARDCASTLE What are you seeing in there? \nLISA Oh nothing, I didn't see anything. \nHARDCASTLE You make sure it stays that way. That guy is a fucking menace and he deserves everything he gets. So you don't talk to Mixter or anyone else about anything you've seen in there. You understand? \nLISA I won't say anything. \nHARDCASTLE Good. Now don't you got some cleaning to do somewhere? \nLISA Of course. \nLisa walks down the hallway. Hardcastle's eyes burn into the back of her head. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n60.EXT. COFFEE SHOP \u00ad LONG ISLAND \u00ad DAY Lisa rushes towards the entrance. She's running late. \nCUT TO: \n61.INT. COFFEE SHOP \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nMICK Butch, I told you man, you can't get no shit on lay-away any more. Your credit's all used up. \nButch pulls a wad of money out of the paper bag. \nBUTCH You accept cash? \nMick smiles. \nMICK My man! Come on in. \nCUT TO: \n65.INT. LIVING ROOM \u00ad APARTMENT \u00ad A LITTLE LATER \nButch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin. On his right arm is a belt. He then loads the heroin into a syringe. Butch tightens the belt and taps his arm. He sinks the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into his blood stream. His eyes sink and he lies back onto the crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling. From a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards Butch. Suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears. \nVOICE #1 (O.S) It's kill or be killed. \nVOICE #2 (O.S) Why haven't you killed that pig? \nVOICE #3 (O.S) They are plotting against you. We have decided that you must take action. \nVOICE #4 (O.S) Kill them. Kill them all. \nCUT TO: \n66.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad 112 OCEAN AVENUE \u00ad DAY Butch puts his jacket on and prepares to open the front door. Suddenly a large hand GRABS the back of his jacket. Butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his father red with rage. \nRONALD SENIOR Nineteen thousand dollars boy! Nineteen thousand!! \nBUTCH What?? \nRONALD SENIOR You stole that fuckin' money from the auto dealership!! \nBUTCH What the fuck you talking about?? I was robbed!! Didn't Brigante tell you huh? Some fuckers car jacked me Pop. I told the police about it! \nRONALD SENIOR You expect me to believe that, boy? You think I'm fuckin' stupid?? \nBUTCH I ain't saying your stupid pop, I'm telling you the truth! I was robbed god-damn it! \nRonald Senior grabs Butch by the scruff of the neck and SLAMS him against the door. LOUISE DEFEO rushes in. \nLOUISE What the hell's going on?? \nRONALD SENIOR Our son's a fuckin' junkie thief, that's what's going on!! He robbed the fucking dealership!! \nBUTCH Don't listen to him Ma, I ain't done nothing!! \nRonald Senior and Butch fall to the floor and start grappling. \nLOUISE Stop it!! Stop it now!! Louise attempts to pull Ronald Senior off Butch. Her nails dig into her husband's neck and draw blood. An enraged Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap him. Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the hallway. Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still trying to slap him. \nRONALD SENIOR Why do you always have to get involved huh?? You've always been too soft on that boy!! \nLISA Do you know the history of this place? \nDELANEY There's not much history. We've only been open a couple of years. \nLISA No, I mean the history of the land. \nDELANEY You mean... what was on the land before the hospital? \nLISA Yeah. \nDELANEY I know a bit about that. \nLISA One Twelve Ocean Avenue. The Amityville haunted house. \nDELANEY Well I don't know that it was haunted. Lots of people think that's lies. I know about the kid that killed his family. That's true. \nLISA I didn't know about it until a friend told me. \nDELANEY Really? It's a famous case. \nLISA How come you never mentioned it? \nDELANEY You seem spooked already. I didn't want to make it worse. \nLISA Y'know why I'm spooked? \nDELANEY Because of the patients on Ward X. \nLISA It's not just that Delaney. I think this place is haunted. In fact, I'm sure of it. \nDELANEY You've seen something? \nLISA Remember I said I saw a little girl roaming the hallways here? I know who she is. She's one of the DeFeo children who were killed. You ever seen her? \nDELANEY No. \nLISA Honestly? \nDELANEY To be honest I don't believe in all that ghost stuff. \nLISA Well I wasn't a huge believer, but I know what I've seen. \nDELANEY I believe that you've seen something. Some people are more open to that kind of thing, y'know? But me? I'm closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff. \nLISA Extra terrestrial is aliens. \nDELANEY Whatever it's called, I don't know. \nLISA So what do you believe in? Do you believe in God? \nDELANEY Serious questions tonight. \nLISA I'm just curious. \nCUT TO: \n71.INT. LIBRARY \u00ad LATER \nLisa and Gloria are sat at a table in a secluded corner of the Library. Various books are spread out on the table. \nGLORIA So you wanted to know about the history of Amityville dating back to the Native Americans? \nLISA Yes that's right. I'm writing a college paper and I had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about Native Americans being killed on the land down on Oceans Avenue. \nGloria's demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious. \nGLORIA Well that area has quite a dark history. \nLISA You mean the DeFeo murders at One Twelve? \nGLORIA Yes. Terrible business that. Those young children. Breaks my heart to think about such a tragedy. \nLISA Yeah it's awful. \nGLORIA You know most of the town was very upset when they decided to build that mental institution on the land. That used to be a nice suburban neighbourhood, now there's this big eye sore there. We had a \nthousand names on a petition. But I guess that Doctor who runs the place has enough money to pay off the people in high places. \nLISA So what about the native Americans? Is that story about them being killed on that land true? \nGLORIA There's something on that here. \nGloria flips through one of the books. \nGLORIA Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In the 18th Century there existed a group of Native Americans in Amityville known as \"The Satchem Tribe\" led by Satchem Takapausha, the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem in Massachusetts to escape persecution by the Christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their Witchcraft practices. These practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people (The significance of Six being related to the biblical number of man and creation) in order to induce the spirit of their God, The Dark Master, who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers, giving them immortality. The hundred strong tribe settled in Amityville but were later chased off the land by local Christians. Satchem accused the Christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land. A war started and the Christians hired a hunter called John Underhill from Salem. At the site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue was later built in Amityville, Underhill killed all of the tribe. The Indians were buried in a mass grave on the site. Before he died Satchem vowed revenge. According to local legend, Chief Satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land. Various parapsychologists and mediums have \nclaimed that Satchem's vengeful spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners. Although such assertions are widely disputed. \nLISA So the legend has basis in historical fact? \nGLORIA Absolutely. \nCUT TO: \n72.INT. STAFF ROOM \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT \nLisa is sat with Delaney, both nursing a cup of coffee. \nLISA You told me the other night that you think evil is within us all. But do you think that people can be influenced by an evil that comes from outside of themselves? \nDELANEY Are you still thinking about this? \nLISA I guess I am yeah. \nDELANEY I worry that you're thinking too much. This place is getting to you. LISA There's something going on in this place. Something sinister. And I don't just mean the patients on Ward X. Have you not noticed that? \nDELANEY I've noticed some things. \nLISA Tell me!! \nSadie stares directly at Lisa with intense eyes. An unnaturally deep voice escapes her lips: \nSADIE Our time is at hand! \nLisa slides the hatch shut. She walks over to the last door on the left. Lisa slides the hatch open and peers in. The resident John Doe sits in the shadows. Suddenly he sits forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face. Lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the internet article staring at her. The face of RONALD \"BUTCH\" DEFEO JUNIOUR. Lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the hallway, her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate. \nCUT TO: \n76.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad LATER \nLisa knocks on the door to Doctor's Mixter's office. \nMIXTER (O.S) Come in. \nLisa pops her head inside. \nLISA Doctor Mixter. \nMIXTER Oh Lisa, Hello. What brings you here? \nLISA I just wondered if I could speak to you for a moment sir. It's very important. \nMIXTER Of course, come in. \nCUT TO: \n77.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa enters and sits down opposite Mixter, who is sat behind his desk filling out a form. \nMIXTER What can I do for you Lisa? \nLISA Well... what I'm going to tell you will sound really strange but I need to tell you. \nMIXTER Okay, go ahead. \nLISA Do you know the history of the land the hospital is built on? \nMIXTER What are you referring to exactly? \nLISA Well, first of all. The DeFeo murders and the infamous house that people said was haunted. \nMIXTER I am aware of the DeFeo murders yes. The hauntings... well I think it's common perception now that a lot of that was exaggerated by the media. \nLISA Maybe. Are you aware of the history of the land dating back to the eighteenth century? \nMIXTER No, I can't say that I am. \nLISA There were a group of Native Americans in Amityville known as \"The Satchem Tribe\". They were massacred by Christians after a dispute over the land. \nMIXTER Okay. I'm sure there's a point to all this? \nLISA Let me out of here you sick fuck!! \nMIXTER Now Lisa, let's talk calmly or you will be sedated again. \nMixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed. \nLISA Why are you doing this? \nMIXTER You're having paranoid delusions. I'm also aware that you've been having disturbing visions. \nLISA I'm not having delusions, I know what I've seen! \nMIXTER Well you think you know. The human brain is a powerful thing and I'm sure you do believe what you've seen. But it's all in your mind Lisa, it's not reality. You're a very sick girl and you need treatment. \nLISA You do this to all your staff huh? The minute we speak out we get fucking committed?? \nMIXTER Staff? You were never staff here Lisa. You're a patient here. You've always been a patient here. \nLisa appears confused. \nLISA No, no. You're lying to me, I know who I am! I KNOW WHO I AM!! MIXTER I'm afraid not my dear. You've always been with us here. Initially as an out patient but now the delusions have progressed I feel it's time for you to become a full time resident. \nLisa becomes upset. Tears stream down her face. \nLISA But... but... \nMIXTER Look, I understand it's a lot to process now. I'll leave you to think about it and then we'll begin counselling sessions tomorrow. \nLISA Okay. \nLisa sobs. \nMIXTER Listen, how about I take this straight jacket off so you're more comfortable? \nLISA Thank you. \nMIXTER First you must take this. It will help you sleep. \nMixter hands Lisa a red pill and a bottle of water. She takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp of water. \nMIXTER Good girl. I know it's a lot to take in but together we'll get through this. Now I'm going to take your restraint off. Remember though, if you're violent then I promise you it will go straight back on. Okay? \nLISA Okay. \nMixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it off. \nMIXTER That better? \nLISA Yes. Thank you. \nMIXTER No problem. I'm going to leave you get some rest now. Tomorrow we start the healing process. \nMixter exits. The echo of the steel door closing reverberates around the tiny cell. We hear Mixter's footsteps as he walks down the hallway. Lisa's upset demeanour disappears immediately. She spits the red pill into the palm of her hand. \nCUT TO: \n94.INT.STAFF ROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS Lisa enters a small staff room. She SLAMS the door behind her. She clicks the lock. Lisa steps back from the door. She JUMPS as Patient X POUNDS on the door from the other side. Lisa looks around for a weapon. She limps toward the cutlery drawer below a sink. She rustles inside and finds a large butcher knife. Suddenly the door EXPLODES, a large hole blown through the middle of it by the GUN SHOT. Patient X reaches through, groping for the lock. Lisa reaches a large window in the room. She tries to lift the window. After an unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window is nailed down. LISA Fuck!! \nPatient X reaches for the lock. Lisa dashes to the storage cupboard and ducks inside. \nCUT TO: \n95.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark interior. Lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the knife held upwards. Everything is quiet. Suddenly the door SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it. The door cracks as Patient X SMASHES against it. Lisa crouches down with the knife at the ready. \nThe gun BLOWS a HOLE right through the door. Patient X leans through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the floor. He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to fire. Lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with all her might. The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye. He SCREAMS and drops the gun in the cupboard before stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa grabs the gun and stands up. Patient X looks at her with his remaining eye. Lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the door. \nLISA Lights out, you son-of-a-bitch!! BANG! The shot gun BLASTS a hole through Patient X's chest, blood splatters over Lisa. Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises. She is dressed in a clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds. Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet. His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a blinding WHITE LIGHT. They disappear and the light slowly dissipates. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n96.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL - LATER \nLisa, covered in blood, walks through the hallway with the rifle by her side. She reaches the door to Doctor Mixter's office and kicks it open. Mixter is sat behind his desk, now dressed in his usual shirt and tie. Lisa aims the gun at Mixter whose hands are beneath the table. LISA Get your fucking hands up you sick fuck! \nINSERT SHOT: Mixter presses a red button beneath the desk. \nMixter raises his hands. \nMIXTER I see we've dispensed with the usual pleasantries. Come in Lisa. \nLisa enters, kicking the door shut behind her. \nCUT TO: \n97.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nMixter is very calm. Lisa is trembling, the rifle visibly shaking in her hands as she aims it at Mixter's head. \nLISA You gonna tell me it's all in my head now huh?? Wanna tell me I'm the crazy one?? \nMIXTER Well maybe it is, maybe it isn't. How would you know? \nLISA Get the fuck out of my head you son-of-a-bitch! I know who I am and I know what I've seen! You're part of all of this. I know you are! You're the crazy one!! \nMIXTER You're the one holding the gun on a well respected doctor, my dear. \nLISA Why did you do this? Why?? \nMIXTER You are part of a great becoming tonight. A rising of The Dark Master who blesses all of his followers with power and immortality. \nLISA You fucking believe that do you?? Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me! You're no better than those fucking fundamentalists who kill innocent people because they've twisted shit they've read in some Holy book. It's all shit!! \nMIXTER The plan for the becoming is almost complete. Just one more sacrifice, that's all we need tonight. \nLISA How about if I blow your fucking head off then huh?? \n", "test1_input": "LISA Sounds ominous. \nDELANEY You could say that. It's where Category A patients are held. The criminally insane. \nLISA Really? Doctor Mixter didn't mention that. \nDELANEY Yes, well, these patients are beyond help so they've become athe hospital's secret. Many of them were transferred from prisons and other institutions. Doctor Mixter probably thought he could help them. He can't. The staff call this place Blood Row. \nDelaney opens the door. \nCUT TO: \n22.INT. STAIRCASE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase. As they descend down the steps, the light fades. \nCUT TO: \n23.INT. WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nDelaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of thick metal doors either side. Two light bulbs hang from the ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal illumination. Lisa's nose twitches. \nLISA What's that smell? \nDELANEY It always hangs in the air. No matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death. \nLisa looks concerned. \nLISA These patients are dangerous? \nDELANEY Yes. But don't worry, we never have to interact directly or anything like that. You will just be mopping the corridor and dusting. \nDelaney walks over to the first door on the right. There is a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic, white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth. He has wild hair and a scraggly beard. \nDELANEY That's Jerry Kimble. He was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty-nine times in front of her two year-old son, then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four-year-old daughter. They call him the Green Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here. He doesn't make any noise or fuss, but he is a dangerous man. Especially towards women. This next inmate is even worse. Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside. Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch shut. DELANEY That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as The Long Island Cannibal. He was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists. He'd track them down and torture them. He would eat parts of their body while they were still alive. \nLISA That's horrible. \nDELANEY The most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero. \nDelaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the hallway. He slides open the hatch. \nDELANEY Sadie Krenwinkel. \nLisa looks inside. Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up and smiles at Lisa. Delaney slides the hatch shut. \nLISA What's her deal? \nDELANEY She was a member of a Witchcraft cult. They kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual. Five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult. She turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court. She's been around a few institutions since. Now she's here. \nLISA Some strange stories here. \nDELANEY Well those aren't the strangest. \n", "test1_true": "amnesia. Often we find out who they are. Not so with this man. \nLISA Why is he down here? \nDELANEY They first brought him in about six months ago. No one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night. An orderly found him wandering the grounds. First of all he was like Missus Hardesty upstairs-catatonic. Then a few weeks later he started to respond to Doctor Mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures. But soon, he got violent. Very violent. He'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients. One day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed. A young doctor tried to take his vital signs. Patient X here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx. It took six orderlies to restrain him. Now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise. We still don't know who he is. \nLISA Oh God. \nDelaney stares at Lisa. \nDELANEY God has nothing to do with this man. Delaney slams the hatch shut. Lisa looks disturbed. \nDELANEY I haven't put you off have I? \nLISA I guess not... it's just a lot to take in. I've obviously never been around stuff like this before. \nDELANEY This is the reality of this place. We don't deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess. If you can't handle \nthat then I understand. You know that it's not too late to back out? \nLisa considers for a moment. \nLISA I'm not a quitter. \nCUT TO: \n24.EXT. HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL \u00ad NIGHT The hospital is bathed in moonlight. \nCUT TO: \n25.INT. WARD B \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room. She then empties the bins. A Clock on the wall ticks towards 3:15am. \nCUT TO: \n26.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad A LITTLE LATER \nLisa is mopping. As she reaches the end of the hallway a young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear. Lisa is STARTLED. LISA Ooh, you made me jump! Should you be out of bed this late? \nGIRL I don't know. \nThe girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face, yet there is a haunting sadness in her eyes. \nLISA I don't think you should be. \nGIRL Do you want to play with me? \nLISA I'd love to sweetheart, but it's very late now. I think you better go back to bed. \nGIRL Okay. \n", "test2_input": "LISA Yeah? \nNANCY Well, y'know they only built that Asylum a couple of years ago? \nLISA Yeah. \nNANCY He says it was built on the site of One Twelve Ocean Avenue. \nLISA What's that? \nNANCY You never heard of it? \nLISA No. \nNANCY It was a famous house. Or should I say infamous. Some guy shot his whole family there back in the seventies. Parents, brothers, sisters. Wiped out his entire family with a shotgun. Then the next owners of the house only lasted there about a month. They said they were driven from the house by evil spirits. The house became known around the world. That's why the recent owners sold the land, they had enough of all the media interest and constant tourists. Have you seriously never heard of the Amityville horror house? \nLISA I vaguely remember hearing some stuff a while ago, but I never really took it in. I honestly didn't realise that the hospital was on the same land. \nNANCY Yup, right on the spot where the house was demolished. You really think the place is haunted? \nLISA Either that or I'm going crazy. \nNANCY Well you're not crazy, hun. Perhaps the stories about hauntings at the house were true. Maybe the house is gone but the spirits stuck around. \nLISA You believe in ghosts? \nNANCY I dunno, never seen one. But I like to think I'm open minded. Plus you're the most intelligent girl I know. If you say you've seen something, I believe you. \nLisa smiles. \nLISA Thanks Nanc. \nNANCY So what are you gonna do? Are you gonna quit? \nLISA Part of me says I should. There's a lot about the place that frightens me. But I dunno... I think I've seen too much to be able to just walk away and forget the place. \nNANCY If I was you I'd just walk away. Who wants to work at a place that frightens them? \nLISA Well I need the money for starters. But now it feels like I need to find out more. \nNANCY Maybe you are crazy after all! \nCUT TO: \n62.INT. BEDROOM \u00ad LISA'S HOME \u00ad DAY Lisa is sitting on her bed studying a laptop. On screen she IS READING: \n\"Ronald Joseph \"Butch\" DeFeo, Jr. is an American mass murderer. He was tried and convicted for the 1974 killings of his father, mother, two brothers and two sisters.\" \nWe slowly push in on Lisa's eyes and then: \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \n63.EXT. 112 OCEAN AVENUE \u00ad DAY \u00ad 1974 \n", "test2_true": "TITLE CARD appears: \nNovember 1974. \nTITLE CARD dissolves. \nRONALD \"BUTCH\" DEFEO JUNIOR approaches him. \nBUTCH Hey Pop. \nRONALD SENIOR You come to help? \nBUTCH I'm going out. \nRONALD SENIOR Again?

RONALD SENIOR What of it? \nBUTCH Well how come you're spending five hundred bucks on Mark and I gotta come beg you for money all the time huh? \nRONALD SENIOR What's the matter with you, boy? Your brother's broken his leg, he needs that wheelchair. \nBUTCH Well I need money too! \nRONALD SENIOR Butch, you get a wage from the auto dealership every Friday and it's gone by Monday. Why is that? \nBUTCH I gotta live. \nRONALD SENIOR What you spending that money on huh? Cos it ain't rent or food. You get everything you want for nothing 'round here. I know what you're really doing with that money. \nBUTCH You don't know shit! \nRONALD SENIOR Boy, you better shut that mouth of yours. \nRonald Senior stands there, axe in hand, eye-balling his son. \nBUTCH This ain't over. \nButch storms back towards the house. Ronald Senior brings the axe forcefully down on a piece of wood, splitting it cleanly in half. \nCUT TO: \n64.INT. APARTMENT \u00ad AMITYVILLE \u00ad DAY \u00ad \nThere is a knock on the door. A pale looking man in his twenties opens the door to reveal Butch standing in the door way holding a brown paper bag. \nBUTCH Hey Mick. \n", "test3_input": "CUT TO: \n86.INT. WARD B \u00ad SAME TIME \nDelaney and Lisa run through the Ward. They turn a corner and are suddenly confronted by a large group of patients in white gowns. \nLISA Fuck!! \nDelaney and Lisa run back the other way and turn the corner. Two orderlies, brandishing truncheons, are approaching. \nLISA Please help us! \nDELANEY The patients are loose! \nORDERLY #1 We'll take care of them. \nThe orderlies turn the corner and see the large group. The orderlies look at each other, fear in their eyes. They turn to run but the patients overpower them in a flash, grabbing and scratching, deep wounds tearing into their skin. Delaney and Lisa look on as the helpless orderlies SCREAM. \nLISA Shouldn't we help them?? \nDELANEY We need to save ourselves. Let them reap what they've sewn. \nDelaney grabs Lisa and they run down the hallway, as the patients beat the orderlies with their own truncheons. \nCUT TO: \n87.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa and Delaney rush down the hallway. They turn a corner and are stopped in their tracks by the GHOST of ALLISON DEFEO stood in the centre of the hallway clutching a teddy bear. She has a HUGE bullet hole in the centre of her forehead, blood dripping down her face. \nALLISON Why don't you want to play with me? CRASH! A door at the other end of the hallway is kicked open. Patient X bursts through and aims the rifle. Lisa and Delaney rush back down the hallway. A BULLET HITS the wall just as they turn into an open doorway. \nCUT TO: \n88.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa and Delaney are running through the hallway. They burst through a door. \nCUT TO: \n89.INT. SHOWER ROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nLisa and Delaney find themselves in the shower room. Mould covers the walls and all of the showers are on, gushing dirty water. They spot another door on the other side of the \nshower room but blocking their path to it is a thin middle aged man in a white vest and white shorts, facing the wall. He is whispering to himself. Lisa and Delaney stop. LISA Hey mister, you need to get the hell out of here, there's a patient going crazy with a gun!! \nThe man turns around. His face is weathered and his eyes are wild and bloodshot. \nMAN My...my skin's on too tight! \nDELANEY What? \nMAN My skin is on too tight! \n", "test3_true": "MAN My skin's on too tight!! \nThe man reaches into the pocket of his shorts and produces a scalpel. \nMAN My skin is on too tight!! \nThe man STABS his cheek with the scalpel. Lisa SCREAMS! The man drags the scalpel around his face in one continuous motion, blood seeping from the circular gash. As Lisa and Delaney watch on in horror the man RIPS the skin off his face, exposing muscles and veins. His white vest and shorts are now saturated with blood. The man sighs with relief. \nMAN That's much better. \nA horrified Lisa and Delaney rush towards the door and BURST through it. \nCUT TO: \n90.INT.

He checks the lock and realises that a key has been snapped off in it. \nDELANEY Kurwa!! \nLISA What, what?? \nDELANEY A fucking key's been snapped in the lock! Delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair. He rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the chair. BANG! A bullet tears through his back and exits through his chest with an explosion of blood. Lisa SCREAMS! Delaney drops to his knees and Lisa rushes to his side. Patient X loads fresh cartridges in the rifle. Delaney is DEAD. Lisa runs down the hallway. Patient X takes aim.

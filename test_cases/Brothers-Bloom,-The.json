A car chugs over the horizon. \nNARRATOR As far as con man stories go, I think I've heard them all. Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers, tales drawn long and tall. But if one bears a bookmark in the confidence man's tome, twould be that of Penelope, and of the brothers Bloom. \n2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2 \nThe car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a country house. \nBoth in black.   Each with a suitcase. \nNARRATOR At ten and thirteen Bloom and Stephen (the younger and the old) \n3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3 \nThe two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating breakfast. \nNARRATOR had been through several foster families. \nThe FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the crap out of him. \nNARRATOR (cont'd) Thirty eight, all told. \n4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4 \nCLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER \n\"Bloom\" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip by. Under the \"REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS\" field we catch different entries: \"BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE\", \"UNMANAGEABLE\", \"MOLESTED CAT\", \"SOLD OUR FURNITURE\", \"CAUSED FLOODING\". \n4   CONTINUED:                                                  4 \nNARRATOR Mischief moved them on in life, and moving kept them close. \n5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5 \nThe brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand. \nNARRATOR For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen Bloom, and both had more than most. \nThe front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the brothers suspiciously. \n6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6 \nA wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey. \nNARRATOR Another home, another main street. Stephen looked around, then summed the burgh up thusly: \nSTEPHEN Bloom, we've hit a one hat town. \nNARRATOR One theater. One car wash. One cafe. One park. One cat. Which, through some mishap, had one leg. \nThe cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street with its one leg. \nSTEPHEN Sweet Jesus. Look at that. \n7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7 \nA group of children flee the school joyfully. \nNARRATOR One school, which meant one tight- knit group of local well-off kids. \n8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8 \nThe children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket Pops. \nNARRATOR Their pocket-change bought rocket pops, \n9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9 \nThe brothers at the counter.

All well loved, rooted, happy as you please. \nBloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too happy nursing their Pixie Stix. \nNARRATOR (cont'd) Always there. In every town. \nStephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette. \nSTEPHEN The playground bourgeoisies. \n20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20 \nBack in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks homeward in the warm twilight. \n21   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            21 \nBOX #8 - \"Stephen scouts church\" dissolves to: Stephen's eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE. \n22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22 \nBloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to: \nBox #10 - \"Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the coolers\" \nStephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler. \nSTEPHEN Oh - kay. How's it going on the playground front? \nBLOOM It's great. \nSTEPHEN So, on to step eleven, then.   The Tale. You tell them - \nBLOOM Wait... \nBloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted. \nNARRATOR Must the numbers rattle on?    Must the fiction end? \nBLOOM I think I need more time to win their- \nSTEPHEN Bloom. They're not your friends. They're part of this, and this aint real. Remember, it's a con. And when it's done, we've just got us. And we'll be moving on. (beat) So, the tale. You tell them there's a \n23   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           23 \nBloom holds court with the kids. \nBLOOM hermit in the woods. A one eyed, steel toothed vagabond... \n24   INT. ATTIC                                                24 \nBack to Bloom and Stephen in the attic \nBLOOM ...with blood red eyes? \nSTEPHEN (nods) That's good. He stopped you coming home from school... \n25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25 \nBLOOM ...and told me of a cave. \nGIRL What kind of cave? \nBLOOM A cave of wonders. \nBOY Pffft ha. \nGIRL Shut up, Dave. \nBLOOM At noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball of light, which flutters like a butterfly... \nGIRL A will-o-whisp? \nBLOOM That's right. It guides you \n26   INT. ATTIC                                                26 \nSTEPHEN ...if you can keep up... \n27   EXT. PARK                                                 27 \nBLOOM ...to where the treasures lay. \nBOY So where's this cave? \nGIRL Yeah, where? \n28   INT. ATTIC                                                28 \nSTEPHEN Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say. He got this greedy glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech... and said he'd tell for thirty bucks. \nSomething in Bloom's face falls. \n29   EXT. PARK                                                 29 \nThe girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet. \nEXCITED BOY Well that's just two bucks each! \nThe kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the girl's joyful gaze. \nNARRATOR So Sunday came... \n30   EXT. WOODS                                                30 \nChildren in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark woods, led by Bloom. \n30   CONTINUED:                                                  30 \nNARRATOR (cont'd) `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent' percentage deal. \n37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37 \nThrough a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy Sunday clothes hang, each tagged. \nNARRATOR `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry clean shop. \nAnd striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute. \n38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38 \nBloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside him. \nSTEPHEN So how's it feel? \nBloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in the distance. \nNARRATOR In truth, young Bloom won't know for twenty years just how he felt. \nHONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The brothers pick themselves up. \nNARRATOR (cont'd) And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story. \nStephen tosses his Rocket Pop. \nSTEPHEN Let `em melt. \nThe con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand, strides down the alleyway. \nStephen in front. \n38   CONTINUED:                                                 38 \nBloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at the children playing in the sun. \nCUT TO: \n39   OPENING CREDITS                                              39 \nCUT TO: \n40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40 \nFlames spread over a wall of bookshelves. \nTITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER \nA YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of the flaming books. \nYOUNG MAN He gets the scarab, you get the money, I get the girl... so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants. \nThree gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the young man folds to the ground. \nA sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while behind him the rest of the library roars in flames. \nVOICE (O.S.) Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god are you... oh god he's dead, Victor's dead... you've killed us! We had it he was right it was all in the bag and now we're dead, why? Why, you stupid son of a bitch? \nThe owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston hard. \n40   CONTINUED:                                                 40 \nCHARLESTON Cause the Turk was right. After seeing her, after that night on the airstrip, after Cairo everything changed, and he couldn't see the play through that one milky eye, but the Turk was right about one thing, that there's nothing beautiful about money. She's beautiful. \nMCGUIRE This isn't happening... \nCHARLESTON He'll never have her now. She's free. And I'll never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it's worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that she's free. \nMCGUIRE Charleston. I can't be here... \nCHARLESTON You're not here. Neither of us are. It's Mowcher's gun. \nMCGUIRE Mowcher is at the bottom of the Spree with a cowl in his neck! \nCharleston gets to his feet. \nCHARLESTON They won't find him for a week, and the Albino will chalk it up to Davey, he won't talk. We're clean. \nMCGUIRE Listen to you - four months ago you were an investment banker! Now you're nothing. The Scarab's lost. The money's gone. It'll rot in the Peruvian earth. It's gone. \nCharleston limps to the flaming doorway. \n40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40 \nCHARLESTON The man named Charleston you met nine months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead. If we see each other again it'll be as strangers. As for the money... let it rot. \nHe exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires squealing. \nThen through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN, early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod. \nMCGUIRE Wow. \nHe pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none. \nMCGUIRE (cont'd) Wow is the word you're both looking for. Wow. \nThe Asian woman nods slightly. \nStephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink. \nShe flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the bullet bouncing off her. \nTHE TURK Where is Bloom? \nIn the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck with a queen of hearts he can't play. \nA beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains. \nROSE There you are. Hiding? \nBLOOM Yeah. \nROSE I've been learning.      Stephen likes to talk about you. \nBLOOM Did he tell you the cave story? \n44   CONTINUED: (3)                                            44 \nROSE Is it true? \nBLOOM What else did he tell you? \nROSE I'm not going to tell it as good as Stephen. You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in St. Petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the Diamond Dog. And he was your Fagin and Stephen was his Artful Dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly. \nBLOOM Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier. \nROSE Why did he do that? \nBLOOM And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. Sounds romantic. \nROSE It does. \nShe pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a kiss. \nBloom's eyes stay open. \nBLOOM You want to know how Stephen did it? With Charleston? \nROSE It's not the first thing on my mind. \n45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45 \nA replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf. \nBLOOM (O.S.) He positioned me in the same spot where, seven years ago, Charleston's wife stood and told him she was leaving. \nThe room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place. \nBLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) He chose my outfit to mirror her suit. \nSure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the Wife's outfit. \nBLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) He even phonetically matched my final words to hers. \nWIFE This is the end. Charelston, you've always been a dunce. \nEverything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room. \nBLOOM (IN FLASHBACK) So in the end, everyone gets everything he wants. \nBANG. \n46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46 \nBLOOM That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And that's why you think you want to kiss me. It's a con. \nHe leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar towards the exit, passing Stephen. \n46   CONTINUED:                                                     46 \nBLOOM (cont'd) I need air. \nSTEPHEN Who doesn't? (plays a card) That's the big 2. \n47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47 \nBloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square. \nBloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt bright red with fake blood, face long as hell. \nPutting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face. \nHe then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom. \nAs soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile. \nStephen paces out into the street. \nSTEPHEN We missed the sunrise.    That would've been nice. \nThey walk across the street to the Tiergarten. \n48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48 \nBerlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom trailing behind, lost in thought. \nOn a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips' owner heads for the apartment door. \n51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51 \nStephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment. \nA goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom. \nBloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip. \nA rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian. \nSTEPHEN She's right, you know. \nBLOOM Why are you here, Stephen? \nSTEPHEN Put on your face, let's eat. \n52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52 \nStephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the cheek and sends them off. \n53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53 \nA few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside. The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares. \nBLOOM How'd you find me? \n53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 \nSTEPHEN The Chink. \nBLOOM How'd the Chink find me? \nStephen's eyes:       \"Are you joking?\" \nSTEPHEN How've you been? \nBLOOM Great. \nSTEPHEN I've done a lot of thinking the past three months. You don't want out. You think you do but you don't. Here, c'mere. I want to show you something. \nBLOOM I'm quits, Stephen. \nStephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Where are we going? \nSTEPHEN New Jersey. \nBLOOM (sighs) Well lemme get my jacket. \nCUT TO: \n54   EXT. AN AIRPLANE ROARS RIGHT TO LEFT                              54 \nCUT TO: \n55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55 \nA long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road. \nBLOOM Looks like an etching from a Bronte novel. \n55   CONTINUED:                                                 55 \nStephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to a plaster deer in the front yard. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Huh. Look at that. Well thanks. I'm gonna head back to Italy. \nSTEPHEN Big money. Inheritance. Dad died early, Mom died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that I can't pronounce. \nBLOOM How much? \nThe Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Jesus. \nSTEPHEN Look out. \nStephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke. \nThumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a non-Lamborghini way. \nBloom watches her through the trees, none too happy. \n56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56 \nOff to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their rental car, an old school Cadillac. \nIn the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one. \nBLOOM What am I doing here, Stephen? I have one rule, and you've never even tested it. \n56   CONTINUED:                                                     56 \nSTEPHEN Stick with me. \nBLOOM It's gotta warp the image though, right? \n66   CONTINUED: (2)                                            66 \nPENELOPE No, yeah it does. That's what - the Taj Majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point- and-shoot camera can be the flattest, dullest, \"here's us at the Taj Majal,\" \"Oh lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses\" picture. But you can look at the most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light, it's warped and peculiar and imperfect. It's not reproduction, it's storytelling. \nBLOOM It's a lie that tells the truth. \nPENELOPE I dunno about truth. A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you, the less you know. \nBLOOM What's changed between now and twenty minutes ago? Cause this is kinda like a conversation. \nPENELOPE Huh.    Well shit. \n67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67 \nBloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway. \nBLOOM Well, I should, uh, it's late. So. I meet a lot of people in my job I have to professionally act interested in. It's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone. \nPENELOPE Are you leaving? \nBLOOM Yeah. \n67   CONTINUED:                                                  67 \nPENELOPE Are you coming back? \nBLOOM Well next time I'm in town. We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months. \nDuring this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin. \nPenelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush crosses her still face. \nWhen Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Paris and Greece, I think. I've gotta get a hat. Thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration. And for the good conversation. Goodbye Penelope. \nPENELOPE Goodbye Bloom. \nHe drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go. \n68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68 \nA jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles. \nBLOOM I need another day with her. \nSTEPHEN You'll have two weeks on the boat. \nBLOOM I need another day to get her on the boat, she isn't hooked. That bit I skipped where we were talking in the backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we didn't really talk. \n68   CONTINUED:                                                      68 \nSTEPHEN It isn't the talking that hooked her. \nBloom turns from the road. \nBLOOM I think you're wrong. \nA screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look. \nBLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd) Though every time I say that, you end up being comically right. That's her, isn't it? Yeah. \nPenelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon. \nBloom meets her. \nPENELOPE Hey. \nBLOOM Hi.    What are you doing here? \nShe holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band. \nPENELOPE You left this money in my kitchen. \nHe doesn't take it. \nBLOOM Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks. \nPENELOPE Oh. (beat) Hey, where's this boat going? \n69   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                   69 \nThe good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward. \n70   EXT. DECK - DAY                                                 70 \nBloom and Penelope stroll the deck. \n70   CONTINUED:                                                   70 \nBLOOM Why did you decide to come? \nPENELOPE Well I'd never been to Greece. Or Europe. Or outside New Jersey. \nBLOOM It just seems like a big leap. From where you were at yesterday to being a world traveler. \nTHE CURATOR And a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician.   My compliments. \nBloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away. \n74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74 \nThey stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship. \nPENELOPE Who is that man? You avoided him earlier on the deck. \nBLOOM I don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape. Do me a favor and steer clear of him. \nA waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen. \nBLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance? \nPENELOPE I went through a phase when I was mildly obsessed with the Bolero. \nBLOOM Give me a minute. \nHe leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen. She shivers. \nA match strikes.   She jumps. \nThe moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck. The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match. \nTHE CURATOR Mademoiselle. \nPENELOPE Monsieur. \nTHE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) I didn't mean to startle you. \nPENELOPE (in French, subtitled) Yes you did. \n74   CONTINUED:                                                 74 \nTHE CURATOR (in French, subtitled) Apologies, but the deck was dark, and I had to approach. (English) It's been such a time since I've encountered the Brothers Bloom. \nPENELOPE You're in antiques? \nTHE CURATOR (Cheshire grin) Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with? \nThe band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist, and a long thin blade falls into his hand. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) A little fear might suit you, I think. \nHe raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush, which he delicately employs. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) Bon soir, ma cherie. \nWith that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone. Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious. \nBLOOM It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best. \nHe hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the air, the Bolero suits it. \nThe moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark. \n75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75 \nBloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea. \n75   CONTINUED:                                                75 \nHis dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem. \nThen raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band. \n76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76 \nThe Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a beer can pinhole camera between them. \nPenelope gives a lesson on how it works. \nThe Chink appreciates her. \n77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77 \nBloom escorts Penelope to breakfast. \nPENELOPE How'd you find her? \nBLOOM The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She found us. \n78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78 \nBloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe. \nBLOOM (O.S.) A few years back, when we hit the top of our art dealing game, she just appeared. \nA door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette. \nBLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd) She's stuck with us. We figure when she gets bored she'll vanish with the same lack of noise. \nLike feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She drinks it without looking at him. \n79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79 \nSTEPHEN Nothing lasts. \nExit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his face. \n96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96 \nBloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed ATTENDANT runs past. \nA beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth. \nOff Bloom's quizzical look: \nPENELOPE Smuggling.     From the snack car. \nThey pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their sacks. \nBloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze. \n97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97 \nBloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros, while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers. \n97   CONTINUED:                                                   97 \nBLOOM Fourteen gins? Are you kidding me? \nTHE CHINK Jameson. \nBLOOM I'm not paying for that. \nShe holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two. \nATTENDANT Ice? \nShe says no with a look, they drink. \nBLOOM She made up the Smuggler Song. \nThe Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson. \nBLOOM (cont'd) I thought it was a Disney thing. \n98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98 \nThe lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk. \nBloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically by. \nPENELOPE Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you taken this train before? \nBLOOM Yeah. \nPENELOPE So this is all like fuckin `whatever' to you. \nBLOOM I usually drink with the Chink in the snack car, play cards. \nPENELOPE With the who? \n98   CONTINUED:                                                 98 \nOops. \nBLOOM Mrs. Yeungling. That's her smuggler nickname. \nPENELOPE That's offensive. \nBLOOM I think if it were offensive to her, she'd let us know. \nPENELOPE Do I get a smuggler nickname? \nBloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber band into Penelope's luggage. \nBLOOM No. \nPENELOPE I think you're constipated.   In your fuckin soul. \nBloom makes several attempts to form a response to this before giving up. \nBLOOM What? \nPENELOPE You've got a big load of grumpy petrified poop up your ass, I'm just calling you out on it. Yeah I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so you know what? I'm a fuckin smuggler. If that's your thing, fuckin tell it like you own it. When you've got a spotlight in front of your feet, man, fuckin jump into it and dance the shit out of it. Stop fuckin thinking so much. Enjoy the fuckin ride. Fuck. \nA roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) Whoa. \n98    CONTINUED: (2)                                             98 \nBLOOM Look, I'm not- \nPENELOPE Shh.    I love thunderstorms. \nAnother crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares, confused. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo ha ha ha ha. \nBeneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain falls harder. \nTHE CURATOR (blank, then realizes) Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise Belguta Rioso. I get his file. \n108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108 \nPenelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an array of beautiful paintings on the wall. \nPENELOPE Gin is slow death, man. \nStephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The Curator strolls in. \nSTEPHEN We'll see you back at the hotel. (glances at the Curator) Soon. \nThey go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed. \n108   CONTINUED:                                                    108 \nTHE CURATOR From a private collection on the island of Ikaria. That one. \nBLOOM Who painted it? \nTHE CURATOR I don't know. \nPENELOPE Why is it the last thing you see every night, and the first thing you see every morning? \nTHE CURATOR That's a story. You have a minute? \nHe closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting. Setting the stage. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) My daughter travelled with me when she was very young, and I'd show her the places and the art, all the most joyous and terrifying things in the world. \nMemories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun. \nTHE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) I wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her. To built her a pair of wings. Make these things real. But maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem. From a painting in a small private collection on the island of Ikaria. \nHe motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book. \nTHE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) Well Rachel, like most monsters the Golem was once a human. A boy, about your age. (MORE) \n108   CONTINUED: (2)                                             108 THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd) And one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his. They got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died. The boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened. So instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful. He pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones. Well. Years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which in his guilt he did quite a lot of) he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. He ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. He ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `Did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. But no, they said, motioning to the well. Nothing strange. Just stones. They left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence. \nThe last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing. \nIts dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows. \nThen, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well. \nSilence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the Curator, sitting very still. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) My daughter died nineteen years ago today. She was six. She went out to play one afternoon and vanished. (MORE) \n108   CONTINUED: (3)                                             108 THE CURATOR (cont'd) The next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property. I climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms. If you've had a child... my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe. But no matter what I said to her, I couldn't stop her shaking, crying. Her last moments on this earth were filled with terror. Of a stone golem. \nHe stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) It was the first painting I `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me. \n109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109 \nBloom trots out, ahead of Penelope. \nTHE CURATOR Mademoiselle. \nBloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on the staircase. The Curator comes out. \nTHE CURATOR (cont'd) It is you I do business with, yes? \nPENELOPE Right.   Oh, right. \nShe gives him the envelope with the certified check. He shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's. \nHe lets go, and smiles apologetically. \nTHE CURATOR Au revoir. \n110   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                  110 \nPenelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded, vibrant cobblestone streets. \nPENELOPE You aren't constipated. You're scared. What are you scared of? \nThey walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands. \nAs they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand holding off. Penelope notices why. \n111   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        111 \nStephen, up in the window watching them approach.   He recedes into the room. \n112   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                                112 \nThe sun sets against the castle, taking us into night. \n113   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                              113 \nBloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil. A smell breaks his concentration. \nBLOOM Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane. \nThe clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn. \nBloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open, the guttural snoring ringing in his ears. \n119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119 \nOur four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all step judiciously back. No response. \nSTEPHEN Max? \nBLOOM We're a little early... \n120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120 \nStill and silent in the breaking light of morning. \nAnd totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls. \nThe only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well... broken on the floor. \nOur intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness. Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window. \nPENELOPE The Golem came for him. In my dream. Crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way. \n120   CONTINUED:                                                120 \nBLOOM Well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death. \nPoking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas. \nTHE CURATOR (sotto) You're a little early. \nBloom quickly closes it. \nSTEPHEN I don't get it. If he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money. Well. Back to antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing lost. (to Penelope) And you got to see Prague, which is nice. \nPenelope's eyes widen with realization. \nPENELOPE Oh. \nBLOOM You should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things- \nBut Stephen raises a hand to shut him up. \nSTEPHEN Oh? \n121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121 \nSeveral empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's hand. All heads are slumped. \nPENELOPE Oh. \n121   CONTINUED:                                                    121 \nBLOOM It's my fault. I can't believe I left you alone with him. \nThe Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it. \nSTEPHEN The check was cashed yesterday afternoon, he'd have deposited it in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen. \nPENELOPE What a waste. \nBloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) That poor man. What a waste. \nBloom's expression turns quizzical. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) That poor Argentina man. He'll never see the book now, it'll just rot in the catacombs. What a waste. \nWhen Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear. \n122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122 \nBloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars. The Chink and Stephen stand by. \nBLOOM No. No no. Can't you see what happened here, there is no book, we've been swindled - \nPENELOPE But maybe there is, maybe it's real, we don't know! \nBLOOM It's not real, it's a con. \nPENELOPE It's my money, I'm going to find out for sure. He gave us every piece of information we need. \n122   CONTINUED:                                                  122 \nShe spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench. \nBloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a \"this is crazy right?\" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back. \nSTEPHEN We'd need to clear the administrative offices.   Some sort of disruption. \nThe Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness. \nPENELOPE (to Bloom) C'mon. Help me break into this castle. It'll be fun. \n123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123 \nAnd opens her mouth to speak. \n154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154 \nThe hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink sit watching for some sign. \nThree police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of the bridge. \nBLOOM The Chief of Police. \nAs the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged mesh in the back seat. \nHis face falls. \nThen Penelope spots him, points and says something. \nVery suddenly, the police car stops. \nThe Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three. \nAnd opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and salute her. \nHe kisses her hand. \nCHIEF OF POLICE (in Czech) It has been a privilege, madame, to behold even briefly such a strong, beautiful flower. \nPENELOPE (in Czech) Thank you sir, I will not soon forget your kindness. \nShe blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink. \n154   CONTINUED:                                                    154 \nThe police cars drive off. \nPenelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it on a bench. A moment of victorious silence. \nClapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) (sings) We're a band of smugglers hey, la la la la la, we smuggle by night, drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho... Everybody! \n155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155 \nBloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses. \nThe Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture. \nSTEPHEN Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave till eight. \nBLOOM That was real. \nSTEPHEN Yeah, I know. \nBLOOM Fuckin scary. \n156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156 \nBloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens' \"Miles from Nowhere\" plays from a nearby radio. \nHis eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit seller's cart. \nHe approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance. \nHoly shit.    He is going to steal that apple. \nDeftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens. \n156   CONTINUED:                                                   156 \nAnd turns. \nAnd sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite judgement. \nBloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER. \nThe vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints, apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips. \n157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157 \nStephen bails Bloom out. \nSTEPHEN An apple? \nBLOOM Yeah, but it was part of an epiphany. \n158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158 \nThe train thunders South, towards Greece. \n159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159 \nStephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight. \nAs soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with two mini bottles of gin. \nHe kisses her. \n160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160 \nPENELOPE What's up? \nHe pulls her out of the room. \n168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168 \nBloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops. \n168   CONTINUED:                                                168 \nPENELOPE Bloom.   What? \nDeep breath. \nBLOOM My brother and I are con men. All things considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today. And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it's all fake. It's all a con. \n169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169 \nThe waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance, Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes inside and turns out the light. \n170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170 \nBLOOM No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs. That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so... So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that. \nPENELOPE Wow. \nBLOOM But that's not how this one's going to end. I love you now, and I want to get you out of this. I'm going to do what I have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good. Are you ready? \n171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171 \nBloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand. \nBLOOM Stephen's gone into town to prep the Argentina actors. Your money's at his place. \nPENELOPE Money? I don't want the money, let's just leave. \nFor a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead. \nBLOOM C'mon. \n172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172 \nDark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark, switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on. \nSTEPHEN (O.S.) You have to switch it on at the base. \nA beat.   Bloom does. \nStephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not angry. Much more sad than angry. \nBLOOM So I've told her our whole play. And I'm here. To take her money back. How's that make you feel? \nSTEPHEN Disappointed. \nBLOOM This isn't the ending you wanted? \nSTEPHEN It doesn't matter now. This is the way it ends. So let's get it over with. \nBLOOM Where's the money? \n172   CONTINUED:                                                    172 \nSTEPHEN I ate it. \nBLOOM Give me the money, Stephen. \nSTEPHEN No. \nPENELOPE I don't want the money. \nBLOOM He's not going to keep a single piece of you. \nStephen stands. \nSTEPHEN I'm sorry you fell in love with her. But she's a mark. And all of this, all of it is a con. Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. That's what you're afraid of, right? That you don't know the difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that's what love is. \nPENELOPE We're leaving. \nSTEPHEN (to Bloom) No. You're too scared to leave. You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. The money is in my bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl. \nA long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen. \nPENELOPE Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please. \n172   CONTINUED: (2)                                              172 \nBloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw. \nStephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs Bloom's leg and brings him down. \nThen they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified. \nA frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart, thirty years worth of a fight. \nUntil Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet. \nUpsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground. \nBLOOM Hey. \nThe Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs- up of approval. \n177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177 \nBloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city. \nBLOOM How did you find me? \nPENELOPE The Chink. \nBLOOM How did you find the Chink? \nPENELOPE She gave me her cell when we got to Mexico. \nBLOOM I didn't even know she had one. \nPENELOPE I think she's kind of selective in who she gives the number to. \n178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178 \nThey sit with wine and bread. \nBLOOM Why are you here, Penelope? \nPENELOPE Why did you decide to stay with your brother instead of coming with me in Mexico? \nBLOOM Everything Stephen said that night was true. \n178   CONTINUED:                                                   178 \nPENELOPE I've been doing a lot of thinking the past three months. I want you to consider something. \nShe takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and slides it across the table to him. \nOn it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized fonts, is \"PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST.\" \nBloom sets the paper down with a snap. \nBLOOM Go away. Everything Stephen said was true. I was just playing you as a mark. Everything between us, none of it was real. \nShe leans in close to him, her hand on his leg. \nPENELOPE I don't believe you. \nIt's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right. \n179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179 \nBloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings. \nBLOOM Pick up... c'mon... \n180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180 \nLush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair holds his tear stained face in his hands. \nThis whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell phone chirps away. \nAnnoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod. \nStephen hastily answers it. \n180   CONTINUED:                                                180 \nSTEPHEN Hello? \n181   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        181 \nBLOOM How quickly can you get to Ferentino? \nSTEPHEN (ON PHONE) Uh... Nine-ish? \nBloom fishes out his pocket watch. \nBLOOM Alright. \nClick. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket. \n182   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           182 \nPenelope plays cards with the Grandmother. \n183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183 \nStephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the apartment. \nSTEPHEN So she comes back wanting to work with us. Honestly? I think we'd be lucky to have her. If you called me to hear my opinion on the matter. Which I'm getting the feeling you didn't. \nBLOOM I did what I did in Mexico to get her out of all this. I would rather die than bring her into the con. \nSTEPHEN So maybe you want to tell me what I'm doing in Ferentino. \n183   CONTINUED:                                                  183 \nBLOOM You knew she'd come back. What did you figure she was good for, another million? \n188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188 \nThe blood red sun sets over the city. \n189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189 \nPenelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack. \nThe phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up. \nSTEPHEN Our \"Russians\" have arrived. \n190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190 \nStephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a red suitcase. \n190   CONTINUED:                                                 190 \nBLOOM Who'd you get, anyway? \nSTEPHEN Hm? \nBLOOM To play the \"Russians?\" \nDING. \nThe elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog. \nDIAMOND DOG My boys. \n191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191 \nEmpty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS, waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter. Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area. \n192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192 \nBLOOM I don't understand. Tell me so I understand. Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard- \nSTEPHEN We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog's got his big store right here in St. Petersburg. \nBLOOM Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something? Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it. Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is I don't trust him. \n192   CONTINUED:                                                   192 \nSTEPHEN What's he gonna do? Steal our fake money? (beat) I've thought this one out, believe me. And we can't end it without him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok. \n193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193 \nThe red leather suitcase on the bar. \nDIAMOND DOG Stephen, still the grand architect with your symbols. Red for temptation, white for salvation. \nThe Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a loupe. \nDIAMOND DOG (cont'd) Impressive, boys. \nBLOOM It's trash. There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye. \nSure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben Franklin's eye on the bills. \nDIAMOND DOG Hm.  I'll be damned. (closes case) Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel attache. \nSTEPHEN This'll   do. We'll do the drop off at your   store. Make it scary, think a   movie version of the Russian   mafia, but don't hassle her. \nDIAMOND DOG Alright. \nThe Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest on his bandaged hand. \nHe then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew. \n193   CONTINUED:                                                   193 \nDIAMOND DOG (cont'd) I look forward to meeting the lady. Take care, boys. \nLeaving his gold lighter on the bar. \n194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194 \nThe Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot. \nSTEPHEN So. Our fake Russian attack. One small charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window. \nThe Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield. \nSTEPHEN (cont'd) So that one bang, then we roll off the road. Once we get clear of the car the Chink sets off the final charge, incinerating the car and the money in the trunk. This'll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town. After the bridge. \nStephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his jacket. \nBLOOM Ok. \n195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195 \nBloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is expressionless. \nBLOOM You've been awful quiet. \nShe doesn't react. \nBLOOM What happened? \nPENELOPE Yeungling went to get another car. \nBLOOM Where's Stephen? \nPENELOPE We don't know. He was gone. \nBloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his fingers over the dozens of bullet holes. \nGoes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila envelope. \nPENELOPE (cont'd) We're going to find him. If he escaped, he'll contact us. If they've got him, it's for ransom. \n205   CONTINUED:                                                 205 \nBLOOM Who's got him? \nPENELOPE The Russians. \nThe Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching Bloom's face against the dark forest depths. \n206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206 \nA desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug, loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands outside. \nBLOOM Stephen, god please what's happening. I don't know what to do. I don't know Stephen please. Please. What's happening. Please. \nA long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready. \nBut the Chink climbs out of the black sedan. \nPENELOPE Where does she get all these cars? \nBloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet the Chink in the middle of the parking lot. \nBLOOM If you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up. \nShe sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in. \nBLOOM (cont'd) No, please. Not now. I need your help here now, I don't know what to do. \nThe slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world. But she's leaving. \nShe hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching for an instant. \n206   CONTINUED:                                                     206 \nShe gives Penelope a quick little \"call me\" gesture, picks up her case and walks off. \nA truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets in. \nBloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in Chinese. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Thanks. \nThe engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a dramatic fireball. \nThe paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave. \nBloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just happened. \n207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207 \nA busy street, which a title card identifies as \"Chicago, Illinois.\" \nOn the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant. \n208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208 \nA dive.   The chef on the phone. \nCHEF Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok. \nALL THE COOKS Blooooom! \nHe puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper. \n209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209 \nBloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper. \n209   CONTINUED:                                                209 \nBLOOM Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok. So I've got \"We are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises.\" You sure? \nThis phrase, written on Bloom's paper. \nCHEF And then it end with \"Goodbye shit head.\" \nBLOOM Shit head? \nCHEF But it is different meaning in Mandarin, uh, endearing. \"Shit head\" if you have affection for shit. \n210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210 \nThe Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying. Bloom sits next to her. \nBloom lowers the gun, trembling. \nBLOOM Ask him if anyone else is here. \nShe does. \nBOY Nyet. \nBLOOM Ask him where the Diamond Dog is. \nPENELOPE Diamond Dog? (in Russian) Where is the Diamond Dog? \nBOY (in English) The Dog of Diamonds is gone. \nBloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and gets a quick answer. \nBLOOM Get the car started. \nPENELOPE What about him? \nBLOOM It's alright. \n213   CONTINUED: (2)                                            213 \nShe believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the boy. \nBLOOM (cont'd) You don't need to be afraid of him anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever come back here again. He doesn't concern you anymore. Understand? It's gonna be ok. \nThe boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off. \n214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214 \nBloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her. \nHe sprints towards her, screaming \nBLOOM Get out!   Get out of the car!! \nShe sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down. \nA hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope with glass. \nThe Mercedes roars off down the street. \nBloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open. \nPenelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian nesting doll. \n215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215 \nThe seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and Penelope holds a note. \nPENELOPE It's a ransom note. It says they have Stephen, it says they want the money wired to a specific account, they give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for. (MORE) \n215   CONTINUED:                                               215 PENELOPE (cont'd) Then an address to come to, at two p.m. In two hours. \nBLOOM I'll wire the money from my account, and we'll go get Stephen. \nPENELOPE It's a lot. \nBLOOM How much? \nPENELOPE I'll do it, I want to, I've got plenty- \nBLOOM How much are they asking for? \nPENELOPE One point seven five million. \nA cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach. \nBLOOM Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO. \nHe punches the dashboard. \nBLOOM (cont'd) No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if that's what this is, if that's all that this is, no NO NO. \nPENELOPE What are you talking about? \nBLOOM There's another possibility that I should of, I'm a fucking idiot. This might all be a con. By my brother. To get me - oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your money. Oh god. I'm going to be sick. \nPENELOPE Would he do that? To you? \nBLOOM I don't know. Yes.   Yes of course he would. (MORE) \n215   CONTINUED: (2)                                              215 BLOOM (cont'd) To tell a story so well it becomes real. The perfect con. That's his whole, goddammit, that's what. \nPENELOPE But you don't know. Let's transfer the money. You don't know. \nBLOOM Son of a bitch. \nPENELOPE You don't know. This is your brother's life. I'm gonna wire the money. \n216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216 \nBloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard again, helpless enraged and scared. \nPenelope gets in, looks at the address on the note. \nThe dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck. \nStephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards. \nJust before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back. \nBloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind him. \nHe turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by, through the torn backdrop. \nBloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby. \nSilence. \nBloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat, breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt. \nBLOOM Please tell me this is all gonna be ok. Tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what I always wanted and pulled off the perfect con. \nA long, long moment. \nStephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his face. \nSTEPHEN You said it, not me. \nHe stands, the shakiness gone. \nSTEPHEN (cont'd) Can I get a `wow' for this one? \nBLOOM You son of a bitch. \n220   CONTINUED: (3)                                            220 \nBloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow. \nFinally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes them, wipes blood from his lip. \nSTEPHEN Tastes like tin foil. Alright here's what I want you to do. The Chink split? \nBLOOM Yeah.   Clean exit. \nSTEPHEN How? \nBLOOM Car bomb. \nA hint of relief in Stephen's face. \nSTEPHEN Good. Here's what. Take Penelope back to Helsinki, take that flight to Rio. Lay low like we said. Play out the on-the-run-from- vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be fun for her. Play it like I'm dead, actually - that'll add some gravity to everything, that'll be nice. And I'll see you when I see you. \nBLOOM Soon? \nSTEPHEN I hope not. Last thing you need is me hanging around. Anyway, how could I top this? \nBloom hugs him again. \nBLOOM I love you. Bye. \nHe turns to go. \nSTEPHEN Hey.    Think of any card. \n220   CONTINUED: (4)                                            220 \nStephen pulls out a pack of cards. \nBLOOM Alright. \nStephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts. \nBLOOM (cont'd) Stephen. That's it. (grins) That's the best card trick I've ever seen. I just wish you had a bigger audience. \nSTEPHEN You're the only audience I've ever needed. \nWink.   Bloom leaves. \nStephen watches him go. \n221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221 \nRumbling towards Finland. \nIn the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives. \nShe looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with Stephen's \"blood.\" She strokes his shoulder sadly. \nOff Bloom's sleeping face... \n222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222 \nStephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in the spotlight's glare. \nTrembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world. \nSits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over it. \nThen slides is up his sleeve. \nBlood trickles down his hand. \n", "test1_input": "Several things happen at once. \nBloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike follows suit. \nUp on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9 and 5.6. \nThe Lamborghini screeches to a stop. \nEverything is still. \nThen the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then jolts and stops. \nBloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as us. \n59   CONTINUED:                                                  59 \nStephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused. \nOne last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward, veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to a stop. The horn blares. \nBloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance. \nStephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card - \n60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60 \nPenelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs.

HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61 \nBloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs. \nSTEPHEN The Chink had it - I'm telling him, I know, thank you - in her report, I missed it. This is actually kind of great, I'll tell you why. \nThe Chink lights a cigarette. \nBLOOM You missed it? \nSTEPHEN Dostoevsky was an epileptic. \nBLOOM I know. \nSTEPHEN His seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.

The Chink burps into her stethoscope. \n62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62 \nBloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep. \nBLOOM (V.O.) The next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life. \nBloom drifts off, then wakes with a start. \nIt is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him. \nPENELOPE I think they took my car.     Could you drive me home? \nBLOOM Uh.   Yeah. \nShe walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns. \nPENELOPE I'm Penelope Stamp. \nBLOOM Bloom. \n63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63 \nBloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window. \nBLOOM (V.O.) Engagement. Find a connection with your mark through conversation. \nBLOOM (cont'd) I'm sorry about your Lamborghini. \nPENELOPE S' ok. \nSilence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob, angling it to stare at him while looking out the window. \n63   CONTINUED:                                                        63 \nBLOOM Nice area. (beat) Jersey. \nMore silence. \nPENELOPE This car is like riding in a huge marshmallow. \nAnd still more silence. \nBLOOM (V.O.)

Get invited in for coffee, and tell them the full tale. \nBloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his dashboard. \nPENELOPE For the bike, and the whole, thing. This was a big shit sandwich. Ok. Bye. \nThe car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment. \nBLOOM (V.O.) However, there are advantages to playing it cool. Letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re- establish contact. \nBloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees Penelope in it, sprinting after his car. \nHe stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving. \n64   CONTINUED:                                                 64 \nPENELOPE I realized...

PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65 \nBloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen, neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks. \nThis is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts, then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again and gives an overbaked \"oh yes go on\" smile/nod, then does it all again. Three or four times. \nBLOOM ...didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in Charleston. So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died. Then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life. So we did, and we've been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, I'm sorry, stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok. Alright, look. \nPENELOPE I'm really bad at talking to people. \n65   CONTINUED:                                                     65 \nBLOOM I told you, that's alright.

Penelope leans against the window, looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters. \nBLOOM So what kind of stuff do you do? \nPENELOPE Nothing.   Maybe you should go. \nBLOOM Alright. I'm just gonna finish my coffee first. \nVery slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and noisier slurp. \nPENELOPE I collect hobbies. I see someone doing something I like, and I get books and learn how to do it. \nBLOOM Hm.   Anything interesting? \nPENELOPE Not really. \nHOBBY MONTAGE \nIn which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting seriousness and skill for Bloom: \nPlaying the piano.      The classical guitar.   The fiddle.   The banjo. \nPutting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle. \nExecuting a perfect ollie on a skateboard. \n66   CONTINUED:                                                      66 \nJuggling various items.

How do you plan to use all these skills? \nPENELOPE I dunno. I'm not a planner. I just do stuff. Here, look at this watermelon. It's a camera. You can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark. \n", "test2_input": "The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom alone on the deck.

He loved the idea that we were internationally infamous art smugglers, but I think deep down, same as me, he felt like we were putting on a persona, faking it. \nPENELOPE Telling a story. \nBLOOM He'd love to die on a job. Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell his story so well it fulfills itself. It somehow would make it finally real for him. \nPENELOPE That's kinda the thing we all want, right? \nHe looks at her in the sun. \nBLOOM Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.

The Young Detective returns with a report, hands it to Grace. \nYOUNG DETECTIVE \nAgent Vanderholt, a report came back on the name. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY \nLaval drives fast through a neat, modest neighborhood. Grace marveling at the police report. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nShe must have sounded like a total fruitcake. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThis is it. Grace watching Laval.      He looks pretty rough this morning. \nGRACE \nLet me go and be non-threatening. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY \nKNOCKING on the front door. The WOMAN from the ferry answers the door. Her name is REBECCA ASHER. She opens the door, smiles warmly at Grace. \nMRS. ASHER \nHi, please come in. Thank you for coming. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nClassy decor. Grace sips Earl Grey.       Admires the impressive antiques. \nMRS. ASHER \nI'm glad they finally sent someone, those hang-up calls have me terrified. They started right after I saw him. (a beat) I looked him directly in the eye. There was a moment of mutual recognition. \nGRACE \nDo you think it's Martin calling and hanging up? \nMRS. ASHER \nIt couldn't sound crazier, but who else? \nGRACE \nWere you ever asked to identify his body? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMRS. ASHER \nThe body? Yes, they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck. The upper body was crushed. There was no face. I got physically ill. Mrs. Asher studies Grace. \nMRS. ASHER \nYou're not Canadian, are you? \nGRACE \nNo.   I'm with the FBI. Grace shows her creds. \nMRS. ASHER \nThere was three. About two weeks ago. I began turning off my telephone when I go to bed. \nGRACE \nYou have some very nice things, Mrs. Asher. \nMRS. ASHER \nThank you. Some of them have been in my family for several generations. Please call me Rebecca. Grace looking at pictures on the wall of a good-looking, athletic kid. They stop at age fourteen. \nGRACE \nIs that Martin? \nMRS. ASHER \nNo. That's Reese. Martin's older brother. He drowned in a terrible accident. Grace notes a photo of a smiling young REESE receiving a long distance swimming trophy. \nGRACE \nI'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he drown? \nMRS. ASHER \nThe San Michel River. Martin fell out of their raft and Reese jumped in to save him. \n(MORE) \n", "test1_true": "CONTINUED: \nMRS. ASHER (CONT'D) \nThere was a lot of snowmelt that year. Martin reached the bank. Reese didn't. It was their fourteenth birthday. \nGRACE \nTheir fourteenth birthday? \nMRS. ASHER \nThey were twins. Identical twins. \nGRACE \nYou said Reese was older. \nMRS. ASHER \nBy three minutes. They were very different boys. \nGRACE \nTo lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later; to think you've lost him. That must have been devastating. Mrs. Asher lights a cigarette. Crosses to the window, so poised, so tragic. Grace studies her with a critical eye. \nMRS. ASHER \nReese was very charismatic and outgoing. Martin was introverted. He never thrived like Reese. He was a very disturbed young man. Reese was Martin's world. Martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him. He changed. Martin began to intimidate me. He could be very menacing. He began imitating Reese at school and that lead to fights with other students. At sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away. A few days later the Thunder Bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire. \nGRACE \nThe police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in Martin's grave and verify identity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMrs. Asher takes the paper. \nMRS. ASHER \nI'll sign it. I already know somebody else's son is in that casket. The PHONE RINGS. \nMRS. ASHER \nExcuse me. Mrs. Asher crosses to the kitchen and answers. Grace looking around, takes a look down a hallway. LAUGHTER O.S. as Mrs. Asher chats with a friend. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGrace pokes her head in, looks around.     Nothing of note. \nINT. MRS. ASHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe door opens and Grace peers in. Flowing silk, throw pillows, like a Sultan's tent. Interesting. \nINT. THE BOYS' ROOM - DAY \nGrace opens the door. Bingo. More LAUGHTER O.S. A bed, still made. Old toys. Sports equipment. An \"R\" on the headboard. On the other side; shadows on the wall where pictures used to hang. Indents in the carpet. Where a bed used to be. Grace's brow furrows.     Martin has been erased. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nGROWLING. Grace turns. Sees a diminutive DOBERMAN SNARLING at her. The miniature hound guards a door. A door with several locks.    Grace takes a step toward it. The tiny dog bares its fangs. Grace reaches for a deadbolt. The little DOG GROWLING. One deadbolt is open. CLICK. Grace opens the other one. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace cracks the door.       Darkness, stairs leading to the basement. \nMRS. ASHER (O.S.) \nThe bathroom is there. Grace startles.        Mrs. Asher is right behind her. \nGRACE \nI know.     I was snooping. Grace closes the door.       Mrs. Asher escorts Grace away, past the boys' room. \nMRS. ASHER \n(re: the boys' room) My friends call it the shrine.     It can be difficult to let go. \nGRACE \nI know. A beat. \nMRS. ASHER \nHe's killing people, isn't he? Grace nods:     yes.     Mrs. Asher assumed as much. \nGRACE \nThat doesn't surprise you? \nMRS. ASHER \nNo.   It doesn't. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY \nGrace gets in. Laval shaving with an electrical razor. Laval pulls out. \nGRACE \nThat lady is definitely a queen without a country. I should have curtsied. (watches him shave) Hygiene on the road. Very efficient. The razor dies.

There is nothing left to do here. Reynaud doesn't want to leave his dead comrade. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nI'm ordering you home. Reynaud acquiesces.     A Uniform escorts him out of there. Director Gillet crosses to Grace, who was watching him. She sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle. \nGRACE \nYou're really good with people. Gillet shrugs. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nHow's Mr. Costa? \nGRACE \nHe got off light. With a broken wrist and fifty stitches. Lucky man. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nMy luck has run out. Until today I have never had to bury a friend. Grace squeezes his arm. \nGRACE \nI'm sorry, Director. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nThankfully it's over. We have our man. Asher's DNA matched the hairs recovered on Ford's body and in the apartment. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY \nCosta's scalp is being stitched shut. Costa's wrist is in a splint.

That's not rawhide. \nDOCTOR \nI'll inject more anesthetic. Grace leans against the wall, smiles. \nGRACE \nYou okay? \nCOSTA \nI'm okay.    Thank you for rescuing me. \nGRACE \nAnytime. Do you know where he was taking you? \nCOSTA \nTo my grave.    He was going to kill me. \nGRACE \nIt's over. (a beat) Let me take you out tonight. Let's have some fun. I owe you that. \nCOSTA \nWhat's fun for you? You want to go to the shooting range or the morgue? Grace is hurt by that. \nCOSTA \nI'm sorry. \nGRACE \nIt's going to   take a couple days to depose you   and get a full statement. I    thought you might enjoy a break   before you have to... \nCOSTA \nI know a place. You drive. \nINT. SUPERKOOL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nUltra mellow. Grace and Costa chill on throw-pillows and tapestries. Persian trip-hop and hookahs. Grace and Costa have melted into a corner where they sip tea. Nobody has been more comfortable. Costa pours beer from a pitcher. \nCOSTA \nI'm happy to be alive but it's like this door has been opened.      I don't think I was naive. But everything is different now. \nGRACE \nYou'll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it. \nCOSTA \nHow do you deal with it? All the misery and pain and violence. \nGRACE \nI can stop monsters, John.     And because I can, I have to. \nCOSTA \n", "test2_true": "GRACE \nNeither.   It's just my job. \nCOSTA \nWhen I was in med school I saw a guy on a Harley get T-boned by a Daihatsu.

You were the cheese in the trap. We stopped a monster. That's what matters. Grace is utterly unapologetic.      It makes Costa like her even more. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nGrace is in manic cleaning mode. She pulls papers off the walls. Shoves a pile of clothing in the closet. Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket. She opens the door for Costa. He enters.        The room is still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy. \nGRACE \nI'm sorry.   I'm a pig. \nCOSTA \nI don't trust anyone who's too organized. Grace puts some MUSIC ON the CLOCK RADIO. \nGRACE \nWant a beer? \nCOSTA \nPlease. She grabs a couple cold ones from the mini-fridge. \nCOSTA \nWhich is it, are you a runner or chaser? \nGRACE \nWhat's that mean? \nCOSTA \nPeople like you -- \nGRACE \nPeople like me? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nYeah, people like you. Hardcore. Gung-ho people like you. And you know what I mean. People like you are either runners or chasers. Grace looks at Costa. \nGRACE \nYou are a trip, John Costa. He's not letting her off the hook.       She plays along. \nGRACE \nOkay. I guess I'm running and chasing. Costa REACTS. \nCOSTA \nI'm sorry.   I didn't know. \nGRACE \nGrowing up I quit speaking after that. I didn't say a word for three years. When you're not in the conversation, you get forgotten real quick. So I'd watch people. Study them. The mouth can say anything, but the body doesn't lie. The tilt of the head, the way the hands move. Grace draws closer.       Costa watching her mouth. \nCOSTA \nHow'd you get your voice back? \nGRACE \nThe day my Uncle died. The truth exploded out of me like a vision. My Uncle and Father had been arguing, there was a gunshot and my father was dead. \nCOSTA \nYou are very intense, you know that? \nGRACE \n", "test2_id": 1783, "test3_input": "I remember my Uncle telling me not to say anything.

I haven't shut up since. \nCOSTA \nWhy did your Uncle do it? \nGRACE \nLand. Great-grandpa owned half of Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted control and sold it all. All that's left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture. (sadly) My father's murderer got away with it because I couldn't open my mouth. \nCOSTA \nThat's a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl. Grace blinks, looks at Costa.     That's exactly what she needed to hear. \nGRACE \nSomething good game out of it. The dead can't speak. Now I'm their voice. Costa cups her face and kisses her. Grace breaks away, a little hesitant. Something is bothering her. \nGRACE \nMartin Asher is dead, right? Costa REACTS. \nCOSTA \nCan we please forget about him? \nGRACE \nThat's the point. He's dead, so there won't be a trial where you or I would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nWe haven't done anything. That's about to change. Grace stands, pulls him off the couch. Begins undressing him. She finds horrible dog-bite scars. \nGRACE \nJesus. \nCOSTA \nIn college we tried to make my friend's German Shepherd take a bong hit. \nGRACE \nHow mean.   Serves you right. Costa pulls Grace to her feet. Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa. Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy building. Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The phone CLATTERS to the floor. Grace's eyes widen. Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching into her panties. Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm. Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his. Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer. Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching. Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open. Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps. Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at. Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime scenes. Staring down at them. Costa turns to Grace, whispers. \nCOSTA \nLet them watch. Grace looking deep into Costa's eyes.        Nods her head. Costa flips her onto her stomach... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (5:41 A.M.) \nGrace and Costa spoon. Grace stirs.       Kisses the back of Costa's head. He's utterly still. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGrace enters, groggy.      Turns on the sink.   Flips on the light. Grace reacts, stumbles back. She's covered with blood.      Grace panics, feels herself for wounds. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nGrace shakes Costa.     Tears well in her eyes. \nGRACE \nJohn.    John. Costa stirs. \nCOSTA \nMmmmm.   Morning. He sees the blood.    Doesn't really react. \nCOSTA \nMy stitches must have ripped. Grace hands him a towel.      Presses it against his shoulder. \nGRACE \nI thought you were scared of blood? \nCOSTA \nYou better take a shower. \nINT.

Stares into the clouded eye. Mrs. Asher REACTS, quickly withdraws her hand. \nMRS. ASHER \nIt's not him. That's not my blood. You people are incredible. The Medical Examiner SIGHS, thinks she's a kook. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \nI'll swab your cheek and test your DNA against the body. Will that do it? \nMRS. ASHER \nGood idea, Doctor. He's smarter than all of you, do you know that? \nINT. EXAM ROOM - DAY \nThe Doctor staples Costa's scalp. \nCOSTA \nIs that going to hold?   I'm not coming back. Grace enters, in a serious mood. \nCOSTA \nWhat's wrong? \nGRACE \nThat was my boss. I'm going back to Quantico tomorrow. Suddenly that seems like the end of the world.       Costa looks at her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nWashington, DC has some of the best art in the world. Georgetown would be a great place to open a gallery.

A beat. \nGRACE \nNot her son?   You're sure? \nMEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.) \nLab ran the test twice. \nGRACE \nThat's weird. Was he adopted, switched at birth? \nMEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.) \nListen for a minute. There was a match. John Costa is Mrs. Asher's biological son. Grace laughs.     It's a joke. \nGRACE \nSo John Costa is really Martin Asher? \nMEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.) \nDear God, I wish I was joking. Grace turns and REACTS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCosta has been standing there. Listening. He tries to read Grace's expression, worry etching his face. Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million miles an hour. Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together. \nGRACE \nAre you Martin? Costa gasps.        The very thought is painful. \nCOSTA \nGrace, I'm John. Okay?      I'm John. Costa hoping against hope everything is okay.          But it's not okay. Grace has a calamitous expression. \nGRACE \nHoly shit. Costa takes a step toward her. The street cop motions for Costa to stay back. Costa REACTS. \nINT. HOSPITAL - COSTA'S POV - DAY \nGrace's purse sits on a chair in the exam room.          Her pistol visible. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY \nCosta takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along with her FBI credentials and car keys. Costa backs away from Grace. Costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to something much more menacing. The monster Martin Asher. Grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.

{"train": "Taking Lives \nby \nJon Bokenkamp \nbased on the novel by Michael Pye \nprevious revisions by Nicholas Kazan H. Seitz David Ayer \nEARLY DRAFT \nFebruary 28, 2003 \nFADE IN: \nINT. BUS STATION - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO \nSmall, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16, enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe. \nMARTIN \nSir. Sir, may I have a ticket to Montreal please? \nCASHIER \nPardon? \nMARTIN \nI need a ticket to Montreal. \nCASHIER \nMontreal? \nMARTIN \nYes, sir.     Please. \nCASHIER \nForty-three dollars. Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The DRIVER loading bags. \nINT. BUS - DAY \nA half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him, offers a hand. Martin shakes. \nDAN \nDan Soulsby. \nMARTIN \nMartin.     Nice to meet you. \nDAN \nWhere you heading to? \nMARTIN \nAway from here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers Martin one. \nMARTIN \nPisswater. \nDAN \nAt least it's cold pisswater. Here's to getting away. They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas. BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING. Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks. \nDAN \nThat was bad. (bummed) It's gonna take all day to get another bus here. Martin sighs, looks out the window. \nWHAT MARTIN SEES \nA car rental place. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMartin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket. \nMARTIN \nYou have a license? \nDAN \nHad one.    They took it away. \nMARTIN \nI got one.   Let's go. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nDan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth. \nDAN \nWOMAN \nYou need to open that grave.   It can't be my son in there. A beat. \nINSPECTOR \nI lost my mother two years ago. Every day I think I see her. Driving to work in the car next to me. At mass. Shopping, I see her, but this is someone else's mother. You see? The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye. There is something formidable about her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWOMAN \nInspector, I'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty. But let's focus on the matter at hand. He walked right past me. We made eye contact. I know he recognized me. It was my son. A mother knows these things. I will sign anything, I will swear before a judge. And thank you, I do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character. \nINSPECTOR \nDid you talk to this man, he is a man now? \nWOMAN \nYes. Of course he's a man. He'd be thirty-two. And no, I did not speak with him. I ran. (low, serious) Inspector, my son was very, very disturbed. He had serious emotional problems. I assure you he was. (a beat) Is. Is a dangerous person. He hands her some forms. \nINSPECTOR \nMadame. The police department cannot resolve your problem. You need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department. You pay for an exhumation. You have someone qualified examine the remains. If it is the wrong body, the Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us. Then we open an investigation. (a beat) No, Quebec City police will investigate. He is buried there, no? The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms. \nWOMAN \nNo.   Inspector. He is not. \nEXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nDeep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION \nWORKERS. \nA BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly, hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the headless body he has just dragged from its grave. Workers gather and gawk. \nWORKER \nSomeone call the cops. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT \nINSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French Canadians, pin photographs of the body we just saw on the wall. Laval steps back. Takes in the display. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(subtitled French) Think she will like this? Reynaud shrugs.    Laval tosses him a Newsweek. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(subtitled French) We are lucky the FBI is sending her. She is the Michael Jordan of criminal profiling. (off Reynaud's look) The Guy Le Fleuer of profiling. She will save our ass. The PHONE RINGS.   Laval answers. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(subtitled French) Inspector Laval. (a beat) Have the airline check again. Look around baggage claim. (to Reynaud) She was on the flight but they can't find her. Reynaud's CELL RINGS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \n(into phone) Oui? \nReynaud grabs his coat.     Turns to Laval. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \n(subtitled French) I know where she is. \nCUT TO: \nDARKNESS \nWe hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER.        Soft, rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS. Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.      The FOOTSTEPS drawing closer. CLICK!     A FLASHLIGHT turns on.   REVEALING: \nEXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT \nGRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up. Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from the bright light. \nGRACE \nIt's okay, I'm supposed to be here. CLICK.     The LIGHT goes off.   REVEALING Laval and Reynaud. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nAgent Vanderholt, we requested your help. I'm Inspector Laval, this is Inspector Reynaud. \nGRACE \nHi. Look, I'm not ready to talk to you guys yet. I need a little more time here. Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS guarding the site. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER \n(O.S.). \nGRACE \nWould you mind trading one liners somewhere else? I need to hear the natural sounds. I appreciate it. The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval gestures for them to walk down the road. \nGRACE \nBingo.   That's your murder weapon. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nIt might be trash a camper left. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nNo. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThat is a theory. \nGRACE \nThat's exactly what it is. A theory. That evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. Inspector. Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages. Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her quietly. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nLaval and Reynaud are my stars. Very smart, very persistent investigators. On the street; they're magnificent. \nGRACE \nI can see that Director.   You're lucky to have them. A beat. \nGRACE \nGo ahead, Director, say what you have to say. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nYou're the expert. If you have any suggestions on how to proceed... \nGRACE \nSure. A forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull. I know someone at Quantico who can do it by tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWe have people. \nGRACE \nCall 'em. Then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. You have his initials; MRC, inside the wetsuit. The long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him. It's a semi-long shot. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nNo, that's bread and butter detective work. Thank you. (checks his watch) We should get upstairs. They cross to the exit. Director Gillet barks orders in FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors. \nINT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY \nPhotos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls. Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES man the phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud. Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN. Grace sits next to Gillet. \nCOUNCILMAN #1 \nYou found the skull. Incredible. \nGRACE \nI had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains. \nCOUNCILMAN #2 \nSo I can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of Quebec? \nGRACE \nNo headhunters, sir.   However, a killer is out there. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOUNCILMAN #1 \nDirector Gillet. Do you have the victim identified? \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nNo name yet, sir. We have someone from the University recreating his face from the skull. \nCOUNCILMAN #1 \nWhy, after two years, has nobody reported him missing? \nGRACE \nHe wasn't missed. He had no family, or moved often. He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. He spent a lot of time in his kayak. \nCOUNCILMAN #1 \nThe big question is who killed him. \nGRACE \nComputer error? \nGRACE \nToo many independent systems. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(beat) We work organized crime sometimes, maybe a hit man wanted to lay low. He assumed the life of a civilian until things cooled off. \nGRACE \nYou really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide? Inspector, this guy's whole life has been stolen. Someone killed him and became him. Down to profession and taste in clothing. Laval and Reynaud trade looks. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) \nThe lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs. \nCrosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole. Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYou are a heavy sleeper. \nGRACE \nYou're everywhere. What's up, Laval? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nA man was killed tonight. Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles. And there's a witness. Or a suspect. We're not sure yet. We should go. \nEXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN MONTREAL) - \nNIGHT (4:00 AM) \nCop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with Laval. Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the back of a cop car. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThat's him.   He says he saw the killer. Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nMeet Mr. Todd Ford. Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck. \nGRACE \nHe's still warm. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      A couple hairs glow in the strong light beam. \nGRACE \nWant to get those? The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs. \nGRACE \nWhere is it? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThere.   Under his car. Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there, made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord. \nGRACE \nHoly shit.   Has Le Directeur been notified? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nI'm letting the poor man sleep a couple more minutes. (pointing things out) Twenty-four hour gym is there, next door. He has a membership card in his wallet. That's his car. Car keys. Grace looks around the garage.      Taking it all in. Getting a feel for the scene. She carefully examines the victim's car with her flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print dust. \nINT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT (4:43 AM) \nDirector Gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T- shirt. Looking through a two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud are with him. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nIs that our killer? \nGRACE \nMaybe. So far he checks out as an art dealer from Winnipeg. \nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT \nJOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses, moppish hair. Laval sits across from him. Costa is sincere, and frightened. \nCOSTA \nI walk out of the gym. Walk to my car. I'm unlocking it and I hear a scuffle, a fight. Over by this car I see this guy getting choked from behind and I shouted. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nWhat did you shout? \nCOSTA \n'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then the person doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran. I'm so stupid. I could of been shot. I called the police gave him CPR until the paramedics came. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYou touched him? \nCOSTA \nCOSTA \nThank you. He had these real intense eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCosta about to start drawing. \nGRACE \nHold on. Before you do that, I need some personal information from you. Can you write down the name of the elementary school you attended? And your elementary school teachers, as many as you can remember. Costa looking at Grace a beat. \nCOSTA \nAre you kidding me? Lady, I saw someone get killed tonight and you're asking me about grade school? \nGRACE \nI apologize, I know it's random, but it's the best way you can help me. \nCOSTA \nI don't remember any of that. \nGRACE \nPlease, Mr. Costa. You'd be surprised. \nCOSTA \n(writing) I attended two. Holy Trinity and Mother of Good Counsel. I remember Sister Bernard. And. I don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr. Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien, she had a glass eye. \nGRACE \nMay I? She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa glances at the garrote, REACTS. \nCOSTA \nOmigod.   That's it, isn't it? \nGRACE \nThat's what? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nThe thing around his neck. Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game. \nCOSTA \nI told the other guy, I'll tell you. I did not do this. Grace. I saw who did this and I can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him. Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag. \nGRACE \nGo ahead and draw the face of the man you saw. Costa draws a simple smiley face.     He shows her. \nGRACE \nWe'll get an artist to help you. \nCOSTA \nI can draw him, thank you. Grace crosses to the door.     Costa begins drawing in earnest. \nINT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT \nGrace emerges from the interrogation room. Reynaud hands her a printout of Costa's school records. Grace checking Costa's list against his transcripts. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYou left a file in there. \nGRACE \nI know. See if he tries to peek in it. The real killer couldn't resist. He'll want to know what we know. Laval watches Costa. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nCosta draws with skilled hands, delicate but strong.      The file is ignored. \nINT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT \nGrace hands Laval back Costa's file. \nGRACE \nCan you remember any of your grade school teachers? He remembered three. A Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nHere's his provincial driver's license photo. He's checking out. Laval shows Grace the photo.   It is definitely Costa.    A beat. \nGRACE \nHave a nurse take a DNA sample. Just to make sure his DNA isn't in the victim's car or anything weird. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nWe'll run the tests. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nCosta has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the mirror, for those he assumes are watching. REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA'S SKETCH.   Cold piercing eyes, chiseled features. The door opens, expecting Grace, Costa is disappointed to see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton swab. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nI couldn't sleep. \nGRACE \nOur suspect kills Kohler on the river, lives his life a year, kills Edwards and assumes his ID for a year. Then he stalks Ford, kills him but is interrupted by Costa. Think he's pissed at Costa? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nOf course. The Young Detective returns with a report, hands it to Grace. \nYOUNG DETECTIVE \nAgent Vanderholt, a report came back on the name. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY \nLaval drives fast through a neat, modest neighborhood. Grace marveling at the police report. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nShe must have sounded like a total fruitcake. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThis is it. Grace watching Laval.      He looks pretty rough this morning. \nGRACE \nLet me go and be non-threatening. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY \nKNOCKING on the front door. The WOMAN from the ferry answers the door. Her name is REBECCA ASHER. She opens the door, smiles warmly at Grace. \nMRS. ASHER \nHi, please come in. Thank you for coming. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nClassy decor. Grace sips Earl Grey.       Admires the impressive antiques. \nMRS. ASHER \nI'm glad they finally sent someone, those hang-up calls have me terrified. They started right after I saw him. (a beat) I looked him directly in the eye. There was a moment of mutual recognition. \nGRACE \nDo you think it's Martin calling and hanging up? \nMRS. ASHER \nIt couldn't sound crazier, but who else? \nGRACE \nWere you ever asked to identify his body? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMRS. ASHER \nThe body? Yes, they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck. The upper body was crushed. There was no face. I got physically ill. Mrs. Asher studies Grace. \nMRS. ASHER \nYou're not Canadian, are you? \nGRACE \nNo.   I'm with the FBI. Grace shows her creds. \nMRS. ASHER \nThere was three. About two weeks ago. I began turning off my telephone when I go to bed. \nGRACE \nYou have some very nice things, Mrs. Asher. \nMRS. ASHER \nThank you. Some of them have been in my family for several generations. Please call me Rebecca. Grace looking at pictures on the wall of a good-looking, athletic kid. They stop at age fourteen. \nGRACE \nIs that Martin? \nMRS. ASHER \nNo. That's Reese. Martin's older brother. He drowned in a terrible accident. Grace notes a photo of a smiling young REESE receiving a long distance swimming trophy. \nGRACE \nI'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he drown? \nMRS. ASHER \nThe San Michel River. Martin fell out of their raft and Reese jumped in to save him. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace trying not to laugh, hands him a form. \nGRACE \nShe signed.   Start digging. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY \nA back hoe rips a bucket of earth from amidst the graves. A couple UNIFORMS watch. \nINT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY \nA cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney. The lid has been removed. Grace, Laval and Reynaud peer inside and REACT. Reynaud looks ill. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \nHmm. Could be worse after getting run over by a pickup and twenty years in the ground. \nINT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER) \nThe body has been moved to the exam table. Covered with mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue velvet. The Medical Examiner checks the scale. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \nBodies get mixed up all the time. Police found the wallet, called the mother and nothing was cross- checked. This was his head. Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin. Slices it open, revealing skull fragments and teeth. Passes them off to an ASSISTANT. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \n(to the assistant) Get that to Doctor Shivani and make sure someone signs for it. (to Grace) She'll rebuild his jaw line and check it against Martin Asher's dental X-rays. \nGRACE \nHow soon, sir? \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \n(shrugs) This is a priority case, this afternoon maybe. \nINT. POLICE GYM - DAY \nFive XL-sized COPS pump iron before their shift. \nCAMERA FINDS GRACE. \nShe's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25- pound plate to her chest. She's a machine. Sweating. Intense. The cops can't help but to be impressed. Grace's CELL RINGS. She doesn't stop, does sit-ups faster. At the last second she answers. \nGRACE \n(into phone, panting) Vanderholt. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.) \n(filtered) Am I interrupting something? \nGRACE \nYes.   What? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.) \nThe X-rays don't match. \nGRACE \nFind the real Martin Asher. He's your killer. (a beat) You better get his mother someplace safe. \nEXT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nAn UNMARKED parked with Laval and Grace inside.     They watch: \nINT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT \nMRS. ASHER checking in. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nGRACE \nHow'd she finagle a room there? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nShe's a very slick woman. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nShe didn't have one picture of Martin. Not one. Even cut him out of the old yearbooks. And she had a basement door like a vault. She's hiding something. In the basement of her house. What is it, ten minutes away from here? Her house. A beat.   Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nIf she's under our protection and something happens to her house, her belongings, the department could be liable. There could be a lawsuit. \nGRACE \nYou're right. We should make sure her front door is locked. Laval makes a U-turn. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe front door opens. Revealing Grace, and Laval as he pockets a lockpick gun. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nReynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking the door's lock. Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look. \nCOSTA \nIs this about the strangling?   Is that guy after me? \nGRACE \nPlease relax, Mr. Costa. We don't know if there's a connection yet. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nIs anything missing. \nCOSTA \nNo.  Everything's here. (a beat) Shit. He took my organizer and my business checkbook. Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND GALLERY - DAY \nGrace and Laval. \nGRACE \nHow do we know Costa didn't stage this? For attention or something. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nHe's happy to see you. But the alarm was jumpered. Do you think Costa knows how to jumper an alarm? \nGRACE \nWe should take the computer. Costa who has followed them out, overheard. \nCOSTA \nDon't take the computer.    That's my brain. Costa turns to Grace. \nCOSTA \nI'm not making this up.     Believe me. Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley. \nGRACE \nShould I believe you? Grace crosses to the ATM.   Peers into its security camera. \nGRACE \nOr should I believe this. \nCOSTA \nBelieve what you want. He's cocky, Grace likes that. \nEXT. ALLEY - ATM VIDEO - NIGHT \nBeing fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.        Locks the door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME. A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM customer moves on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNobody is there.     Then: MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door. APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME. Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER. \nCUT WIDE TO: \nINT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT \nCosta, Grace, Laval and Reynaud. Costa stands there looking at Asher's image on the video monitor. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nIs that the man you saw choking Mr. Ford? Fear flashes across Costa's face. \nCOSTA \nI must of walked right past him. \nGRACE \nMr. Costa, is that the man you saw kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot? \nCOSTA \nYes. That's him. That is the man I saw murder Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym. No doubt. Now will you go catch him, please? \nGRACE \nThank you.   I just needed you to say it. \nCOSTA \nWho is this guy? He's like a Ninja. Sneaking into my office. How dangerous is he? Does he want to kill me? \nGRACE \nJohn, no harm will come to you. Listen to me. No harm will come to you. I promise. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe gestures at Laval and Reynaud.     Costa turns to them. \nCOSTA \nHow many people have you killed? \nReynaud shrugs. \nCOSTA \nWhat? \nBLACK MAN \nWe're calling it off. \nEXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT \nCosta bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and Laval watching. \nCOSTA \nI have a life. I can't play superhero for you. I don't handle stress very well. I have an art show to open tomorrow and I don't know what I'm putting on the walls yet. \nGRACE \nI know you have a life. So did the people who have lost theirs. Someone else might die if you do not help us. Every time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives. Costa looks at her, arms on his hips. \nCOSTA \nGrace, I've been cooperating. I even drew you a picture. You can't put your responsibility on me. You have a badge, not me. \nGRACE \nIf somebody else dies, and you know you could have done more to stop it, you're going to feel like shit for a very long time, Mr. Costa. A beat.   That resonates with Costa. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nI want to help you guys but I don't have time to hang out and listen to bad techno. \nA beat. \nGRACE \nIt's okay to be scared. \nCOSTA \nScared? I'm off-the-charts terrified. There's a pissed-off serial killer after me. I mean, what did I do to him? \nGRACE \nYou saw him and that's enough. Don't stop living your life. You'll be protected by armed officers twenty-four seven. \nCOSTA \nUntil he's caught? \nGRACE \n(softly) I can't promise you that. Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him. \nCOSTA \nI have a lot of work to do. \nGRACE \nA car is watching the gallery. You'll be okay. Costa looking at Grace.     He decides to trust her. \nINT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY \nDirector Gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe. Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the tired couches. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nSo who was in Asher's grave? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nDan Soulsby. He went missing from the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nI'm sure Soulsby's death was a homicide, Asher saw the opportunity and took it. He became Soulsby and bummed around Seattle for a couple years. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWhy is Asher after Costa? Why isn't he in Mexico getting a new face? \nGRACE \nCosta saw him. Costa caught him in the act, caught him being Martin Asher. Seen first by his mother, then by Costa. For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards. To be seen, to be recognized, is a horrifying thing to Asher. He has no identity and wants it that way. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWhere is the real Mr. Edwards? \nGRACE \nLikely dead and buried south of the border somewhere. (beat) South of the American border somewhere. Visa records put Asher, using Kohler's ID and Edwards at a Mexican surf resort. Edwards' last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a 'no questions asked' facelift clinic in Guadalajara. Director Gillet taps out his pipe.     Looks at a new, more detailed portrait of Asher. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nHave you contacted the clinic? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYes. They are also 'no questions answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills, thanks to money from Edwards. \nON GRACE \nRunning.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a missile. Grace is slowly gaining on Asher. \nLaval behind her.      Running.   Screaming in his radio. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(subtitled French) We're heading East. Form a line at Seychelles. A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - DAY \nPolice RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP bumpers, blocking the intersection. POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line. SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside. \nEXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT \nAsher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection ahead. Asher shoves his hand in his pocket... \nBOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP! \nThunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES. It's not gunfire... \nTILT UP. \nFIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire. Rivers of sparks. Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for Asher. Laval reaches her. \nGRACE \nShit.     You see him? POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.         Laval gestures for some Uniforms to spread out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA SHRILL SCREAM O.S. \nFrom an apartment building. Grace runs into the building. Laval follows her. \nINT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nGrace and Laval running.   More SCREAMING O.S.    They run upstairs. \nINT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nAn UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge inside. \nINT. UPSET WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered. Below and beyond is a long rooftop. Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St. Lawrence River. \nGRACE SEES -- \nASHER jump from the far end of the roof. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nLaval will go no further. Grace gets a running start, jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her feet again, Grace sprints along the roof. FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.   THUMPING TECHNO. Grace reaches the edge of the roof.     REACTS.   Reynaud has caught up with her. \nEXT. RIVER PARK - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT \nAsher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates all sound. \nEXT. RIVER PARK - NIGHT \nGrace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd. \nFIND ASHER -- \nA dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears a huge bundle of glowing necklaces. Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of \nDANCERS. \nFIND GRACE -- \nShe and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment. Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher turns... \nIT'S NOT ASHER. \nGrace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through the crowd. Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal... \nA FIGHT \nTwo drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around; no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in and arrest the two Jocks. Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at Grace, they know they've been beaten. \nEXT. RIVER PARK - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT \nPULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion. \nCAMERA FINDS A DANCER. \nSome dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES. \nPUSH IN ON THE DANCER. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIt's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand, Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity. \nASHER'S EYES \nDangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves through the crowd. Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with her. Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces. Grace passes within feet of Asher. Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher complies. \nINT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nIt's late. Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged. INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace enters, crosses to Costa. She's tense, wound tight. \nGRACE (O.S.) \nThat would be out of bounds. Grace looking at him. Costa looking at her. A staring match. Costa and Grace try not to laugh. They end up giggling. \nCOSTA \nWhat was that? \nGRACE \nI don't know. John, games are fun. But head games are dangerous. \nCOSTA \nThen keep your head out of it. A beat.   Grace shrugs, back to business. \nGRACE \nThe Justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until Mr. Asher is in custody. \nCOSTA \nI don't know what your deal is. One second you're so there, then all I get is the badge. \nGRACE \nI apologize if you've been getting the wrong signal. \nCOSTA \nYeah.   Relocate where? \nGRACE \nAnother province. They want you on a flight tomorrow morning. \nCOSTA \nThis monster comes into my life and I have to leave? A UNIFORM SERGEANT enters. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSERGEANT \nMy people are in place. \nGRACE \nThank you, Sergeant. The Sergeant exits. \nCOSTA \nThis is surreal. What do I pack? \nGRACE \nWhat you need.   Movers can get the rest. \nCOSTA \nI need tomorrow morning to finish up my business here. \nGRACE \nI'll let them know. This is goodbye.     Neither of them feels very good about it. \nCOSTA \nI thought you were going to check under my bed. Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed, stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts. \nGRACE \nNo monsters. \nCOSTA \nThank you. Grace holds out her hand.      They shake. \nGRACE \nI probably won't see you again until the trial. If there is a trial. \nCOSTA \nGoodbye, then. Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall. A bold move. Now they are eye to eye. Grace kisses Costa for a long beat. Grace breaks the kiss. Holds a finger to her lips; shhh. She turns and exits. The door shuts behind her. Costa is going to miss Grace. \nEXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe next morning. Laval pulls up in UNMARKED #1, next to the patrol car that has been guarding Costa's apartment. With a wave the UNIFORM behind the wheel drives off. Laval exits his car. Crosses to Costa's door. \nNEW ANGLE \nReynaud and Grace have just pulled to the curb a half block away. \nINT. UNMARKED #2 - DAY \nReynaud behind the wheel, turns to Grace. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nYou spent a lot of time with Costa. Grace isn't sure if that's an accusation. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nI like him.   He's a good guy. Grace smiles. \nEXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLaval RINGING the bell. A white PLUMBER'S VAN pulls up behind Laval's unmarked. A PLUMBER gets out.    Coveralls, clipboard.    Crosses to another apartment. Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.       Laval takes one. Costa takes one last look at his home.       Locks the door. Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down. Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1. The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him, \nA head-on imminent.    The Buick swerves onto the shoulder. Just missing them. \nINT. UNMARKED #2 - MOVING - DAY \nGrace watches Costa's unmarked SCRAPE past the truck.        A side mirror is knocked off. The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt. Overcompensates, now heading right for Grace... Grace REACTS, swerves. BAM!   The cars hit.   Grace gets a face full of airbag. \nEXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY \nGrace's car spins off the road. Stops in a ditch.       A beat. The Buick's hulk blocking the road. Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses to the Buick. Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car. \nGRACE \nIs everyone okay? They seem alright. \nGIRL #1 \nYeah. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGIRL #2 \nI think so. \nGIRL #3 \nOmigod, I have to call my mom. A POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a stop. Then another POLICE CAR. Grace runs to one of the police cars. \nGRACE \nThey're okay. Let's go. (points up the road) He just shot a cop. Grace jumps in the passenger seat.        The COP looking at her. \nGRACE \nLet's go.   Bad guy's that way. The Cop nods, PUNCHES IT. \nINT. UNMARKED #1 - MOVING - DAY \nCosta is driving towards the mountains.        Driving through the pine forest. \nASHER \nThere.   Turn there. A hard-to-see side road. Costa JAMS the BRAKES to make the turn. Asher SLAPS him. \nASHER \nCareful. \nCOSTA \nOkay. Sorry. Sorry.      You don't want to do this. \nASHER \nYes I do. John, do you have any idea how many people I have killed? It's always been business. This time is personal. \nCOSTA \nPlease be cool. C'mon, we don't even know each other. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nASHER \nShut up. Art Man. You are stupid or crazy or both. Will you drive faster? I'll shoot you in the thigh. Will that get your attention. Costa speeds up. \nCOSTA \nDon't, man. I got money. You want money, I'll give you money. I got paintings. What do you want? Talk to me, Martin. \nASHER \nI am not Martin. There is no Martin. \nCOSTA \nOf course. No Martin. What do you want? What's my life worth to you? \nASHER \nNothing. And everything. This is deeper than money. Shut up. Talk is done. Talk is over. Understand that. You are over. Just shut the fuck up. Asher lights a cigarette.     A sharp turn ahead.    Costa speeding up. \nCOSTA \nOkay, please, Martin.   Martin.   Be cool. Asher aims his pistol at Costa's head. \nASHER \n(really pissed) Who the fuck is Martin? Costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving straight at a large tree... Asher REACTS. Costa jams his thumb into the release button of Asher's seatbelt... Asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe unmarked car hits the tree... POW!   Airbags deploy. \nCosta's body is slammed by crash forces but stays put... Asher goes over his airbag.     Asher's head goes through the windshield. \nINT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY \nThe Cop GUNS it into the mountains.       A fork in the road. \nCOP \nWhich way do I turn? \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nPlease, Jean. I called your wife. I'm having someone take you home to her. There is nothing left to do here. Reynaud doesn't want to leave his dead comrade. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nI'm ordering you home. Reynaud acquiesces.     A Uniform escorts him out of there. Director Gillet crosses to Grace, who was watching him. She sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle. \nGRACE \nYou're really good with people. Gillet shrugs. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nHow's Mr. Costa? \nGRACE \nHe got off light. With a broken wrist and fifty stitches. Lucky man. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nMy luck has run out. Until today I have never had to bury a friend. Grace squeezes his arm. \nGRACE \nI'm sorry, Director. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nThankfully it's over. We have our man. Asher's DNA matched the hairs recovered on Ford's body and in the apartment. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY \nCosta's scalp is being stitched shut. Costa's wrist is in a splint. She watches the DOCTOR sew flesh for a beat. A KNOCK.     Grace enters.   Grace smiles warmly at Costa. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nHey. \nCOSTA \nHey. (winces) Ouch, Doc. That's not rawhide. \nDOCTOR \nI'll inject more anesthetic. Grace leans against the wall, smiles. \nGRACE \nYou okay? \nCOSTA \nI'm okay.    Thank you for rescuing me. \nGRACE \nAnytime. Do you know where he was taking you? \nCOSTA \nTo my grave.    He was going to kill me. \nGRACE \nIt's over. (a beat) Let me take you out tonight. Let's have some fun. I owe you that. \nCOSTA \nWhat's fun for you? You want to go to the shooting range or the morgue? Grace is hurt by that. \nCOSTA \nI'm sorry. \nGRACE \nIt's going to   take a couple days to depose you   and get a full statement. I    thought you might enjoy a break   before you have to... \nCOSTA \nI know a place. You drive. \nINT. SUPERKOOL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nUltra mellow. Grace and Costa chill on throw-pillows and tapestries. Persian trip-hop and hookahs. Grace and Costa have melted into a corner where they sip tea. Nobody has been more comfortable. Costa pours beer from a pitcher. \nCOSTA \nI'm happy to be alive but it's like this door has been opened.      I don't think I was naive. But everything is different now. \nGRACE \nYou'll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it. \nCOSTA \nHow do you deal with it? All the misery and pain and violence. \nGRACE \nI can stop monsters, John.     And because I can, I have to. \nCOSTA \nI remember my Uncle telling me not to say anything. And I didn't. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE (CONT'D) \nI made myself forget why. The day he died my voice and my memory came back. I screamed for an hour. Very primal. I haven't shut up since. \nCOSTA \nWhy did your Uncle do it? \nGRACE \nLand. Great-grandpa owned half of Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted control and sold it all. All that's left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture. (sadly) My father's murderer got away with it because I couldn't open my mouth. \nCOSTA \nThat's a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl. Grace blinks, looks at Costa.     That's exactly what she needed to hear. \nGRACE \nSomething good game out of it. The dead can't speak. Now I'm their voice. Costa cups her face and kisses her. Grace breaks away, a little hesitant. Something is bothering her. \nGRACE \nMartin Asher is dead, right? Costa REACTS. \nCOSTA \nCan we please forget about him? \nGRACE \nThat's the point. He's dead, so there won't be a trial where you or I would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nWe haven't done anything. That's about to change. Grace stands, pulls him off the couch. Begins undressing him. She finds horrible dog-bite scars. \nGRACE \nJesus. \nCOSTA \nIn college we tried to make my friend's German Shepherd take a bong hit. \nGRACE \nHow mean.   Serves you right. Costa pulls Grace to her feet. Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa. Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy building. Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The phone CLATTERS to the floor. Grace's eyes widen. Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching into her panties. Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm. Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his. Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer. Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching. Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open. Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps. Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at. Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime scenes. Staring down at them. Costa turns to Grace, whispers. \nCOSTA \nLet them watch. Grace looking deep into Costa's eyes.        Nods her head. Costa flips her onto her stomach... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (5:41 A.M.) \nGrace and Costa spoon. Grace stirs.       Kisses the back of Costa's head. He's utterly still. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGrace enters, groggy.      Turns on the sink.   Flips on the light. Grace reacts, stumbles back. She's covered with blood.      Grace panics, feels herself for wounds. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nGrace shakes Costa.     Tears well in her eyes. \nGRACE \nJohn.    John. Costa stirs. \nCOSTA \nMmmmm.   Morning. He sees the blood.    Doesn't really react. \nCOSTA \nMy stitches must have ripped. Grace hands him a towel.      Presses it against his shoulder. \nGRACE \nI thought you were scared of blood? \nCOSTA \nYou better take a shower. \nINT. AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT (4:30 A.M.) \nMrs. Asher looking at Martin Asher's remains.       The charred torso, blackened thighbones. Mrs. Asher reaches for Asher's red swollen face. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER \nPlease don't touch the remains. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe gives him a withering look. \nWho? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nASHER \nI should have cut her throat when I saw her on the ferry. That's the least she deserves. Please don't do anything, Grace. It would hurt me so much if I had to hurt you. \nGRACE \nGood idea.   Don't hurt me. Costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim determination. He turns, enters a stairwell and exits the building. Grace's heart is breaking. \nGRACE \nShit! She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the stairwell. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nAsher gets into Grace's unmarked.      And drives away. Grace exits the building, watches him go. Grace has no way to follow.     Then... She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE by his patrol car. \nGRACE \nPolice emergency. We need to pursue him. He's a murder suspect. The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone. \nGRACE \nDirector Gillet, there's an emergency, can you please tell this officer to cooperate with me? Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop. \nEXT. NICE HOTEL - DAY \nA patrol car stops in front. Grace leaps out and runs into the building. An Unmarked pulls up. Reynaud jumps out and enters the building. \nINT. NICE HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY \nGrace running.   Reading room numbers.     Reynaud appears in the hall. Grace finds the right room.    Reynaud joins her, gun drawn. The door is ajar.     Grace pushes it open. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - GRACE'S POV - DAY \nA MAID changes the sheets.    Mrs. Asher is gone. \nINT.

HIGHWAY - DAY \nSIRENS SCREAMING, flashing lights as six police cars zip by at 90. \nINT. UNMARKED - DAY \nGrace over the shock and harder than steel.       Reynaud drives fast. Grace on her cell. \nGRACE \nNo answer.     She turns her phone off. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Asher sits on her couch. Asher stands.        The teeny Doberman walks into the room, sniffs Asher. \nASHER \nWhat happened to Rex?     He was a real dog, right, Mom? Rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMRS. ASHER \nDon't show me that, Martin. I had Rex put down after you ran away. Martin, sit. \nAsher looks at her defiantly.     Mrs. Asher stands, gets in his face. \nMRS. ASHER \nHow dare you defy me. You will sit down on that couch and you will do it now. Martin. Asher sits. Mrs. Asher lays a hand on his, leans forward, her eyes intense and earnest. \nMRS. ASHER \nMartin, you have severe emotional problems. I know you're in a lot of pain. There's hope and help, Martin. Look at me, Martin. I love you very much. \nMARTIN \nI know now that what you did to me was not love. \nINT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAsher sitting on the couch.     Then stands. \nASHER \nI'll stand if I want to stand. I can do anything I want to do. And I've done some great things, Mother. I'm not a scared little boy you can push around anymore. \nNEW ANGLE \nMrs. Asher's head neatly adorns a silver platter. \nINT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY \nGrace holds on as Reynaud slaloms around a corner in Asher's neighborhood. \nNot here. This city no longer has the psychic gravity to hold him here. Try Mexico, getting a facelift. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWe ID'd the remains in the morgue. The real ID. He hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was Asher. \nGRACE \n(reads) Richard Hart. \nFLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder. Inserts it into a fancy lamp. A hypodermic stands by to reward his work. \nDIRECTOR GILLET (V.O.) \nHe was an addict. And a thief. An art thief. He hits galleries in Europe and North America. Traveled back and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses. \nINT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT) \nGrace puts it together. \nGRACE \nLet me guess, Costa was selling stolen art for Hart and never gave him the money. Now Hart is just another one of Asher's victims. Director Gillet. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nCosta owed him eight thousand. Those are E-mails off Hart's computer. \nGRACE \n(reading) Go to hell. I won't pay you a dime. I'm not scared of you. \nFLASHBACK - INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT \nRichard Hart checks his E-mail and nearly has a heart attack. \nGRACE (V.O.) \nCome and get me. I will never pay you, dumbass. (thinks a beat) Asher taunted Hart into a confrontation. Jesus. It was right there in my face. I was interpreting behavior from two different suspects. \nBACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nHe had us all fooled, Grace. All of us. If Asher can do that, what else can he do? \nGRACE \nAnything he wants. KNOCKING. Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. Two FBI SUPERVISORS enter. Grim, silver-haired.

Microphones, water pitchers. \nSENIOR AGENT \nHave your rights been explained to you and has an indication to that effect been made in your employee record? \nGRACE \nYessir. \nINT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nGrace is exhausted, but holding up well.     The questions don't stop. \nSENIOR AGENT \nAgent Vanderholt. Why would Asher kill Ford, if nobody knew he was Costa. If he wasn't going to use Ford's identity? \nGRACE \nHe needed a murder he could link not only Richard Hart to but also to his past victims. \nFLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY \nUpscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone.        Shoves a gun in his belt and exits. \nGRACE (V.O.) \nHart's behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who won't pay. He had no idea he was being manipulated by a serial killer. \nINT. HART'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAsher enters through the front door.   Hart isn't home. \nINT. HART'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nAsher steals floss from the garbage can.   Takes Hart's toothbrush.

I miss you, too. I'm at the Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6 off Highway 29. Stop by. There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up. Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil. \nINT. ECONOMY MOTEL - DAY \nThe rising sun reveals Grace has not moved. She is now realizing Asher isn't going to show. Grace drops the .45 and begins to cry. \nEXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY \nGrace exits the clinic reading a test result.

POST OFFICE - NIGHT \nTen minutes later Grace checks her P.O. Box. Finds some baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN enters. \nPREGNANT WOMAN \nWow, you know the question? \nGRACE \nSix months. \nWIDER TO REVEAL: \nGrace is very pregnant. \nPREGNANT WOMAN \nThat's it? \nGRACE \nTwins. \nPREGNANT WOMAN \nGood luck, sweetheart. Get yourself home, it's miserable out. Grace smiles, exits. \nEXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT \nOld and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the ice. The only vehicle around. \nINT. GRACE'S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT \nThe accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) \nThe State Police have said to stay off the road unless it's an absolute emergency. Several of their cruisers have already been damaged. There is ice everywhere. On the way in tonight I saw the snowplow slipping and sliding. Everybody, stay where you are. This is only the beginning. Grace turns OFF the RADIO.     Turns on the defroster. \nSOMETHING MOVING. \nWHAM! \nHer WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS. A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her truck. The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain control, to keep it out of the ditch. Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood. \nEXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings. Grace pulls open a large garage door. Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice. Regains her feet, finishes opening the door. She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage. \nINT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY \nRestored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family that has decayed from glory. Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM. Then hangs up her heavy jacket. Bone tired. Grace crosses to the kitchen. \nINT.

Turns on the stove.         Grace notices water on the kitchen floor. Wait. Wet footprints. \nGrace REACTS.     Reaches for the Glock. A hand lands on top of her hand.      It's MARTIN ASHER. \nASHER \nHi, Grace. CLICK!   He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist. Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it. Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him. Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the cuffs. Asher catches his breath. \nASHER \n", "test1_input": "Good question.  Do we trust Costa? An unmarked car pulls up.     Reynaud drives. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nGet in. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY \nGrace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it.       Grace belts in. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nI found a current address here in Montreal. Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering through traffic. \nGRACE \nYou guys have an extra weapon? I didn't want to cross the border armed. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nThe glove box. Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it, shoves it into her pocket. Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving. A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets out. Then Grace. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nAn upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the attacker. \nSUPER \nI never met him. We conducted our business by phone. They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace stops him, listening at the door. \nGRACE \nI smell smoke. Back where I'm from anyone can kick a door if there's a fire. It's the 'citizen's arrest' of search warrants. Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S. Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg... The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows what she's doing. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nIt's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the kitchen. Light smoke. Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just pillows. Grace checks under the sink. Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower. A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom. Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one lurks in there. \nGRACE \nClear. Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window, whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing. \nGRACE \nUgh.   Got a lung full. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten plate of food on the table. \nGRACE \nLooks like this guy ran out in the middle of breakfast. Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks out the window, REACTS. \nWHAT GRACE SEES \nThe apartment window has a perfect view of the gym parking lot where the killing occurred. \nBACK TO SCENE \nReynaud sees that and also REACTS. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nWe should get out of here. Don't touch anything. They back out of there. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY (AN HOUR LATER) \nGrace watches a CRIMINALIST bag a comb from the medicine cabinet. A couple hairs entwined in its teeth. In the kitchen another CRIMINALIST dusts for prints. Reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera. Laval KNOCKS on the walls. Laval moves a picture frame. A photograph falls out. Laval picks it up with surgical gloves. INSERT PHOTO: A dead ringer for Costa's sketch, carousing in a Thai bar. Laval shows Grace. \nGRACE \nResembles the man Costa sketched. (beat) Have you released him? You don't want your star witness steaming in a holding cell. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nHe went home twenty minutes ago. Agent Grace, where do you think Monsieur Edwards is? \nGRACE \nI bet Monsieur Edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like Messieurs Kohler and Ford. Which looks like all the victims. Maybe he's subconsciously killing himself. Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized. Holiday cards. A CD titled: \"Learn Flamenco Guitar.\" Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents. Victim's personal effects. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nWe'll take that with us. (in French) Put a number and seal on that case. Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case. Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow. Thinking. \nGRACE \nEver see a Hermit crab? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nNo. \nGRACE \nIt's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYes, yes. They have one big claw and curl up tight. Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his jacket. Begins prying off a door molding. Grace sits at the kitchen table. \nGRACE \n", "test1_true": "(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE (CONT'D) \nThey live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies. They couldn't survive without the shells. Neither can the guy we're after. Laval exposes several MINI DV and MICRO-CASSETTES hidden under the molding. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN - DAY \nSurprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision lens. TODD FORD exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car. \nWIDEN TO: \nThe Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval watch the video on the TV. Director Gillet turns it off. He is not in a good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWe could have had him this morning. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nDirector, please. We are getting close. The hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered at the crime scene on Ford's body. We found hours of video like that of the victim. He has been following him, filming him for weeks. He tapped his phone and has recordings of Ford's calls. Even a CD with copies of Mr. Ford's E-mail folders. \nGRACE \nWith that much detail, you could become anyone. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nSo he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy. \nGRACE \nMore like a kind of camouflage. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nWhat's his real name? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nWe know what he looks like, we have his fingerprints, we know what he had for breakfast. But his name eludes us still. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \n(angry) Find it, Laval. Find him. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYes, sir. Laval and Reynaud quickly exit.     Grace stays. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nDirector Gillet and Grace walk down the hall. \nGRACE \nThey're working really hard. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nI know. \nGRACE \nSomeone died last night because the asshole we're after isn't in custody. It's happened to me before and I'm sure it will happen again. It's a pretty miserable feeling. \nDIRECTOR GILLET \nI haven't felt it in a long time. (a beat) Dinner? \nGRACE \nThank you. I promised the boys I'd hang out tonight. I'm sorry. \nINT. BISTRO - NIGHT \nGrace, Reynaud and Laval have mussels and beer.      Laval watches the GUITARIST, a little melancholy. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nI'm fair and I keep my promises. My informants trust me. I have eyes on the trains, on the buses. If they see him, they will tell me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \n(subtitled French) Maybe they will tell you. Why do you trust junkies? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \n(makes a fist) I trust their fear of this. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \n(subtitled French) Don't say that in front of her. \nGRACE \n(subtitled French) It's okay. I was a street cop in Philadelphia for three years before I joined the FBI. Grace speaks French.      Reynaud REACTS.    As does Laval. \n", "test2_input": "INSPECTOR REYNAUD \nVery nice.   You like to play games. Grace smiles. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nMr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship musician. He would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night. \nGRACE \nLife is pretty cold sometimes. Man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nHe targeted Mr. Ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in Aruba. \nGRACE \nOnly the new improved Mr. Ford was going to meet he ship. \nINSPECTOR REYNAUD \nThink he has a plan B? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nI doubt it. He's been so meticulous and effective in the past, I bet he's never needed one. We can assume he has all sorts of fake IDs and passports. Disguises. But that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else. He gets off impersonating people. And he knows his current persona is compromised. Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at her. \nGRACE \nWhat? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nYou're always thinking. Save something for tomorrow. We have three boxes of evidence to go through. \nGRACE \nPretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nMy papa dropped dead of a heart attack in front of a drill press at work. Not me. Grace understands.     Laval CLINKS her beer, Reynaud too. \nGRACE \nI'm dropping by Costa's, I still have a couple questions. (off Laval's look) I can't turn it off. \nEXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT \nA warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside. \nINT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT (MOS) \nJohn Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT WOMAN. She's laughing, flirting. Costa is making her laugh. \nEXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT \nGrace quickly crosses to the entrance. \nINT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT \nAn OLDER MAN joins them, the woman is his arm candy. Costa shakes his hand. The Older Man and the Elegant Woman exit. \nINT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nGrace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to see her. And that throws Grace a beat. She really likes his smile. \nGRACE \nMr. Costa. \nCOSTA \nYou caught me. \nGRACE \nNot yet. Grace looks over the art. \nCOSTA \nToussant Jean Bernard. I met him in Haiti last year. Very troubled life. Outlived all his children. And he had ten. He lost his wife to cancer and went blind. Passed away last year. \nGRACE \nOverpriced folk art. Is it the work of a soul that has suffered? Sure. Are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking? No. \nCOSTA \nOuch. And I was going to send you two and charge them to your Amex. \nGRACE \nI couldn't afford it. Costa is looking at her, looking through her. \nCOSTA \nWhat about Daddy's Amex? I've sold quite a bit of art to poor little rich girls like you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrace grows tense. \n", "test2_true": "Excuse me. \nCOSTA \nTry the wine. \nGRACE \nI'm partial to beer. And I don't have long. I came by to thank you for your help. And I apologize if you were detained. You did the right thing. Trying to save him. \nCOSTA \nWhy, thank you. Agent Vanderholt. (gives her a card) I'm having a show Friday. You should come by and meet some good people. \nGRACE \nWho knows.   Where'd you learn CPR? \nCOSTA \nMedical school. Before I dropped out. I had a moment of clarity: in anatomy class I realized I'd rather draw bodies than cut them up. And when I realized I couldn't make art, I decided to sell it. \nGRACE \nSome journey. \nCOSTA \nIt's taken me all over the world. \nGRACE \nAbout Monday again, did you see Mr. Ford fighting back? \nCOSTA \nAt first I thought I was interrupting something, you know? \nGRACE \nNo, I don't. \nCOSTA \nI thought they were hugging. Then the gun came out when he saw me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nI guess that's it. Thanks. Grace hands him a card. \nGRACE \nIf you remember any details or need anything. (off his look) Anything related to the case, please call me. \nCOSTA \nOkay. Think about Friday. Please, Grace? Grace will; she exits. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nGrace has turned the romantic little room into a cave of paperwork. Notes and photos cover the walls. Grace reads a phone bill taped to a lamp. Circles a number that keeps reappearing. \nINT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (6:03 A.M.) \nThe place is gearing up for a new day. Grace crosses to where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake with coffee and the morning paper. Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports section. A YOUNG DETECTIVE eats a grapefruit. \nGRACE \nMorning. Can you run this name? She got twenty hang-up calls from Edward's phone. The Young Detective takes a Post-It from Grace and crosses. \nGRACE \nWhat happened to that beautiful thumbprint on the orange juice glass, you get an ID? \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nNo hits. He's never been fingerprinted. \nGRACE \nShit. Any activity on Edward's accounts? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nNothing. I think he became Edwards a year ago. He was a software engineer. Did everything by the internet, he never met anyone face to face. Grace trades Reynaud for the front page. \nGRACE \nWhy a year ago. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nEdwards went on a river trip. Kohler was a guide. Grace REACTS.     Laval tosses her some papers. \nINSPECTOR LAVAL \nThose are E-mails between Kohler and Edwards discussing the trip one year ago. \nGRACE \nYou connected Edwards and Kohler? Somebody was working all night. \n", "test3_input": "GRACE \nThanks. \nCOSTA \nYou look a little anxious. \nGRACE \n(re: her dress) This isn't me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTA \nIt's all you. Grace gives Costa a look.       She sips her drink, nods at the painting. \nGRACE \nI'm trying to get into the show, but I mean. What is this? It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden. \nCOSTA \nMangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a branch. Now she sees it. \nGRACE \nOh. Okay. Why the borders? Almost every painting has one. Was he in prison or something? Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace. \nCOSTA \nMost people don't notice. This is from his prison series. He could see a mango grove through his cell window. He made some of the pigments himself. From flowers. From his own blood. \nGRACE \nWhat was his crime? \nCOSTA \nHe attacked his neighbor with a machete. There was a woman involved. \nGRACE \nAlways is. Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax.       She enjoys Costa's company. \nGRACE \nHe had a lot of lovers, didn't he? \nCOSTA \nDozens. He was a consumer of life's pleasures. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE \nNow he's dead and you get rich? \nCOSTA \nHis children formed a corporation, I take ten percent. I'm not a buccaneer, Grace. Grace looks at Costa and smiles. \nCOSTA \nWhat? \nGRACE \nI don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you. \nCOSTA \nYou're very sensitive for... \nGRACE \nAn FBI agent? The ELEGANT WOMAN spots Costa and crosses. She lays a hand on Costa's shoulder. He turns and they kiss cheeks. \nELEGANT WOMAN \nJohn, it's amazing tonight. I want to cry, I'm so touched. Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm. And is amazed that she feels jealous. She catches Costa's eye. \nGRACE \nMr. Costa, I would like to discuss an arrangement for the series. The Elegant Woman REACTS. \nELEGANT WOMAN \nJust a sec, John. She crosses to the Older Man in b.g.       Costa is miffed. \nCOSTA \nWhat are you doing? \nGRACE \nShe's not writing the checks. The Elegant Woman returns with the Older Man.       He grabs Costa's hand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOLDER MAN \n", "test3_true": "COSTA \nDick, they're yours. The Older Man smiles, shakes Costa's hand. The Elegant Woman looking at Grace, arms crossed, enjoys her victory. Grace plays along, stalks off, hiding a grin. \nINT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nA few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables looking through the DJ's records. \nGRACE \nDon't you miss wax? \nCOSTA \nYou helped me close the biggest sale of the night. \nGRACE \nWhat's my cut? \nCOSTA \nWhat do you want? Grace smiles coyly. \nGRACE \nI don't know. Costa looks at Grace for a long beat.      Not sure what her game is, or if he wants to play. \nCOSTA \nLet me know when you do.   Excuse me. Costa walks away.     Grace REACTS; she didn't want that. \nINT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCosta takes a leak.     He's in a good mood. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe window above the stalls is open. The noise of the PARTYING CROWD on the sidewalks outside. Costa finishes, washes his hands.        Pauses.    Smoothes his hair. \nSOMEONE BEHIND HIM \nCosta looks in the mirror and REACTS. MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who it is. Asher is wound tight, not at all happy. \nASHER \nPut your hands on the wall. Asher jams a gun in Costa's back.        Costa is very scared. \nASHER \nFeel that? \nCOSTA \nPlease be cool with that.    I don't wanna get hurt. \nASHER \nI should blow your spine out. My face is everywhere. I have to hide in the shadows like a fucking animal because of you. \nCOSTA \nYessir. I apologize for everything you think I may have done. \nASHER \nWe're moved past sorry. You ruined everything. John, soon to be dead, Costa. Asher's eyes flash. WHAM! Asher slams Costa's face into the mirror. Costa's nose bleeds. \nCOSTA \nStop it! \nINT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nReynaud stands near the bathroom. He heard that.          He approaches the door, tests the knob. \nINT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe door opens. Costa hits the deck. Asher spins, aims at Reynaud and FIRES. POP-POP-POP-POP! Reynaud drops and rolls out of the line of fire. \nINT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nAsher bursts from the bathroom, running right over Reynaud, who draws his pistol. Grace pulls a pistol, Laval too. Asher running through the patrons. Grace takes a knee and aims. She doesn't have a clear shot. Asher aims his gun straight ahead as he runs. People hit the deck. \nASHER \nOut of my way! POP! Asher SHOOTS a WINDOW, SHATTERING it. He shoulders his way through the safety glass. Grace and Laval follow. \nEXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT \nChaos. Summerfest is in full swing. A swirling, boiling CROWD of shiny faces. Asher dives into their midst. Grace plunges in after him. Inspector Laval follows. \nINT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCosta is stunned, Reynaud checks him for bullet holes. \nCOSTA \nI'm okay. From Reynaud's radio: \nINSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.) \n(filtered, subtitled French) Jean, he ran into the damn crowd. Reynaud bolts out of there. \nEXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT \nAsher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed REVELERS that Reynaud follows. Asher running. Careening, rolling, bouncing off PEOPLE. He has the tireless power of a soccer player. \n"}

The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is still split. 
MOM HALL How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer? 
DAD HALL Fast? 
ALVY'S FATHER Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to atone for our sins. 
MOM HALL What sins?  I don't understand. 
ALVY'S FATHER Tell you the truth, neither do we. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT 
Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door. 
DUANE Alvy. 
ALVY (Walking in) Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'? 
DUANE This is my room. 
ALVY (Looking around) Oh, yeah? (He clears his throat) Terrific. 
DUANE Can I confess something? 
Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser.  Duane's face is big lighted by a single lamp. 
DUANE I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand.  Sometimes when I'm driving ... on the road at night ... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast.  I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car.  I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The ... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline. 
ALVY (Reacting and clearing his throat) Right.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth. 
He slowly gets up and moves toward the door. 
INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM. 
Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them. 
MOM HALL Now, don't let it be so long, now. 
ANNIE No. 
DAD HALL And look up Uncle Bill, you promise. 
ANNIE Okay.  Okay. 
MOM HALL Oh, he's adorable, Annie. 
ANNIE You think so?  Do you really? 
MOM HALL We're going to take them to the airport. DAD HALL Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished my drink. 
ANNIE Yes, Duane is.  I'll be right- 
MOM HALL M'mmm. 
ANNIE I just have time to get the, uh- 
She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead.  It is raining very hard, the windshield wipers are moving quickly.  The headlights of another car brightens the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then Alvy tensely staring straight ahead. 
EXT. STREET- DAY 
The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame. 
ANNIE (Off screen) You followed me.  I can't believe it! 
ALVY (Off screen) I didn't follow you! 
ANNIE You followed me! 
ALVY Why?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following! 
ANNIE Well, what is your definition of following? 
ALVY (Gasping) Following is different.  I was spying. 
ANNIE Do you realize how paranoid you are? 
ALVY Paranoid?  I'm looking at you.  You got your arms around another guy.

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants, shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of slices. 
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight. 
NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine. 
EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT 
No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind. 
NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel. The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face is not visible. 
As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and disappears. 
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY 
Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going. In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping. 
CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice, milk and a little box of Wheaties. 
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY 
Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive, tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE. 
MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something. 
EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY 
NICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts toward the building. 
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY 
MERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without expression, then MERLE continues down the stairs. 
EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY 
NICK is pushing SAL down a walkway. 
NICK Sal, we need you. We need you. 
SAL Hey, Nick. How can you need me? 
NICK We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart. 
Turns SAL and sits on a bench. 
NICK (CONT'D) Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it! 
SAL Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home. 
NICK (nods) I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars. 
SAL laughs. 
SAL Did you go hunting. 
NICK Yeah. 
SAL Did you get one? 
NICK No. 
SAL You didn't get a deer? 
NICK I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here? 
SAL Where? 
NICK Here. Behind you. 
NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair. 
SAL I don't know. 
NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the clasps. 
NICK Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I know she said -- 
The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

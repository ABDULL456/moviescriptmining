EDWARD (turning on the charm) Yes! 
THE MAN Will we see you at the polo matches Wednesday? 
EDWARD Wouldn't miss it. (abruptly; to Vance) I want this done fast and easy. No slip-ups.  I want to be back in New York by Saturday.  Got it? 
He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd. 
INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 
Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress.  An elegant woman ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on the shoulder and he turns, startled. 
ELIZABETH Bill? 
STUCKEY (flustered) Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent, uh, uh, Millicent. 
MILLICENT Lowell. 
STUCKEY Lowell, right.  My wife, Elizabeth. 
ELIZABETH (ignoring her) Is Edward leaving? 
Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door. Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward. 
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Edward comes out of the house.  Jags, a limo with waiting DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black Ferrari.  The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of Edward.  Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his impatience under control.  Stuckey comes out of the house and down the walk. 
STUCKEY What's up, where you going? 
EDWARD Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel. 
STUCKEY At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you. 
EDWARD Apologize to Elizabeth for me. 
Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys. 
STUCKEY Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you... 
EDWARD (as if delighted) Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? (turning away) No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one. 
STUCKEY Cynthia's not coming? 
EDWARD No. 
Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.  He crosses to a black Ferrari and gets in. 
STUCKEY Let your driver take you.  We'll move the cars... 
Edward starts the car. 
STUCKEY Can you drive a stick? 
The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly stalls. 
STUCKEY Edward, give me a break! 
With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway and... stalls again. 
EDWARD Love this car!  Is it new? 
STUCKEY Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going! 
Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.  Stuckey watching, throws up his hands. 
STUCKEY That's the wrong way! 
CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears... 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt. The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly. Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.  The light turns green.  Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.  The Colt leaves him in the dust. 
INT. FERRARI - NIGHT 
Edward drives.  He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid himself of his own tired thoughts.

MARK Do you have any experience, son? 
CHARLES Not really. 
RONNIE Um, sir, I have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. The kid kind of looks up to me. I'm some what of a big brother to the little guy. 
Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy. 
MARK Alright, it's actually not a bad idea. It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this. 
Ronnie winks at Charles. 
CHARLES Thank you, Mark. 
MARK Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go. I mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall. You're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly, I just bought my wife a new Cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE With Charles on my team, I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week. 
Mark laughs to himself. 
RONNIE Why'd you just laugh? 
MARK It's nothing.    Have fun, Ronnie. 
Ronnie looks at Charles. 
RONNIE Did I say something funny? 
CHARLES Let's go, Ronnie. 
Ronnie and Charles take off. 
INT. MALL - DAY 
Ronnie and Charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the "mall walkers." 
CHARLES Be careful, guys. Nice and slow. 
RONNIE That's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice. Watch this. Slow it down! Slow it down! You've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second! (back to Charles) See, you can't be intimidated. You have to make them respect you. 
CHARLES Ronnie, you know I really want to thank you for the job. You're a man of your word. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE No problem, my young student. So, I got something to tell you. Keep this between us until it's official, but I don't think I'm going to be here for much longer. 
CHARLES You're quitting? But you love this job. 
RONNIE I do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force. 
CHARLES The real police? 
RONNIE They're calling me up. It's basically a done deal. Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun. 
CHARLES I didn't even know you wanted to become a Cop. 
RONNIE It's always been my job. The Mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations. Some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others. 
CHARLES Congrats, brother. 
RONNIE (to a mall walker) HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY! 
A Mall Walker slows her pace.        She turns around and Ronnie sees that it's Nell. 
RONNIE Nell? 
NELL Hey, Ronnie. 
RONNIE What are you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NELL Nothing, just getting in shape. 
RONNIE Well, that's okay, I guess.   Just watch your speed, okay? 
Nell waves and walks on. 
CHARLES Isn't that your girlfriend? 
RONNIE Ex. 
CHARLES She looked good.

Kicking Bird reaches out and feels the strange material on either side of Wind In His Hair's chest. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR I traded for it. 
KICKING BIRD Does it scratch the skin? 
WIND IN HIS HAIR A little. But do you see how good it looks. Everyone says it looks good. Everyone. 
EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT 
Dunbar keeps to the shadows as he makes his way through camp. Now he slows his step. 
Light from another fire is spilling into his path. There's music too. And singing. The voices are high and feminine. 
Dunbar peers around a lodge. A group of young women are dancing in a clockwise circle. Their steps are light-hearted. This is dancing purely for the fun of it. 
One of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge and there's a wave of shy giggling as news of "loo ten tant's" presence is passed along. Embarrassed, Dunbar starts along the fringe of the fires, nodding politely to the women as he goes. 
One has more courage than the others. She breaks out, takes his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle. Whatever resistance he might have is buried by the girl's insistent encouragement. She keeps showing him the step and the lieutenant tries to pick it up. 
The movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing. Awkward at first, Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it. In short order, he's keeping up with the others. And he's enjoying himself. 
Soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes, carried along by the eternal sound of the drums. He doesn't notice that the circle has begun to shrink. There is a touch of the devil in their eyes. 
He bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him. But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar. It was a pleasant accident. But quickly there's another accident. And then all their bodies are squeezing against his. The girls are murmuring good things to him. Their hands are touching him everywhere. 
It's okay with Dunbar. Everybody's having a good time. The drumming suddenly stops however, and the women scatter away from the fire, leaving Dunbar suddenly alone. Kicking Bird is standing not far off. 
DUNBAR They asked me to dance... 
The medicine man says nothing. 
DUNBAR I was just dancing... 
The lieutenant does a step or two, trying to explain. Finally, that strange half-smile appears on Kicking Bird's face. 
EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT 
Stands With A Fist has been watching everything from the tipi flap. Now she ducks back inside. 
INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT 
The fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. Dunbar is sleeping soundly. 
It's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of mumbling somewhere in the lodge. Then it's quiet. There's that mumbling again. And now a woman's giggle. 
Dunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks across the fire. There is movement on Kicking Bird's platform. The medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow. The movements and sound that follow become more forceful. They're having sex. 
Embarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen over the forms of Kicking Bird's deeply sleeping children, the low-burning fire, and settle on Stands With A Fist's back. 
Lieutenant Dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife. 
Embarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. He looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't know what it is. 
Stands With A Fist's eyes are open too. She doesn't move. 
EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN 
The faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the eastern horizon. 
EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN 
The camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon. 
It's the pony herd. And Dunbar is walking in that direction. His feet leave a trail in the wet grass. 
First one, then two, then whole groups of ponies lift their heads and prick their ears at Dunbar's approach. 
Dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses, he stops and gives a long whistle. 
A figure, previously unseen, sits up on the back of a pony. It's Smiles A Lot. He and Dunbar glance blankly at each other. But in a moment, both are distracted by movement in the herd. 
Horses are being gently eased out of the way by Cisco who is answering Dunbar's call. A moment later and they are reunited at the edge of the herd. 
Grasping a hunk of Cisco's mane, Dunbar starts to lead him back to the village. The temporary camp is starting to come to life. And with Cisco at his side, Dunbar pauses to take in the scene. 
EXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK 
An escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp. Dunbar looks on, a travois of meat next to him and gives a last wave. 
DUNBAR (V.O.) To stay any longer would've been useless. We had all the meat we could possibly carry. We had hunted for three days, losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured. Many times I have felt alone but until this afternoon, I have never felt completely lonely. 
INT. QUARTERS - DAY 
The person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance to the Lieutenant Dunbar we've known. 
His long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. His skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe breastplate covers his torso. 
Dunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. It is clear that as Lieutenant Dunbar, he can find nothing to say. He lays the pen down momentarily. 
DUNBAR (V.O.) Made a long patrol today. There is nothing to report. The truth is I am bored. 
There is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws. His eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. Watching the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with mice. 
Restlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old fort. The awning is beginning to tear at the corner. And then he spots something. 
EXT. QUARTERS - DAY 
A large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters. Dunbar squats next to it. It's neck carries punctures, and when he dabs a finger on the wounds, he finds that the blood is still wet. The lieutenant rises slowly, his sharp eyes sweeping the fort. 
He's waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff overlooking the river. Two Socks. 
Dunbar smiles and shakes his head. Watching his old friend, he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that suggests he's had some experience.

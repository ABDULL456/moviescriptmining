ADRIAN (CONT'D) I want to know who's behind this! The Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him, unanswered. He looks over at Dan, frustrated. 
INT. CAFE - AFTERNOON 
Dan and Laurie sit in the back of the cafe, making sure they have privacy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAURIE Oh my god. Where's Adrian now? 
DAN Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him 
(BEAT) What about you? What are you going to do? 
LAURIE I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me. 
DAN Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place? 
LAURIE Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose-- 
DAN It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening 
LAURIE You're buying into Rorschach's "mask killer" theory? 
DAN I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles. 
LAURIE Okay. 
(BEAT) So this guy who tried to kill Adrian--who was he? 
INT. LIVING ROOM - APARTMENT - SAME TIME 
DAN (V.0.) Some local low-life named Roy Chess 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy. Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards-- --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a security guard . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries. Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries. Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE 
DIRECTORY. Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types in a name: "Jane Slater." A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED." Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
We're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his mask on. 
RORSCHACH (V.O.) Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: "Tonight 11:30, M." 
RORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster. 
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Still in his POV, we watch him put each article on. Then he pulls out his MASK. 
RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) . my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN 
INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S EYES staring fearfully out the rainy window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him. 
RORSCHACH Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE. 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead. Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU." Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
DET. FINE (O.S.) (over LOUDSPEAKERS) 
RORSCHACH, THIS IS THE POLICE! 
RORSCHACH No. 
DET. FINE (O.S.) 
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

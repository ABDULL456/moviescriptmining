KOMIYA Here you are. 
ASAKAWA (taking the folder) Thanks. 
Komiya has a seat. 
KOMIYA This same kind of thing happened about ten years ago too, didnt it? Some popular young singer committed suicide, and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show. 
ASAKAWA But I wonder what this rumors all about. Everyone you ask always mentions Izu. 
KOMIYA Maybe thats where it all started. Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again? 
>* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful? then >lowering her veil to reveal her true features. 
ASAKAWA Gifu, but there was some big accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor. 
KOMIYA A big accident? 
ASAKAWA Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like that is going to stay in peoples minds.  Sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one. Thats what they say, at least. 
KOMIYA Dyou think something like that happened out at Izu? 
ASAKAWA Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you tomorrow. 
KOMIYA See you. 
Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit. She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY EDITIONS. 
She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story: 
STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA 
The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a private all-girls high school. Because there were no external injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced suicide... 
Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES. 
GUY IN SUIT OK, Okazaki, Im counting on you. 
OKAZAKI Yessir. 
The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off. 
Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table and peering intently at the newspaper article. 
OKAZAKI Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were going home early today. 
Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

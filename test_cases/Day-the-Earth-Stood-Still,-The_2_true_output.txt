MRS. CROCKETT Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here to see you. 
HELEN Oh -- thank you. 
She rises and goes out. 
MRS. BARLEY Finish your coffee, George. I told the Carsons we'd be there at eleven. 
INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy. 
HELEN (smiling warmly) Good morning. 
Tom kisses her. 
TOM We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today. 
HELEN (a little disturbed) There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. (tentatively) I don't suppose we could take him with us? 
TOM (understandably unenthusiastically) Well, we could-- 
HELEN There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans. 
KLAATU'S VOICE I haven't any plans. 
Helen and Tom turn in surprise. 
THREE SHOT 
including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere. 
KLAATU I'd be glad to spend the day with him -- if you'd let me. 
TOM (impulsively) Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, Helen. 
HELEN (hesitating, a little confused, by the offer) It's awfully nice of you to suggest it. (remembering the two men haven't met) I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is Tom Stevens. 
The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then Klaatu turns back to Helen. 
KLAATU Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon. We talked -- and listened to the radio. (smiling at Helen) I thought today he might show me around the city. 
Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because of her favorable impression of Klaatu. 
KLAATU (easily) Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it. 
He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a questioning look. Tom nods. 
DISSOLVE T0: 
INT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - FULL SHOT - DAY (STOCK) 
The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far end of the impressive main hall. A few tourists are moving about the place. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY 
They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed the Gettysburg Address. They stand silently, side by side, reading the inscription. 
INSERT - GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (STOCK) 
Featuring the last part of the Address. It reads: "--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." 
TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY 
KLAATU (visibly impressed) Those are great words. (with an air of discovery) He must have been a great man. 
Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered Lincoln. Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY 
shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu and Bobby come out of the building. Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu speaks with impatient urgency. 
KLAATU That's the kind of man I'd like to talk to.

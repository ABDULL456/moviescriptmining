OLBRICHT You can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front- 
STAUFFENBERG I'm a soldier, General. I serve my country. 
OLBRICHT It makes no sense. You opposed Hitler, you opposed the war. 
STAUFFENBERG The people chose otherwise and here we are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don't. 
OLBRICHT If we win, it will still be Hitler's Germany. 
STAUFFENBERG We all took an oath, General. 
Olbricht nods, resigning. He realizes it is no use. Finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to reveal a brilliant gold medal. 
OLBRICHT On behalf of the FÃ¼hrer. 
Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it. 
STAUFFENBERG I'm a twin, you know. 
Olbricht is as confused as we are. 
OLBRICHT I... I didn't. 
STAUFFENBERG My brother died the day after we were born. 
OLBRICHT I'm sorry. 
What the hell is he talking about? 
STAUFFENBERG I was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my children... But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again... 
He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) This is my reward for what happened to my men. It's all I deserve. 
Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan. 
18   INT. HOSPITAL - CRITICAL WARD - DAY                       18 
CLOSE ON: A field of white. A three fingered hand enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to the one just saw. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER. 
AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals. 
PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so with reverence. The ward is eerily silent. 
With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch. 
Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs gone, his face smashed. 
CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a familiar clicking of heels and: 
19   INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER                         19 
Stauffenberg's boots pound the floor as he rushes for the door, desperate to get out, barely able to breathe. At first he does not hear: 
VOICE (O.S.) Colonel... COLONEL. 
A hand grabs his shoulder. Stauffenberg turns, ready to strike. He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a small, square box. Another sort medal perhaps? 
STAUFFENBERG I don't want the damn th- 
The Doctor opens the box to reveal: 
A GLASS EYEBALL sitting atop a layer of satin, staring blankly back at Stauffenberg. Creepy. 
DOCTOR When will you be going back to the front? 
Beat. Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball. 
STAUFFENBERG I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin. 
20   EXT. BERLIN - NIGHT                                     20

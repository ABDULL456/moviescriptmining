Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed. 
KEYES And the stuff that came out. She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen. And there was a manic- depressive in her family, on her mother's side. And she already had one husband, a professional pool player in Baltimore. And as for her brother -- 
NEFF I get the general idea. She was a tramp from a long line of tramps. 
He picks up some papers impatiently. 
KEYES All right, I'm going. What am I to say to Norton? How about that job I want you for? 
NEFF I don't think I want it. Thanks, Keyes, just the same. 
KEYES Fair enough. Just get this: I picked you for the job, not because I think you're so darn smart, but because I thought maybe you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit. I guess I was all wet. You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller. 
He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. 
He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm. 
NEFF'S VOICE That was it, Keyes, and there was no use kidding myself any more. Those fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off. Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed. The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it. The time for thinking had all run out. From here on it was a question of following the time table, move by move, just as we had it rehearsed. I wanted my time all accounted for for the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening. So I arranged to call on a prospect in Pasadena about a public liability bond. When I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it. That was part of the alibi. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
B-29 EXT. NEFF'S APT. HOUSE DAY 
Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement. 
NEFF'S VOICE I got home about seven and drove right into the garage. This was another item to establish my alibi. 
B-30 INT. GARAGE 
There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm. 
ATTENDANT Hiya there, Mr. Neff. 
NEFF How about a wash job on my heap, Charlie? 
ATTENDANT How soon you want it, Mr. Neff? I got two cars ahead of you. 
NEFF Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm staying in tonight. 
ATTENDANT Okay, Mr. Neff. Be all shined up for you in the morning. 
Neff is crossing to the elevator. He speaks back over his shoulder: 
NEFF That left front tire looks a little soft. Check it, will you? 
ATTENDANT You bet. Check 'em all round. Always do. 
Neff enters the elevator. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
B-31 NEFF'S APT. - (DAY) 
Neff enters. He walks straight to the phone, dials, and starts speaking into the mouthpiece, but only the COMMENTARY is heard. 
DISSOLVE: 
NEFF'S VOICE Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz, one of the salesmen that shared my office. He lived in Westwood. That made it a toll call and there'd be a record of it. I told him I had forgotten my rate book and needed some dope on the public liability bond I was figuring. I asked him to call me back. This was another item in my alibi, so that later on I could prove that I had been home. 
B-32 INT. NEFF'S LIVING ROOM 
Neff comes into the living room from the bedroom, putting on the jacket of his blue suit. THE PHONE RINGS. He picks up the receiver and starts talking, unheard, as before. He makes notes on a pad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
NEFF'S VOICE I changed into a navy blue suit like Dietrichson was going to wear. Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures... 
B-33 NEFF 
He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
NEFF'S VOICE (Cont'd) I stuffed a hand towel and a big roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, so I could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg... Next I fixed the telephone and the doorbell, so that the cards would fall down if the bells rang. That way I would know there had been a phone call or visitor while I was away. I left the apartment house by the fire stairs and side door. Nobody saw me. It was already getting dark. I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los Feliz and walked from there up to the Dietrichson house. There was that smell of honeysuckle again, only stronger, now that it was evening. 
B-34 & B-35 INSERTS OF OPEN TELEPHONE BELL BOX (ON BASEBOARD) & DOORBELL (ABOVE ENTRANCE DOOR) 
Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these.

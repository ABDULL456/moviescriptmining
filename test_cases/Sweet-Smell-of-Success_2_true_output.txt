Susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street.  Sidney comes behind her, watchful as he overtakes her near the doors.  He goes past her to open the door for her. 
SIDNEY I'll get you a cab... 
Susan stops dead. 
SUSAN (coldly) Get away from me. 
She goes out into the street.  Beyond, we see a crushing cab. Hesitating, Sidney adds: 
SIDNEY J.J. asked me to drive you over and - 
But Susan has already moved out of shot, hurrying across the sidewalk to hail the taxi. 
RESUME SIDNEY 
Uncertain what to do, whether to follow her or not, he moves after her. 
SUSAN 
She has already opened the door of the taxi.  She turns to see Sidney come up behind her.  As he enters SHOT, she repeats: 
SUSAN I told you to leave!  I don't know if Steve'll ever talk to me again and I'm ready to blame it all on you! 
She starts to get into the cab... 
SIDNEY 
Alert, he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the extent of her suspicion.) 
SIDNEY Susie...! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As Sidney steps up, he grasps at the door of the taxi, trying to hold it open, but Susan pulls it shut, catching his fingers in the door.  Sidney steps back in pain... 
TAXI 
It drives off down Sixth Avenue. 
SIDNEY 
Nursing the injury to his hand, he looks after the disappearing taxi.  As he recovers from the pain, his expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal. (Susan's suspicions maybe of less importance than some other considerations.) 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB WASHROOM - NIGHT 
Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins.  Coat off, the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence. Sidney, despite his throbbing, bandaged finger, is feeling satisfied and self-confident.  He hums quietly.  Hunsecker throws him annoyed side-glances, but Sidney refuses to "catch on".  The following dialogue is spaced between the washing, the drying and hair-combing. 
HUNSECKER So that's what "integrity" looks like.  Well, I'm always willing to learn... (later) How is that slob, D'Angelo, your uncle? 
Sidney no longer hums; after a moment, he answers. 
SIDNEY My mother's side--her brother. That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks run down.  She can stand a vacation and so can you.  People say, "Oh, the great J.J., he's made of iron!", but you can use a rest, guy. 
Sidney's cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker. 
HUNSECKER What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard! 
SIDNEY (smiling) But not for anything I did today... 
HUNSECKER Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again. 
Hunsecker moves out of shot. 
SIDNEY You're right, J.J. - she won't give him up, but it doesn't matter. Because the real "money ball" is the boy, not Susan.  And if -- 
Hearing the sound of the door, Sidney turns sharply.  CAMERA MOVES to discover that Hunsecker has gone out.  Sidney, quickly, finishing the brushing of his hair, follows... 
INT. DINING ROOM - "21" CLUB 
Two waiters are fussing over Hunsecker's table at which places are already set for Sidney and Hunsecker.  Matre d' hands him an envelope as he passes. 
MATRE D' Mr. Hunsecker this was to be delivered to you personally - 
When the columnist comes up to the table, the waiters quickly pull out the table for him.  Sidney comes to join him; Sidney gets some attention, but considerably less. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER. 
HUNSECKER These drinks are warm. 
WAITER You said you like to have them on your table. 
HUNSECKER What are you a critic? 
WAITER I'll change -- 
HUNSECKER Forget it. (to Sidney) The real money ball is the boy... 
SIDNEY Yeah, the boy...we're on the verge of a farce, a real farce.  As I see it, if Susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat. But since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not going to be able to take it. 
A waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at Hunsecker's elbow. 
HUNSECKER (to waiter) Stop tinkering, pal - that horse radish won't jump a fence! 
The waiter retreats rapidly. 
SIDNEY In brief, J.J., it's all over because any hour now the boy will give her up.  Is it a farce or not? 
Delicately salting his oysters, Hunsecker looks obliquely at Sidney. 
HUNSECKER This syrup you're giving out, Sidney, you pour over waffles, not J.J. Hunsecker!  What do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister? 
Hunsecker, with a casual gesture, tugs lightly at the end of Sidney's tie. 
Hunsecker's gesture is playful, but it inflicts great injury to Sidney's dignity; Sidney cannot bear to be touched; he finds this liberty on J.J.'s part as intolerable as anything he has experienced, and only with great difficulty controls himself.  The SHOT FAVORS Sidney. 
SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER 
Hunsecker continues: 
HUNSECKER Are you listening? 
SIDNEY (warily) How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and - 
HUNSECKER 
From Sidney's viewpoint.  Without turning, Hunsecker interrupts:

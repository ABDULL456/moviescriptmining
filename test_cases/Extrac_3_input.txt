EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT 
Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday Inn. 
INT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS 
Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on a stool. 
JOEL I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV. 
DEAN Why don't you do that in another bathroom. You've got three of 'em. 
JOEL It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in... 
DEAN Insulation?... All I know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house. I mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company. I can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that. 
JOEL But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass. 
(MORE) 
JOEL (CONT'D) I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do. 
DEAN (trying to help) Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment. 
JOEL Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV. 
INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY 
CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something vulnerable and sweet about her as well. Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired, goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each other trying to help her. 
SALESMAN #1 Yeah, it's expensive but it's sweet... Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups? 
CINDY No, sorry. I don't play. It's for my Dad actually -- for his fiftieth birthday. My sisters and I are all pitching in. 
SALESMAN #2 Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would love these humbuckings. They really kick ass. An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy, trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible. He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side. 
MALE CUSTOMER Excuse me... I just have a quick question... Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy. 
SALESMAN #2 
(OBLIVIOUS) So, what kind of music did he play? Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard room. 
CINDY I think he played like, jazz or something. I'm not sure. 
SALESMAN #2 Well this is an excellent jazz guitar. It's what Pat Metheny plays. 
SALESMAN #1 Is your Dad into Metheny at all? 
CINDY Oh, I don't know who that is. Sorry. 
SALESMAN #2 He's like, a totally kickass fusion guitarist. Are you into fusion? 
CINDY I don't really know much about it... 
SALESMAN #2 I play fusion guitar so... Just curious. 
CINDY Um, do they come in any other colors? 
SALESMAN #1 You mean different finishes? There's a sunburst finish we might have in stock.

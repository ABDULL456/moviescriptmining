RICK COLEMAN I hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief. Maggie's Father LAUGHS. 
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) Hey, everyone's coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue- -why don't you join us? 
MAGGIE Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home. 
MAGGIE'S FATHER Your mom and I will take 'em home. You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week. Grace perks up at this. 
MAGGIE Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really 
HADN'T PLANNED-- 
GRACE Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Grace pulls Maggie aside. 
GRACE (CONT'D) 
(WHISPERING) What's your problem? 
MAGGIE Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married. 
GRACE To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage. So remind me again--who are we married to? Maggie thinks about this. 
MAGGIE Well...I guess one beer won't kill us. 
GRACE 
(SMILING) That's my girl. Grace glances over at the ballplayers. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Why shouldn't we have fun? God knows our guys are living it up. 
CUT TO: 
A CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD 
HOG-HEAD What would you guys rather do--make- out with a guy or let him blow you? PULL BACK TO REVEAL that... 
INT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS 
.Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight. 
HOG-HEAD (CONT'D) And you've gotta pick one or someone in your family will die-- that's the rule. 
GARY Oh boy, that's a toughie. 
FRED How long would you have to make-out with him? 
HOG-HEAD Ten minutes. 
RICK Tongue? 
HOG-HEAD Of course. 
FRED And how long would he have to blow you? 
HOG-HEAD Seven minutes. 
GARY Oof. I mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so.. .intimate. 
RICK You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy? 
GARY Way more. 
BAKER All right, the hell with this shit, I'm outta here. Baker gets up from his stool. 
RICK 
(TAKEN ABACK) What? Why? 
BAKER I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks. 
FRED Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time. 
GARY Baker's right. This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl. 
RICK 
(POINTED) That's not exactly accurate, Gary. Thanks to your scrumptious brownies, I did spend half of last night talking to Judy on the drug- and-poison hotline. Hog-head and Gary stand. 
HOG-HEAD I guess I'm gonna get going, too. 
GARY Yeah, this is boring. You guys are pussies. 
FRED Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk to any girls. 
BAKER We don't have hall passes! 
(SHAKES HEAD) Come on, guys, let's go. The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and turns.

ALICE No! (dials it down) A misunderstanding. We're fine. She's fine. 
(TO EMMA) You're fine, right? 
EMMA Super fine. 
ALICE Richard, we've got to-- (sighs, in love) I can't believe you're here--! 
MEG 
But, we've got a little situation-- 
EMMA (grabbing Alice's arm) It'll just take a minute! We'll have her right back! 
MEG Don't worry about a thing! 
RICHARD (holds up newspaper) Like this? 
ALICE 
(KISSES RICHARD) I'll explain everything! I promise! They take off for the elevator. 
EMMA Boy! Does he love you.

(GLEEFUL) Did you see he fixed my suitcase? 
EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAY 
Nikolai rings the doorbell. 
CORDELIA (O.S.) Oh, thank god! Cordelia opens the door to Nikolai, who holds out the room key and flower with a smile as her brows come together. 
NIKOLAI Lechu k tebe na krylyah lyubvi. 
CORDELIA Security? They look at each other in confusion, Nikolai's smile fading, Cordelia with mounting alarm. She slams the door in his face. At the end of the hall, the elevator doors open for Alice, 
Emma and Meg, as Nikolai removes the necklace from his pocket and reaches to ring the suite's bell again. 
EMMA Niki! 
ALICE The necklace! 
MEG Don't touch that bell! They race down the hall towards Nikolai, who gapes, perplexed by the sight of Emma. 
EMMA Oh, Niki! I knew it! I knew it! I believed in you the whole time!

CORDELIA (CONT'D) In the Grimaldi Suite at the Hotel de Paris. You must come straight away. I've been robbed! And now some horrible, foreign man--! I believe someone is trying to kill me!

Emma kisses Nikolai as she pushes him onto the elevator. 
EMMA Wait for me in the lobby, sweetie. Down in half a second-- 
NIKOLAI Ya tebya lyublyu. 
EMMA I know. Me, too. The doors close and Emma sprints back down the hall to Alice and Meg at the door. 
EMMA (CONT'D) Okay! Do it! Alice rings the bell. 
INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY 
Cordelia approaches the door cautiously and spies through the peep hole at the back of Meg's head. 
CORDELIA Yes? Who is it? 
MEG (voice dropped low) Security, Madame. 
CORDELIA Finally--! She opens the door. A beat where Cordelia focuses on Alice and Meg first, possibly remembering them, then she registers Emma. She blinks, completely nonplussed. 
ALICE We can explain.

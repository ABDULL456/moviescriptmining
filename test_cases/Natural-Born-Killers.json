{"train": "\"Natural Born Killers\", early, by Quentin Tarantino \n\"NATURAL BORN KILLERS\" \nWRITTEN BY \nQUENTIN TARANTINO \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nA coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF SCREEN. \nMABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup. \nMICKEY What kind of pies do you have? \nMABEL Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime. \nMICKEY Which do you recommend? \nMABEL The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste. \nMICKEY I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years. \nMABEL When ya had it, did ya like it? \nMICKEY No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk. \nMabel turns to her right. \nMABEL (to someone O.S.) Should I make that two pieces? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX, Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back is to the camera as well. \nMALLORY Nada, Rosey. \nMABEL (annoyed) My name's not Rosey. (points at name tag) It's Mabel. \nMabel exits FRAME. \nMALLORY Whatever. \nMallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter. \nMABEL Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'? \nMallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes follow Mallory, he loses his ball. \nShe walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop. \nMabel brings Mickey his pie and milk. \nMABEL (to Mickey) She ought not be doing that. That's for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll. \nCAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie: \nMICKEY I can't take her anywhere. \nMallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. She's really cooking and smoking. \nPinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are. \nMickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his pie and milk. \nEXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nA dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood. \nEARL Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot. Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er out. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nThe LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks. \nSONNY Good God almighty. What the hell is that? \nOTIS That's a bitch outta hell, son. \nOtis and Sonny exchange looks. \nSONNY Take a run at 'er, kiddo. \nOtis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next to Mickey. \nSONNY Miller, Mabel. \nMickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville. Duane Eddy's 'REBEL ROUSER' blares on the soundtrack. The B.G. is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this image 50's style. \nWhen this sequence is over, we CUT TO BLACK. \nEND CREDIT SEQUENCE \nOver black screen, we hear: \nCAPTAIN SQUERI Send Scagnetti in here. \nINT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY \nCAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in the middle of the frame. \nJACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's office. Squeri's never seen. \nSCAGNETTI You wanted to see me, Capt'n? \nCAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.) Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the prison board, is waiting to meet you. You're gonna deliver two prisoners from the county jail to Nystrom Insane Asylum in Bakersfield. \nSCAGNETTI This is bullshit. I'm a detective. You want an errand boy, call Jerry Lewis. \nScagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him. \nCAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.) Jack! \nINT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY \nPolice Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway, wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket. \nPEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already tied tie over his head. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY \nDEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit, stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door. In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room. \nSCAGNETTI Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me? \nMcClusky turns toward Scagnetti. \nMCCLUSKY Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank. \nSCAGNETTI Thank you, sir. \nMCCLUSKY Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please. \nScagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation table. \nMCCLUSKY (referring to book) This is damn good reading. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't found you. This would make a better movie than that 'Serpico' shit. \nMcClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti. McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap. \nMCCLUSKY I think you'll find that good reading as well. Mickey and Mallory's file. You familiar with them? \nScagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up. \nSCAGNETTI Who isn't? \nMCCLUSKY You been followin' the news coverage? \nSCAGNETTI They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries--- \nMCCLUSKY Susanville, Soledade. \nSCAGNETTI They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards--- \nMCCLUSKY Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines. \nScagnetti nods. \nMCCLUSKY Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out. \nSCAGNETTI I can appreciate that. \nMCCLUSKY So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane. \nSCAGNETTI Lobotomy Bay? \nMCCLUSKY You've heard of it? \nSCAGNETTI So, how do I fit into this scheme? \nMCCLUSKY The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you? \nSCAGNETTI By all means. \nWe move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures toward the cell. \nMCCLUSKY Here she is...you know her, you love her, you can't live without her...Mallory Knox. \nWe PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing. \nINT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY \nCU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'. \nMALLORY (singing) 99 years is a long, long time. Look at me, I will never be free, I'm a long time woman... \nMCCLUSKY (O.S.) Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to meet you. \nMallory just keeps on truckin'. \nMALLORY (singing) Been workin' on the road now. Been workin' by the sea. Been workin' in the cane fields. and I wanna be free... \nMALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second. Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward. \nMEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold. \nCU on Scagnetti through the cell bars. \nSCAGNETTI Jesus Christ! \nCAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky. \nMCCLUSKY Don't worry about it. She does that all the time. \nBACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood trickling down her scalp. \nMCCLUSKY (O.S.) Follow me. \nINT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY \nCAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files. \nPHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men. \nWURLITZER You duckin' me Dewight? \nMCCLUSKY Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya? \nWURLITZER (to Scagnetti) This son of a bitch is chairman of the prison board, but it's like pullin' teeth to get him down to a prison. \nMCCLUSKY The only reason I'm here now is to set him straight, and I'm on the next flight out. (to Scagnetti) Jack, this is the superintendent of the jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man who's got the power of the pen here. \nWurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti. \nWURLITZER Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox. \nSCAGNETTI Thanks. \nMCCLUSKY From now on, you'll be dealin' with Phil. He can answer all the questions you got about the arrangements. I'm gonna be bidding you good luck and adieu in about twenty minutes. My flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in a hour. \nWURLITZER And I want you to know, we'll all cry a river when you're gone. \nThey all laugh. \nSCAGNETTI What's the travelling arrangements? \nWURLITZER Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey. \nSCAGNETTI And where do you keep Mickey? \nWURLITZER We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor. \nSCAGNETTI Who? \nWURLITZER Wayne Gayle. \nSCAGNETTI (surprised) Wayne Gayle! \nINT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY \nWAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty. Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it. \nWAYNE (into recorder) Testing one...two...three... testing...one...three...over, over, over, Mickey Knox meeting. \nWayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket. \nThe door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are double cuffed. \nThe Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure. \nCU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I remember every secret you ever shared. Shared or revealed? I think shared is proper. I remember every single time you laughed. \nECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo. \nMICKEY I remember every meal we ever ate. I remember your cooking. I especially remember your casseroles. I remember watching David Letterman. \nWe hear the echo of television laughter. \nMICKEY I remember driving fast...faster, man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe de Ville. \nThe sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT \nCAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory, driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around Mickey and kisses. \nMICKEY (V.O.) You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet up on the dash, singing along with the radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes', 'Groove Me'... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT \nCoupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on the hood of the car. \nMICKEY (V.O.) And your dancing, my God, your dancing. I lie on my bed and go over every day, every minute of our happiness. Every day take a day of our time and go through it hour by hour. I don't jump ahead either. I take it as it comes, and I live that day again. That way when I get to our first kiss... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear in the flame kissing passionately. \nMICKEY (V.O.) The killing of your parents, our wedding...They're not just memories. I feel that joy again... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nMEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES. \nWAYNE (reading out loud) 'After taking a few days to reflect on your offer, I've come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct. A national TV interview would be very advantageous to both Mallory and I. The only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days. However, that is your problem and not mine. I feel confident you'll manage. Here's to us making television history. Sincerely, Mickey Knox.' \nWayne drops the letter down from in front of his face. \nWAYNE Am I a God or what? \nWe now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they all pretend they are praying to him. \nThe team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE, Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's stylish yuppie demeanour. \nUnruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks straight from the bottle. \nNOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl Friday' pace. \nWAYNE Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews... \nROGER This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla. \nEverybody laughs. \nSCOTT What's the schedule, mein fuehre? \nAs Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook. She never speaks, just writes. \nWAYNE We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes. \nSCOTT Would the network really not run it without the interview? \nWAYNE Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately. \nROGER How immediate is immediately? \nWAYNE Next week's episode. \nWayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne. \nROGER We don't got enough footage for a hour follow up. \nSCOTT (pointing at Roger) What he said. \nWAYNE Rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit. Those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference. All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway. We film a new intro. Show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of Mickey and Mallory. We introduce a new angle... what the prison board is up to. We see some of that new shit, then the rest of the show is the interview. Now what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh, Julie make a note: I need Woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five' broadcast to promote next weeks show. We'll do a feed right from the jail while we're wrapping up with Mickey. \nWAYNE (V.O.) After living a very routine, drab, nothing out-of-the-ordinary-ever- happens kind of life, the sweethearts shocked the entire nation with a cross-country crime and murder spree that lasted only three weeks, but left--- \nPHOTO: BLACK & WHITE PHOTOS of bloody victims -- MEN and WOMEN. \nPHOTO: BLACK & WHITE PHOTOS of a bloodstained police chalk outline. \nWAYNE (V.O.) ---forty-eight known bodies in its wake. Including--- \nHOME MOVE FOOTAGE of Mallory and her PARENTS during happier times. All three are smiling. Mallory's in the middle with her arms around them. Mallory's father is eating a chicken drumstick. Mallory takes a bite out of it while he's holding it. \nWAYNE (V.O.) ---Mallory's very own parents. \nPHOTO: COLOR POSTCARD of Los Angeles. \nWAYNE (V.O.) They started their crime wave in Los Angeles. \nWayne Gayle stands in front of a Circle K convenience store. He speaks to us. \nWAYNE And they were finally apprehended here at this Circle K in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIRCLE K - DAY \nThis sequence is filmed in 16MM COLOR, cinema verite a'la 'COPS.' \nThe CAMERA runs behind three blue windbreaker clad COPS, as they run up to the Circle K, shouting obscenities. \nIn front of the store three windbreaker cops have Mickey on the ground, beating him with nightsticks. One COP lies on the ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming. \nTo the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP, matching each other blow for blow. \nMeanwhile, the three cops we ran with reach the action and join in. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE \nNEWSPAPER-- Newspaper or magazine COLOR AD for a 7/11 store. \nNEWSPAPER-- Newspaper or magazine COLOR AD for a gas station. \nWAYNE (V.O.) They started off robbing 7/11 type stores and gas stations and later graduated to banks and the big time. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nWayne Gayle walks down the street. The CAMERA walks with him. He speaks into the camera. \nWAYNE Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed robbery was a little different than most. It was an assault, actually. \nEXT. 7/11 STORE - DAY \nWayne interviews BISHOP, a young blonde kid with a 'Flock of Sea Gulls' haircut. Bishop's name appears on the SCREEN. \nBISHOP Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory kill everybody when they're through, except for one clerk. There were a couple of people in the store then, and I was working with Stevo. And I like Stevo, you know? But I was thinking, what could I do to make them pick me to be the clerk that gets to live? \nINT. 7/11 STORE - DAY \nThis scene is shot through the STORE'S BLACK & WHITE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The date and time of day are burned into the edges of the frame. \nMickey and Mallory charge into a 7/11 store, cocking their shotguns and shouting things. \nMickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming. \nMallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming. \nMickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams: \nMICKEY Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast! Faster! Faster! Faster than that! \nBishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun ready. \nSTEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room carrying boxes and wearing a walkman. \nMickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him. \nAs all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's narration happens over it. \nWAYNE (V.O.) They'd storm in with shotguns, and kill every customer in the place right off the bat. \nCUT TO: \nSmiling PHOTOS of other VICTIMS. We CUT from each photo to the next photo after shotgun FIRE. \nEXT. BLEACHERS - DAY \nWayne interviews three long-haired guys: CHUCK, STEVE, and JEFF. \nWAYNE What do you think of Mickey and Mallory? \nCHUCK Hot. \nJEFF Hot. \nSTEVE Totally hot. \nCHUCK Mickey and Mallory's the best thing to happen to mass murder since Manson. \nSTEVE Forty-eight people known. They're way cooler than Manson. \nCUT TO: Wayne interviewing MORGAN and PAGE, two young girls. \nWAYNE What do you think of Mickey and Mallory? \nMORGAN Well, he's just...I dunno... charismatic. \nPAGE They're so romantic. \nCUT TO: Wayne interviewing an INTENSE COP. \nINTENSE COP I'm here to watch the judge give those two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest sentence the law allows. I want to see their faces when the state says 'they are the worst scum sucking, degenerate, douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's ever shit (BLEEP) out. (referring to crowd behind him) And these assholes (BLEEP) are making heroes outta sickos. You wanna know who a hero is? You wanna know? I'll tell ya who a Goddamn hero is. Mike Griffin. Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP) should be revering. You know why Mike Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya why. Because he was killed in the line of duty. Do you want to know how he died? \nWAYNE Yes. \nINTENSE COP I'll tell you. Mike Jerome Griffin was killed in the line of duty by those two anti-heroes. \nCUT TO: Wayne interviewing RUSSELL VOSSLER, Harvard law student. \nWAYNE Tell me, Mr. Vossler, how many days of the trial have you attended? \nRUSSELL Ahhh yesss, I've been fortunate enough to attend two days. Law history in the making. I've been a participant. \nWAYNE And you being a Harvard law student, what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's performance? \nRUSSELL Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals, dare I say conquers that of master Melvin Belli. He's like a magnificent loose cannon, firing point blank in the prosecutor's face. It is my anticipation--- \nBACK TO: The long-haired guys, Chuck, Jeff & Steve as Wayne speaks. \nWAYNE You're talking about a man and a woman who killed innocent people. \nSTEVE Don't get us wrong... \nCHUCK We respect human life an' all. \nJEFF It's a tragedy. \nSTEVE But...if I was a serial killer, which I'm not, but if I was, I'd be like Mickey. \nCUT TO: Wayne talking with MARVIN, a black man. \nMARVIN They're like that crazy mother in the first Dirty Harry movie. Member that crazy ass mother? They're like him. Mickey and Mallory be doin' some cold-blooded shit. When I hear about some of the shit they be doin' on TV, I say 'Damn, that's fucked (BLEEP) up.' \nBACK TO: The two young girls, Morgan & Page as Wayne speaks. \nPAGE (laughing and blushing) We sit in the courtroom all day and try to catch Mickey's eye. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY \nWayne's sitting in the gym. Behind him MUSCLE MEN are working out. Their GRUNTING sounds fill the background. Wayne looks up and just OFF CAMERA to the people he's interviewing. \nWAYNE What do you think of Mickey and Mallory? \nECU on SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a head SHOT. \nSIMON I admire them. \nNORMAN I do, too. \nWAYNE (confused) But how can you say that? \nSIMON They're mesmerising. \nNORMAN Hypnotizing. \nSIMON Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?' \nWAYNE Yes. \nNORMAN Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno. \nWAYNE The couple proved so popular that a motion picture glamorizing their exploits was made... \nCUT TO: A POSTER for the Mickey and Mallory movie called 'Thrill Killers' is shown. It has a drawing of the Movie Mickey and Movie Mallory in a romantic pose a'la 'Gone With The Wind,' both with guns in their hands. Around them are smaller drawings of cars, people shooting, people fighting, explosions, etc. \nThe adlines are: 'RIPPED FROM TODAY'S HEADLINES --THE TRUE STORY OF MICKEY AND MALLORY.' 'THE COUPLE THAT LIVED FOR LOVE AND LOVED TO KILL.' \nThe poster lists the credits: 'Starring Jessie Alexander Warwick and Buffy St.McQueen.' 'Written and Directed by Neil Pope.' \nWAYNE (V.O.) The Movie 'Thrill Killers' proved to be a tremendous box office success, making stars out of the before then unknown--- \nCUT TO: STILLS of Movie Mickey and Movie Mallory holding weapons, posing together, creating mayhem. \nWAYNE (V.O.) ---actors Jessie Alexander Warwick and Buffy St.McQueen. \nCUT TO: \nMOVIE TRAILER FOR 'THRILL KILLERS': \nSHOT Movie Mickey dressed in a fastfood uniform. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.)

I wanna wail, baby, wail! \nSHOT of Movie Mallory on her hands and knees crawling toward CAMERA. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) And his lovely wife Mallory. \nMOVIE MALLORY I need ya, Mickey. I gotta have ya. I'm no good for no one else. when I'm with you, I burn, baby. Burn like blue flame. \nSHOT of Movie Mickey and Movie Mallory driving fast and laughing their heads off. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.)

It uses those boots for steppin' on people like me and her! \nCUT TO: \nINT. EDITING ROOM - DAY \nWayne enters an editing room where filmmaker NEIL POPE is working at a movieola. \nWAYNE (V.O.) We talked with Neil Pope, writer and director of 'Thrill Killers' for his take on the Mickey and Mallory phenomena. \nPope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets Wayne M.O.S. \nCUT INTO INTERVIEW: \nNEIL POPE It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory Knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually repressed society. A flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture. A what I tried to do with 'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed. Yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage, you've got the structure of a Wagnerian love story. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nIn a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out. The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey, shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster, where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990). \nMOVIE MALLORY Mickey, honey, listen to me. \nMovie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does. \nMOVIE MALLORY I can't go. I'm too fucked up. \nMOVIE MICKEY I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but-- \nMOVIE MALLORY I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here. \nMOVIE MICKEY No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way! \nMOVIE MALLORY If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you--- \nMOVIE MICKEY No fuckin' way! \nDR. REINGHOLD Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nSHOTS of the crowd. \nWAYNE (V.O.) This attitude from the young towards their ultimate anti-heroes is nation wide. And spreading. \nTWO LONDON TEENS \nBOY and GIRL, dressed like the Knox's. \nTITLE CARD: 'LONDON' \nLONDON BOY You take all the great figures from the States...Elvis, Jack Keroac, Bukowski, James Dean, Jim Morrison, Angela Davis, Jack Nicholson, Jim Thompson, Martin Scorcese...add a bloody pale of nitro and you got Mickey and Mallory. They're like rebels without a cause, except they have a cause. Only nobody knows what it is. \nLONDON GIRL (screaming) Their cause is each utter! \nTWO JAPANESE TEENS a BOY and GIRL, dressed like the Knox's. They speak in Japanese, which is translated in English. \nTITLE CARD: 'JAPAN' \nAs Japanese boy and girl speak, we hear: \nTRANSLATOR (V.O.) Keep the faith, Mickey and Mallory, keep the faith. \nTWO FRENCH TEENS a BOY and GIRL, dressed like the Knox's. They speak in French, and we hear the translation in English. \nTITLE CARD: 'FRANCE' \nTRANSLATOR (V.O.) Mickey and Mallory have a love that's L.A.M.F. \nFRENCH BOY (in English) They are super cool! \nINT. WAYNE'S STUDIO - DAY \nWAYNE And as to almost give this whole misplaced admiration scenario a cherry on the top, the rock band Redd Kross entered the charts last week at number 13 with their song 'Natural Born Killers, The Saga of Mickey and Mallory.' \nCUT TO: A CLIP from the Redd Kross video of 'Natural Born Killers.' \nBACK TO: WAYNE'S STUDIO \nWAYNE The third wicked twist to this story is Grace Mulberry. \nCUT TO: \nFRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER - Headline reads: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY KILL SIX TEENS DURING SLUMBER PARTY!' In smaller bold face under it: 'One Teen Escapes Killer's Clutches.' On the front page is a PHOTO of the teen who escaped. It's seventeen year old GRACE MULBERRY. CAMERA moves in CU of the photo. \nWAYNE (V.O.) Of the six teens murdered that night, seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was the lucky one left to tell the tale. And this haunted young lady summoned up the courage to take the stand, tell what she saw that horrible night, and then allow herself to be cross-examined by the man who killed her brother and girlfriends. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nAll kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media event. \nGrace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators and reporters surround the car. \nGrace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start walking up the courthouse steps. \nMicrophones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask questions. \nGrace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the direction of each question, but she doesn't answer. \nShe remains silent and scared. \nFEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER Miss Mulberry! How does it feel to be the only survivor of Mickey and Mallory's reign of terror? \nFAT MALE REPORTER Miss Mulberry! Has the experience marked you? \nSome scruffy TRANSIENT sticks his head in Grace's face. \nTRANSIENT Did ya watch your brother get stabbed up? \nWAYNE How do you feel about Mickey cross- examining you? \nGrace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we hear the cry of: \nVOICE (O.S.) Mickey and Mallory! \nCAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit. \nMickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their faces. \nWAYNE Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry? \nMICKEY I'm keen with anticipation. \nECU of Grace's finger rolling a large, male-style, High School class ring around her palm. \nCU of Mickey glancing to the ring. Mickey smiles. \nMickey's POV of Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength. Clenching the ring tight in her fist, her eyes come up and lock hatefully on Mickey. \nCU Mickey as he walks forward towards Grace. \nMICKEY That's one helluva story, Miss Mulberry. \nCU of Grace. \nGRACE Yes it is. \nAt this point Mickey begins to pace from right to left, but always remaining in CU. \nMICKEY Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... \nBACK TO: Grace as we DOLLY from a MED CU into a ECU. \nMICKEY Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your late brother Tim, if you feel up to it. \nCONTINUE DOLLY: Once locked onto her eyes, her head drops forward and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT \nECU of Grace's eyes as her head is pulled back into frame. Her eyes are wide with fear. The CAMERA pulls back to reveal a gag in her mouth and a knife pressed against her throat. \nShe's back at the night of the murder. \nMickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t-shirt, which is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with blood. But he's walking and talking with the same manner and poise as in the courtroom. \nMICKEY Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace... \nTWO SHOT revealing that Grace is bound and gagged with Mallory right behind her, holding the knife and cracking gum. \nMALLORY Naw, she don't mind. \nMICKEY Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nCU of Grace in a daze. \nMICKEY (O.S.) Did you get along? \nMickey waits for an answer that doesn't come. \nMICKEY Miss Mulberry? \nBack to Grace. \nGRACE More or less. \nMICKEY More or less... \nBACK TO: Mickey. \nMICKEY What do you mean by that? \nBACK TO: Grace. \nGRACE Well, he's my older brother. When we were growing up, there were times we could of very well done without each other. But when it counted, we were close. \nCU of Bisbing listening. Grace is doing better than she thought. \nCAMERA PANS from shadows to find Mickey, the pan continues through his line. \nMICKEY I'd like to talk about Tim's martial arts abilities. How long had he been studying? \nPAN CONTINUES back into the shadows, then 180 degrees to find Grace. \nGRACE He started when he was in the seventh grade, so that would make it nine years. \nPAN CONTINUES back into shadows, then... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL - DAY \nCAMERA PANS from darkness into a well lit martial arts class room in full session. TIM MULBERRY and expert martial artist is competing against a lesser opponent while their master looks on. \nINT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT as Tim flies into FRAME, CRASHING into the living room wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nWe quickly PAN down a number of items with white evidence tags on them. We stop at Mickey's Buck Knife. Mickey's hand comes into FRAME and picks up the knife. \nMICKEY Then I took... \nCU of Mickey as he brings the knife into FRAME. \nMICKEY ...this knife and proceeded to tear him limb from limb. And this man, whose hands are lethal weapons--- \nCU of Bisbing as she stands. \nBISBING Objection, defence is intimidating the witness with the murder weapon. \nJUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.) Sustained. Mr. Knox, put the knife down. \nMickey is locked on Grace. \nMICKEY (cont'd) --had little to no defence. \nGRACE (yelling) I don't know how you did it, but you did it! \nJUDGE STEINSMA Mr. Knox! The knife! \nMickey glances to the judge, then slowly places the knife back on the table. \nMICKEY How do you think a human being could possibly be capable of doing something like that? \nMickey locks eyes with eyes. \nGRACE (yelling) I don't know! \nMickey is on top of her. \nMICKEY Now...I don't believe that Grace. I think you have a definite opinion on how I was able to do those things you described. Now, I'm going to ask you again. And I want you to remember you are under oath. \nGrace collects herself. \nMICKEY (O.S.) In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was I able to murder you brother Tim Mulberry in the manner you described. \nThe Judge looks down at Grace. \nGrace looks back into her open palm. CU of the ring. \nBACK TO: Mickey bearing down on her, waiting for an answer. \nBACK TO: Grace as we slowly DOLLY closer she looks up at Mickey timidly. \nGRACE (softly) You're not human. \nMickey smiles. \nGRACE I thought about it a lot. And the only thing I could figure is that you're not human. \nBisbing hides her disappointment by looking down. \nMickey straightens up as Grace continues. \nGRACE You're a vampire, or the devil, or a monster, or cyborg, or something like that. But you're not human. \nGrace breaks down. Putting her hands to her head to stop the pain. \nCU of Mickey smiling down at her. \nCU Mallory smiling proudly at Mickey. \nCU Judge Steinsma betraying no emotion looks down at Grace. \nCU of Grace sobbing, she tries to collect herself by clutching the ring tighter. \nMickey rolls his pencil in his hand the CAMERA tilts up as he leans into a CU. \nMICKEY (softly) Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing... \nGRACE (softly into her lap) What... \nMickey smiles. \nMICKEY You're right. \nPHOTO: Mickey in prison uniform being led by guards. \nPHOTO: Shot though bars of Mallory in her cell. Her back is to the camera. \nWAYNE (V.O.) The sentence was never to reach that point. Because after only a year, Mickey and Mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided... \nINSERT: FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ASYLUM.' \nWAYNE (V.O.) ...that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital. \nCAMERA move into the picture of Mickey and Mallory on the front page of the newspaper. \nCUT TO: \nPHOTO: of Dewight McClusky. \nWAYNE (V.O.) We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and Mallory case. \nINT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY \nWayne's interviewing McClusky. \nWAYNE Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision? \nMCCLUSKY The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need. \nWAYNE Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed? \nMCCLUSKY Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates. \nWAYNE When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed? \nMCCLUSKY What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong. \nWAYNE Who is we? \nMCCLUSKY The prison board and the doctors who examined them. \nWAYNE Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them? \nMCCLUSKY Using the same doctors is not common practice. \nWAYNE I take it by your answer it was a whole new team? \nMCCLUSKY Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that. \nPHOTO: of DR. ALBERT RODRIGUEZ. \nWAYNE (V.O.) The two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of Albert Rodriguez... \nPHOTO: of DR. FELIX VARGUS. \nWAYNE (V.O.) ...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the good doctors, for whatever reason, refused to be interviewed. \nINT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBack with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing. \nDR. REINGHOLD It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated. \nWAYNE So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane? \nDR. REINGHOLD Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn. \nFREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold. \nINT. EDITING BAY - DAY \nWayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on Scott and Roger's shoulders. \nWAYNE Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing. \nSCOTT Okay. \nWayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie. \nWAYNE Children, we have a show. (to Scott & Roger) You two get some long well overdue sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and early, county jail and then journey's end...Mickey Knox. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: 'TOMORROW--BRIGHT AND EARLY.' \nINT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY \nMickey's pacing back and forth in his cell, trying out different jokes. \nSCAGNETTI See, I've been there twice. And I'm not lookin' forward to goin' back. But I'm in and out. You, on the other hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the rest of your life there. Now that's what I call cruel and inhuman punishment. \nMallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking. \nSCAGNETTI Course you're not gonna give a shit. 'Cause when the good doctor's get through givin' you the zap... (he puts his finger next to his temple, pantomimes being electrocuted) ...You won't know where the hell you are. They'll just put you on a window sill, and water you every other day. \nMallory lets out a big yawn. \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nWayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally bursting into laughter. \nWAYNE (to his crew) And when he gets here, its no dick'n around time. Make him up, clip a mike on him, then leave him alone. I don't want you talking to him. I don't want you getting in his face. I want you hiding behind your gear. You are invisible. \nCAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how he can still walk. \nWAYNE (to his crew) Okay, break. \nWayne's team disburses. \nWURLITZER Okay, boys, lets start undoing him. \nTwo deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne. \nWayne approaches Mickey. \nMICKEY (to Wayne) Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about. \nWAYNE All right, Mickey. \nMICKEY Let's discuss it when I'm unbound. \nCAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove the chains. \nINT. HOLDING CELL - DAY \nCAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind. \nBingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's wrists. \nMallory's silent. \nScagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette. \nBINGHAM Turn around and face the wall! \nMallory does. \nBingham and Washington move to the door. \nSCAGNETTI Wait outside for a second, fellas. \nBINGHAM We're not supposed--- \nSCAGNETTI Don't worry about it. \nBingham and Washington move outside. \nScagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door. \nMallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back to him. \nScagnetti walks up behind her. \nMallory doesn't move. \nSCAGNETTI Want a smoke? \nMallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti. \nSCAGNETTI C'mon, I already lit one for you. I know you smoke. \nMallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of Mallory. \nSCAGNETTI I was reading the file on you. You know what it said during your trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, your answer was always the same...'I love Mickey.' It also says that when they gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey' was the only thing you said that registered as the truth. \nScagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory. \nSCAGNETTI Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is that the attraction? Or does he just got a big dick? \nScagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear. \nSCAGNETTI That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a big donkey dick. \nScagnetti presses closer. \nWAYNE Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes. \nWURLITZER Don't call my men assholes. \nWAYNE I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here. \nWayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up a light stand. \nWAYNE Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of these assholes. Now I want to create the illusion that this is just Mickey and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves. So make sure you don't film these assholes. I don't want to see 'em on film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five' slated our spot as human interest which means we'll go live at just after five-thirty. \nWayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G. \nWurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies. \nWURLITZER This asshole's tryin' to tell me what I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him! This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's dealin' with here, but we do. And if shit happens, he ain't gonna be responsible, we are. So keep your shotguns out, your fingers on the triggers, and be ready to fire at a moment's notice. \nBACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a donut. He takes a big bite. \nROGER Say something. \nMICKEY (mouthful of donut) What? \nROGER Anything. \nMickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem. \nMICKEY (talking in rhyme) I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore, As I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep! O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? \nMickey bites into the donut. \nMICKEY (mouthful of donut) How was that? \nRoger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike. \nROGER Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box. \nMICKEY There's a chocolate cream filled in there? \nROGER Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special. \nMICKEY Tough titty, it's mine now. \nROGER Look, I'll trade you. \nWayne enters frame. \nWAYNE Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra. \nROGER (to himself) Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer. \nRoger exits FRAME. \nWayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey. \nWAYNE Sorry about that. \nMICKEY Don't worry about it. \nWAYNE We're about ready to go here. Are you ready? \nMICKEY Let's do it. \nWayne smiles and exits FRAME. \nWAYNE (O.S.) Okay people! Let's start to settle down here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \n16mm - BLACK & WHITE \nSCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of Mickey's eye. \nCAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face. \nWAYNE (O.S.) Are you comfortable? \nMickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods. \nWAYNE (O.S.) Roger? \nROGER (O.S.) Rockin'! \nWAYNE (O.S.) Scotty? \nWAYNE Tell me about the purity. \nMICKEY (laughing) It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job. \nWAYNE (laughs) Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later. \nMICKEY I'm sure we will. \nWAYNE Describe Mallory. \nMICKEY Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers... \nWAYNE Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. (points at his head) What's up here? (points at his heart) What's in here? \nMICKEY That's indescribable. \nWAYNE Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again? \nMICKEY (smiles) Says who? \nWAYNE Says the United States of America. \nMICKEY (laughs) When have they ever been right? \nThe crew laughs (O.S.) \nMICKEY Hey, just like Soupy Sales. \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY \nScagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room. His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose. Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril. \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nScagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture. \nMICKEY ...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows? \nSCAGNETTI (whispers) How's it goin'? \nWURLITZER (whispers) Shhhh! I wanna hear this. \nWurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face. \nWURLITZER What the hell happened to you? \nSCAGNETTI You should see the other bitch. What time you got? \nWURLITZER Two-thirty. Shhh... \nCAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to Mickey's story. \nMICKEY But I came to the direction I need a gun. Do, the next day I started off early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a gun shop and pick up a little home protection. I walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the this really nice sales guy comes up to me. His name was Warren. I'll never forget his name. He was really nice. Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo. Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and we were off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA: \nMEDIUM CU on Mickey. \nMICKEY Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer. \nWAYNE Okay, let's cut it. \nBACK TO: COLOR 35mm \nWAYNE (to Scott) Did ya get that? \nUnruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages. \nSCOTT It's gonna be beautiful. \nWAYNE Super cool. (to Mickey) This is great stuff. How ya doin'? \nMICKEY I could go for a Coke. \nWAYNE (yelling) Could I get a Coke for Mickey? \nWURLITZER I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke. \nWAYNE Fine. (to Unruly Julie) Julie, why don't you make a food run? (to the room) What's around here? \nDEPUTY SHERIFF There's an In and Out Burgers about a block away on Olive. It's walking distance. \nWAYNE Okay, Julie, take everybody's order. I'll have a double double with cheese, french fries, and a large Coke. \nA SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS. \nThe Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before moving on. \nCAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling across the floor. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nSHOT through Scott's CAMERA: \nFOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT. \nMICKEY You guys wanna hear a joke I heard? \nWAYNE (O.S.) Sure. \nMICKEY Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date. \nAs Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's CAMERA follows. \nMICKEY The mother asks, 'Where's he taking you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in movie.' The mother tells her she can only go if she takes Little Johnny with her. She says okay. They go to the drive-in, they come back. The mother gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay, what happened? Where did ya go?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts like he's driving. \nMICKEY Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What did they do?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing. \nMICKEY 'They kissed. What else?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts. \nMICKEY 'He felt her up? What else?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing. \nMICKEY (dumbfounded) 'They took off their clothes? What else?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex. \nMICKEY 'They did it? What were you doing?' \nMickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking off. \nEveryone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies, even Scagnetti cracks a smile. \nAs Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4 during the punchline. \nWhile everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with the butt. \nDeputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious. \nScott's CAMERA goes wild. \nBACK TO: COLOR 35mm. \nThe other deputies react. \nMickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with a THUD. \nDeputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin. \nDeputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION. \nThe stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him out of FRAME. \nDeputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up -- SLOW MOTION. \nCU of ceiling being BLASTED. \nChunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3. \nScagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to fire -- SLOW MOTION. \nMickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti -- SLOW MOTION. \nScagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey. \nSquatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti. \nThey're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the room. \nNobody fires. \nCAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls into FRAME screaming. \nMICKEY (O.S.) Get the camera! Get the fucking camera! \nBACK TO: COLOR 35mm. \nAs Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from Roger's side. \nThe Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last hostage. \nDeputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead and silent. \nMICKEY (to Mallory) This way. \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nThe caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan the remaining hostage deputy. \nMICKEY (to Duncan) Where does this lead? \nDuncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to wall. \nMICKEY Where!?! \nDUNCAN Th-- the ground floor. \nMALLORY Is that the front door? \nDuncan nods frantically. \nMICKEY Let's go. \nMickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the stairs. They go down a few flights. \nAs they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies raise their guns. \nMallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her. \nMALLORY Back off or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll blast him! \nNone of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less likely to start shooting. \nWayne screams. \nWAYNE Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot! Please, please, please... \nWayne continues begging. \nWurlitzer steps forward. \nWURLITZER Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say--- \nMALLORY Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna hear it! \nWURLITZER You have to know--- \nMALLORY I said shut up... \nMallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head. \nWayne's screaming in pain. \nThe deputies jump back. \nMALLORY ...and I mean shut up! \nThere's a bit of a silent standoff. \nTears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly retreats back up the stairs to the next flight. \nThe deputies hold their present position. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY \nThe caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory let their two hostages sit down. \nDuncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his uniform. \nMickey's pacing. \nMICKEY Think...think...think... \nMallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's been shot. \nThe deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would die. \nMallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer. \nMickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder. \nNOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE and COLOR 35mm. \nWayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared. \nWAYNE (yelling) My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty million people every week! I am a respected journalist, winners of the Golden Globe, the Edward R. Murrows Award among others! If anybody puts me in danger, my network will sue The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. My estate will sue every officer personally who fires. The network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis and Sinclair... \nMickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the deputies. \nMALLORY (yelling) Make a path! \nThe wall of deputies starts moving backward. \nThe Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne yelling all the way. \nThe deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea. \nWurlitzer stands his ground. \nWURLITZER How far do you think your gonna get? \nMICKEY Right out the front door. \nWURLITZER That'll never happen. \nMICKEY It is happening. \nThe caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready. \nWayne stops his speech to take a breath. \nMALLORY Don't stop! \nWayne starts up again. \nThe deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer are nose to nose. \nWURLITZER (to Mickey) I will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife, and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself. \nMICKEY (calmly) Another day perhaps, but not today. \nMickey leaves FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY \nThe doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey, Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open air. \nA crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey. \nFREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE. \nImage DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE LEADER. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nThe WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK & WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a fence post. \nThis entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly into the CAMERA. \nWAYNE This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead. This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway. When we were followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tossed his body out of the back. Mickey told authorities over my police band that I would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. They took Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't employed, I don't know. My only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made. We've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview. Tensions run high-- \nMickey screams O.S. \nMICKEY (O.S.) We ain't got all fuckin' day! \nWAYNE Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory... \nWayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held. \nCAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces in and out of FRAME in the B.G. \nWAYNE Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work? \nMALLORY It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work. \nWAYNE (O.S.) What did you think then? \nMALLORY I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long. \n", "test1_input": "Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS. \nWAYNE (aside to Scott) Here's the welcome wagon. \nWurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand. \nWURLITZER Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you. \nWAYNE Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again? \nWURLITZER I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here. \nWAYNE That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy. (to his crew) I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me. \nJulie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks confidentially to Wurlitzer. \nWAYNE The main thing I need is a big room, shut off from the population, so we can get some privacy...with a few electrical outlets. \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nWayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook. \nWurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA moves from person to person without cutting. \nWURLITZER (to two Deputies) This is just for an interview, I was on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once. It was a much bigger deal than this. They had a crew of maybe seventy-five people. \nCAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott. \nWAYNE We're gonna be talking over here. But I want enough freedom so if I wanna get up and move around, we can. \nWayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left. \nWAYNE Take him and walk him over this way. (pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents, what the hell was that all about? (pauses--to Scott) Then maybe take him to the window. \nHe walks Scott to the window. \nWAYNE (pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail today, what's the first thing you'd do? (pause--to Scott) Little shit like that. I don't wanna have to feel I gotta stay in the chairs. We're after a cinema verite, anything can happen, truth twenty-four times a second kindda feel. \nEnd of single SHOT. \nWurlitzer's talking with Deputies. \nWURLITZER And when it's lunch time, they don't just go to McDonalds. They got cooks there servin' great food. Swedish meatballs... \nWayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies. \nWURLITZER How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle? \nWAYNE Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you. \nWURLITZER By all means. \nWayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around the room. \nWAYNE You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they? \nWURLITZER Oh yes, indeed. Top flight. \nWAYNE Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie. \nWURLITZER Is that her real name? \nWAYNE Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand. \nWayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this. \nWURLITZER I see. \nWAYNE Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before--- \nWURLITZER (proudly) Ya know, I was. \nWAYNE (acting surprised) Really? \nWURLITZER I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago. \nWAYNE (still acting surprised) Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members--- \nWURLITZER Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more. \nWAYNE See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it? \nWURLITZER It sure is. \nWAYNE They got a asshole over here. (pointing to his left) A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there. (points to his right) A asshole perched up there. (points straight up) Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this... (indicates the hustle and bustle of a set) ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy. \n", "test1_true": "WAYNE That's why my crew is only three...an invisible three. (switching gears) Which brings me to what I wanted to talk to you about. I have to get Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to share what he's never shared before... Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till today have been closed. Well, how can we expect him to do that when we got Los Angeles County Sheriffs up the walls. \nSuddenly, things get short between the two men. \nWURLITZER (snorts) Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do? \nWAYNE Lose 'em. \nWURLITZER Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is? \nWAYNE Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career. \nThey're out and out angry. \nWURLITZER Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed--- \nWAYNE Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do. \nWURLITZER Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig. \nWAYNE One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle. (pause) Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want. (pause) But seriously, Phil, look at this. \nWayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs. \nWAYNE (counting) We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys. \nWURLITZER Wayne, if it was anybody else--- \nWAYNE Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it. \nWURLITZER What are we talking about? \nWAYNE Two guys? \nWURLITZER Okay. I'll take two guys off. \nWAYNE No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys. \nWURLITZER I can't do that. Five guys. \nWAYNE Three. \nWURLITZER I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it. \nINT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY \nMickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head. \nCAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open. The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and shackles. \nDEPUTY #1 On your feet! Turn your face to the wall. \nMickey gets up. \nMICKEY Now what you're supposed to say is: 'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.' \nOFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY \nCU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell door makes her up with a jolt. \nSCAGNETTI (O.S.) Rise and shine, Mallory! \nMallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance. \nCAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and WASHINGTON. \nSCAGNETTI Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it? \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY \nCU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and Washington's shiny black shoes. \nThe SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor, along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes, reverberates throughout the scene. \nMallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag. \nSCAGNETTI It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield? \nMallory looks straight ahead. \n", "test2_input": "WAYNE Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad. \nMICKEY Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told. \nRoger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds like a lawn mower. \nMICKEY How is it? \nROGER Not good. \nMICKEY Do you have a back up. \nROGER It's video. \nMICKEY Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen! \nCUT TO BLACK: \nINT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY \nWurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us. \nWURLITZER I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway. \nPITNEY (O.S.) Capt'n! \nWurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down. \nPITNEY (O.S.) Here's the layout of the laundry room. \nWURLITZER Where do the air ducts lead? \nPITNEY (O.S.) Here. \nSMITHY (O.S.) Problem is they'll hear somebody approaching that way. \nPITNEY (O.S.) We turned off the power when they took over the room. \nWURLITZER We turn it back on. The machines go back on supplying us with the cover noise we need. Smithy, do it. \nSMITHY (O.S.) Right away, Capt'n. \nCAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction. \nWURLITZER Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place? \nJONESY (O.S.) Yes. \nWURLITZER You sure? \nJONESY (O.S.) I think-- \nWURLITZER Never say you think when you know, or you know when you think. \nWurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie. \nWURLITZER (into walkie talkie) Bergman, you in place? \nBERGMAN (O.S.) (from walkie talkie) Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet. \nWURLITZER (into walkie talkie) Pass this to your team...the second they get a lock on a blue, they're to take the shot. Do you understand? \nBERGMAN (O.S.) (from walkie talkie) That's a big ten-four, Capt'n. \nWurlitzer looks to his right. \nWURLITZER What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there? \nPITNEY (O.S.) It's hard to say Capt'n. \nWURLITZER Take a wild stab! \nPITNEY (O.S.) I'll say enough to destroy this wing. \nWURLITZER The entire wing? \nPITNEY (O.S.) That's my opinion. \nWURLITZER Jesus... \nCUT TO: \nSCREEN FILLS WITH STATIC. \nINSERT TITLE CARD: 'SPECIAL REPORT' \n", "test2_true": "INT. NEWS ROOM - DAY \nTitle Card recedes in FRAME to expose an active news room in the B.G. News Anchor TONY CHAVEZ is lowering himself behind a desk while adjusting his earphone. \nCHAVEZ Good afternoon, I'm Tony Chavez and this is a KKTV Special Report. At this moment we are receiving preliminary reports of a hostage-- (fingering earphone) I...I'm sorry. I'm being told that we're now taking you live to L.A. County Jail where Wayne Gayle is standing by. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nVIDEO FOOTAGE: \nNOTE: The video footage is all handheld and harshly lit, until otherwise specified. \nWayne, stands alone in FRAME, moments from when we last saw him. \nWAYNE This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from the Los Angeles County Jail, where you can tell from the bloody carnage behind me that the final chapter in the book called Mickey and Mallory has not yet been written. \nMickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out. \nMICKEY Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie just underwent a title change. It's now called 'The Escape of Mickey and Mallory.' Starring me, you, Mallory, and special guest accomplice, Jack- fucked-up-fingers-Scagnetti. (into CAMERA) Okay, Donut, move in for a close up. I want this for prosperity. \nCAMERA ZOOMS into a CU of Scagnetti. \nMICKEY (O.S.) Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene. \nSCAGNETTI (slightly out of it) She's in the holding cell, on this floor. \nMICKEY (O.S.) You're taking us to that holding cell now. (into CAMERA) All right, Cut! \nThe CAMERA shuts off. SCREEN fills with STATIC. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEWS ROOM - DAY \nTony Chavez speaks into CAMERA. \nCHAVEZ Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have just tuned in, it appears that a hostage situation involving Mickey Knox is developing presently at the Los Angeles County Jail. We have seen that he is armed and apparently there has been some loss of life. We will try to re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle and bring you more on this late breaking story. Please stay tuned. \nINSERT TITLE CARD: 'SPECIAL REPORT' \nTV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) This has been a KKTV Special Report. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nBACK TO: COLOR 35mm \nWIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off the floor, and puts them in his pocket. \nMickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and slips it into his pants. \nMICKEY Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing. Stand behind me, put your back against mine and extend your arms behind you. \nScagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against Mickey's. \nMICKEY Now if I feel your back move away from mine, you're gonna be ripped apart. Got it? \nScagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey. \nSCAGNETTI Yeah. \nMICKEY Okay, Wayne, step forward. \nWayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun. \nMICKEY Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus against the barrel. \nWayne does. \nMICKEY Grab his arms. \nWayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him. \nMICKEY Either one of you two move, it's gonna be shotgun city. You understand? \nWAYNE & SCAGNETTI Yes. \nMickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt. \nMICKEY You ready, Donut? \nROGER Ready. \n", "test3_input": "MICKEY Wagons, hooaaa! \nThe hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to his neck. \nRoger follows with the camera. \nINT. HOLDING CELL - DAY \nMallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to herself, and doing the hand motions. \nMALLORY (singing) Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing there isn't much to it. All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I like the rest, but the best part I like is Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo, do quack, quack. \nThe cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey, Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped with tape. \nCU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes. \nMICKEY (to Mallory) Honey, I'm home. \nMallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something everybody told them they would never do again. \nFor this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple. \nMALLORY (in between kisses) It's taken you so long to come to me. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY \nA sheet of paper flashes through FRAME. \nBAILEY (O.S.) Here's the list of the rioters. \nCAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up. \nWURLITZER Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the list of the hostages? \nBAILEY (O.S.) I'm working on it Capt'n. \nWURLITZER Keep on it, son. \nWurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces. \nWURLITZER (reading the names) Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez, Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos, Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard... \nWurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with his hands. \nNAPALATONI (O.S.) Capt'n. \nWurlitzer looks up, then looks back down. \nWURLITZER What is it Napalatoni? \nNAPALATONI (O.S.) Mickey Knox is loose. \nWurlitzer looks up. \nWURLITZER What do you mean he's loose? \nNAPALATONI (O.S.) He's armed, he's killed three deputies and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle, another TV guy, that cop fella, and two other deputies as hostages. And Capt'n, they have one of them news cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't stop playin' it. What do you want us to do? \nWurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing would come out. He just sits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOLDING CELL - DAY \nThe hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is standing, alert and ready for action. \nAs for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger, tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man. \nMickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn. \nMICKEY Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building. (to Wayne) Donut said something about a news van. \nWAYNE Yeah, we have a van. \nMICKEY Where's it parked? \nWAYNE Out front. \nMICKEY Let me have the keys. \nWayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses the keys to Mickey. \nWAYNE Mickey, can I talk to you alone? \n", "test3_true": "WAYNE This is crazy. You can't escape like this. \nMICKEY Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try. \nWAYNE We'll all be killed. \nMALLORY Exciting, isn't it? \nDuncan begins to cry. \nMICKEY Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it? \nMALLORY Are we in a big hurry? \nMICKEY You got something you want to do? \nMALLORY Yeah. \nMICKEY By all means, knock yourself out. \nMALLORY Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut. \nRoger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder. \nVIDEO FOOTAGE: \nShot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor. \nMALLORY You! Stand up! \nScagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the wrong woman. \nMallory walks up to him with pistol in hand. \nMALLORY You probably thought it was pretty funny, didn't ya? \nShe raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner. Scagnetti flinches and squirms. \nMALLORY Can you remember the last time you fucked with me? Close your eyes and remember...Are ya thinking about it? Good. \nMallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest. \nRoger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh... \nMICKEY We're sending out a hostage. Don't touch him! \nOFF SCREEN the door is kicked open. \nRoger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell and... \nINT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY \nThere are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor. \nCROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the caravan. \nThe footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky, real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle. \nThe soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing, and gunfire. \nHOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey. \nThe wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them. \nMickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees this and screams. \nMALLORY Mickey! \nMICKEY Don't stop! \nRoger's CAMERA runs along with them. \nROGER (O.S.) Man, oh, man...this is better than Vietnam! \nMore DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway. \nMickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them. Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear. \nDUNCAN Please don't kill me! Don't kill me... \nCAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner. The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST. \nRoger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S. \n"}

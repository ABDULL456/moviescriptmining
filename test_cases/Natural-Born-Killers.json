{"test1_input": "CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I remember every secret you ever shared. Shared or revealed? I think shared is proper. I remember every single time you laughed. \nECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo. \nMICKEY I remember every meal we ever ate. I remember your cooking. I especially remember your casseroles. I remember watching David Letterman. \nWe hear the echo of television laughter. \nMICKEY I remember driving fast...faster, man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe de Ville. \nThe sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT \nCAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory, driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around Mickey and kisses. \nMICKEY (V.O.) You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet up on the dash, singing along with the radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes', 'Groove Me'... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT \nCoupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on the hood of the car. \nMICKEY (V.O.) And your dancing, my God, your dancing. I lie on my bed and go over every day, every minute of our happiness. Every day take a day of our time and go through it hour by hour. I don't jump ahead either. I take it as it comes, and I live that day again. That way when I get to our first kiss... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear in the flame kissing passionately. \nMICKEY (V.O.) The killing of your parents, our wedding...They're not just memories. I feel that joy again... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nMEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES. \nWAYNE (reading out loud) 'After taking a few days to reflect on your offer, I've come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct. A national TV interview would be very advantageous to both Mallory and I. The only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days. However, that is your problem and not mine. I feel confident you'll manage. Here's to us making television history. Sincerely, Mickey Knox.' \nWayne drops the letter down from in front of his face. \nWAYNE Am I a God or what? \nWe now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they all pretend they are praying to him. \nThe team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE, Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's stylish yuppie demeanour. \nUnruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks straight from the bottle. \nNOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl Friday' pace. \nWAYNE Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews... \nROGER This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla. \nEverybody laughs. \nSCOTT What's the schedule, mein fuehre? \nAs Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook. She never speaks, just writes. \nWAYNE We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes. \nSCOTT Would the network really not run it without the interview? \nWAYNE Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately. \nROGER How immediate is immediately? \nWAYNE Next week's episode. \nWayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne. \nROGER We don't got enough footage for a hour follow up. \nSCOTT (pointing at Roger) What he said. \nWAYNE Rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit. Those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference. All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway. We film a new intro. Show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of Mickey and Mallory. We introduce a new angle... what the prison board is up to. We see some of that new shit, then the rest of the show is the interview. Now what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh, Julie make a note: I need Woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five' broadcast to promote next weeks show. We'll do a feed right from the jail while we're wrapping up with Mickey. \n", "test1_true": "WAYNE You too Scott, Betacam and a remote, keep it simple. \nScott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne. \nSCOTT Betacam with remote and two-way comm link. Got it. (opens eyes) How about the interview...What camera do you want to use? \nWayne closes his eyes. \nWAYNE I see...high contrast sixteen millimetre black and white, and I mean black and white, where the black's black and the white's white. This is for posterity, so fuck video. Film! Film! Film! \nWayne pounds on the table. CU of Unruly Julie writing in her notebook: 'Film...film...film!' \nWAYNE So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview. (points at Roger & Scott) You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in. \nSCOTT When do you want the assembly? \nWAYNE Tomorrow. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: 'TOMORROW' \nCUT TO: \nINT. TV STATION CORRIDOR - DAY \nCAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they march quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her notebook. \nWAYNE At that point I'll ask him if he believes in God. If he says yes, I'll ask him what he thinks God would make of his actions. And is he worried about burning in hell? If he says no, I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you believe in?' And hopefully he'll say something like a live round of ammo, the expression on the face of a man he just split up the middle, Mallory's eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. He's bound to say something provocative. \nWayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before, except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy. \nWAYNE Okay, boys, let's have it. \nSCOTT Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first... \nROGER But we changed the order around so it wasn't super obvious... \nSCOTT Then we added the new shit to the tail... \nROGER So we film the interview, and we can just slap it on at the end. \nWayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit. \nWAYNE Okay, let's see it. \nCU of video monitor screen. We see a show rewinding. \nROGER (O.S.) Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope. \nWAYNE (V.O.) I hear ya. Play. \nCU of Roger's hand pressing a play button. \nCUT TO: \nStatic. Then the opening slate for 'AMERICAN MANIACS' fills the SCREEN. \nBEGIN: HIGHWAY - DAY \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nWAYNE GAYLE is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The CAMERA looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he looks practically mythic. \nWayne speaks into the camera. \nWAYNE Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'. I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is Highway 58. \nWayne walks toward the CAMERA. We DOLLY back. \nWAYNE To some the fastest distance between point A and point B. To others a beautiful stretch to the American landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory Knox, it was a candy land of murder and mayhem. \nWhile we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm movie footage. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a normal life. \nHOME MOVIE - Mickey shaking hands with the JUDGE who married them. Mallory stands happily by Mickey's side. \nHOME MOVIE - Mallory hamming up the sex angle, as she poses by Bob's Big Boy. \nHOME MOVIE - Mallory sitting on Mickey's lap at home. \nHOME MOVIE - CU of Mallory asleep in bed.

He's hurt bad. \nMICKEY Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told. \nRoger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds like a lawn mower. \nMICKEY How is it? \nROGER Not good. \nMICKEY Do you have a back up. \nROGER It's video. \nMICKEY Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen! \nCUT TO BLACK: \nINT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY \nWurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us. \nWURLITZER I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway. \nPITNEY (O.S.) Capt'n! \nWurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down. \nPITNEY (O.S.) Here's the layout of the laundry room. \nWURLITZER Where do the air ducts lead? \nPITNEY (O.S.) Here. \nSMITHY (O.S.) Problem is they'll hear somebody approaching that way. \nPITNEY (O.S.) We turned off the power when they took over the room. \nWURLITZER We turn it back on. The machines go back on supplying us with the cover noise we need. Smithy, do it. \nSMITHY (O.S.) Right away, Capt'n. \nCAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction. \nWURLITZER Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place? \nJONESY (O.S.) Yes. \nWURLITZER You sure? \nJONESY (O.S.) I think-- \nWURLITZER Never say you think when you know, or you know when you think. \nWurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie. \nWURLITZER (into walkie talkie) Bergman, you in place? \nBERGMAN (O.S.) (from walkie talkie) Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet. \nWURLITZER (into walkie talkie) Pass this to your team...the second they get a lock on a blue, they're to take the shot. Do you understand? \nBERGMAN (O.S.) (from walkie talkie) That's a big ten-four, Capt'n. \nWurlitzer looks to his right. \nWURLITZER What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there? \nPITNEY (O.S.) It's hard to say Capt'n. \nWURLITZER Take a wild stab! \nPITNEY (O.S.) I'll say enough to destroy this wing. \nWURLITZER The entire wing? \nPITNEY (O.S.)

It's now called 'The Escape of Mickey and Mallory.' Starring me, you, Mallory, and special guest accomplice, Jack- fucked-up-fingers-Scagnetti. (into CAMERA) Okay, Donut, move in for a close up.

So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene. \nSCAGNETTI (slightly out of it) She's in the holding cell, on this floor. \nMICKEY (O.S.)

Deputy #5 won't let go of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off the floor, and puts them in his pocket. \nMickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and slips it into his pants. \nMICKEY Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing. Stand behind me, put your back against mine and extend your arms behind you. \nScagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against Mickey's. \nMICKEY Now if I feel your back move away from mine, you're gonna be ripped apart. Got it? \nScagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey. \nSCAGNETTI Yeah. \nMICKEY Okay, Wayne, step forward. \nWayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun. \nMICKEY Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus against the barrel. \nWayne does. \nMICKEY Grab his arms. \nWayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him. \nMICKEY Either one of you two move, it's gonna be shotgun city.

They go down a few flights. \nAs they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies raise their guns. \nMallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her. \nMALLORY Back off or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll blast him! \nNone of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less likely to start shooting. \nWayne screams. \nWAYNE Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot! Please, please, please... \nWayne continues begging. \nWurlitzer steps forward. \nWURLITZER Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say--- \nMALLORY Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna hear it! \nWURLITZER You have to know--- \nMALLORY I said shut up... \nMallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him in the thigh.

Let's do a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Run down these stairs shootin', go out in a hail of bullets, but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible. \nSuddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan. \nMICKEY We'll do that when all else fails. \nMickey stands. \nMALLORY Hasn't it? \nMICKEY We still got a few tricks up our sleeves. \nMickey confronts the two hostages.

And they shoot or make a move anyway. Now say by some freak accident, you didn't die, you live though it. What would you do? \nMickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall. \nWAYNE What would I do? Me and my network would sue the entire Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for flagrantly disregarding my safety. I'd go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue every man down there personally. I would make it my life's ambition to bring the LA County Jail to its knees. I would do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and the inhumanity that exists here. \nMickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan. Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape around the barrel of his shotgun. \nMICKEY That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people? \nWAYNE On average forty million. \nMICKEY 'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards? \nWAYNE Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R.

Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines.

Day becomes night. 
EXT. THE DOCKS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
A bustling mecca of commerce, the port never sleeps; ships of all shapes and sizes dock, empty their shipment, refilled with return cargo, and slip out into the night. 
A multi-hulled beast of a ship, THE CHAYKA (Seagull) rests dock-side, its bridge guarded by a small army of security guards. 
Overhead, scattered throughout the cranes, are a half-dozen SNIPERS, searching/studying the dockyard. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE HULL - CONTINUOUS 
Cellophane-wrapped pallets of WEAPONS and bales of CASH are carried by forklifts into the center of the hull and bolted to the floor. 
Meanwhile, two dozen high-end, luxury cars enter the hull, each driven into its own reinforced, steel crate, the doors sealed shut behind them. 
As the last WORKER leaves, he shouts into his walkie-talkie. 
WORKER FILL HER UP! 
Overhead, a large chute appears- 
EXT. THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS 
-and the OPERATOR presses a button, sending a seemingly endless stream of grain down into the hull, covering the smuggled goods. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
Chewing on an unlit cigar, the CAPTAIN -60s, enormous, grizzled, salt-and-pepper beard, long, unkempt hair, dressed in denim and leather- studies paperwork at his desk while Iosef paces; a cigarette in one hand, a drink in the other. 
IOSEF How the fuck long do I have to stay down here? 
CAPTAIN Until we are at sea, and even then, your access up top will be limited. 
The Captain's phone rings.   He answers it. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Yes? 
The Captain's face falls, his jaw clenched. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) I'll let him know. Proceed as scheduled. 
The Captain hangs up, finds a match, sparks it to flame, and ignites the tip of his cigar, puffing it like an old steam engine. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Your father... 
IOSEF (SCOFFS) What about him? 
CAPTAIN He is dead. 
Iosef is stunned. 
IOSEF What? 
CAPTAIN I'm sorry.     He was k- 
The Captain is cut off by the intercom which squawks to life, a screaming voice reduced to panicked static. The Captain slaps a hand down onto the call button. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Come again? 
OPERATOR (O.S.) We're taking fire, sir! 
EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS 
A number of security guards lay dead upon the deck -bleeding out from single gunshot wounds- as the others sprint for cover. The Operator leans hard against the call button of the intercom. 
OPERATOR Someone's shooting at u- 
A round slams into the side of the Operator's head, killing him instantly, his body sinking to the deck. 
INT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
The Captain stands, checks the chamber of the LUGER PISTOL at his side, and heads for the door. 
CAPTAIN Until you hear otherwise... stay. 
The Captain exits the cabin and slams the door behind him. Trembling, Iosef latches close the door... 
...and pours himself a tall drink. 
EXT. A CRANE - CONTINUOUS 
A SNIPER searches the yard through his scope, his earpiece overwhelmed by panicked chatter. 
SNIPER This is Alpha. I don't-

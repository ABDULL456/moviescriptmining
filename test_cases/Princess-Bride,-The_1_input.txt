VALERIE "True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God -- 
MIRACLE MAX (retreating) Don't say another word, Valerie. 
VALERIE (turning to Inigo and Fezzik) He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered. 
MIRACLE MAX Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name -- 
VALERIE (pursuing him now) What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck 
MIRACLE MAX (holding his hands over his ears) I'm not listening. 
VALERIE A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- 
MIRACLE MAX Nobody's hearing nothing! 
VALERIE Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck! 
INIGO -- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding. 
VALERIE Humperdinck. Humperdinck -- 
MIRACLE MAX (to Valerie) Shut up -- (now to Inigo) Wait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers? 
INIGO Humiliations galore! 
MIRACLE MAX That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job. 
And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we 
CUT TO: 
THIS LUMP 
It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. 
INIGO (a little appalled) That's a miracle pill? 
Max nods. 
VALERIE (finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? 
MIRACLE MAX An hour. 
VALERIE Yeah, an hour. 
MIRACLE MAX A good hour. Yeah. 
Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. 
INIGO (heading out the door, Fezzik close behind) Thank you for everything. 
MIRACLE MAX Okay. 
VALERIE (waving after them) Bye-bye, boys. 
MIRACLE MAX Have fun storming the castle. 
VALERIE (to Max) Think it'll work? 
MIRACLE MAX It would take a miracle. Bye! 
VALERIE Bye. 
And as they wave, trying to look happy we -- 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY 
on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible. 
FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset, he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully, trying to prop Westley against the wall. 
FEZZIK Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- 
INIGO (absolutely unfazed) What's the difference? (indicating the half- dead Westley) We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. 
FEZZIK Has it been fifteen minutes? 
INIGO We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. 
During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. 
INIGO Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. 
FEZZIK (following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. 
INIGO Your guess is as good as mine --

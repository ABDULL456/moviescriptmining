INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR NO. 2 - WITH AIRLOCKS 
Peters leads Starck and DJ down the corridor towards the Forward Airlock bay. They round a corner in time to see a figure moving in the Airlock. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock. He is naked. 
PETERS Justin, no! 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes. He reaches out to the airlock control. 
The pressure door shuts with a HISS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION 
Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull. They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched wiring. 
COOPER We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU. 
SMITH What about the accumulator...? 
Starck's VOICE breaks in: 
STARCK (O.S.) (radio) Miller, come in... 
MILLER What's going on in there, Starck? 
STARCK (O.S.) (radio) Justin's in the airlock. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
Starck at the intercom. The others huddle by the door. 
MILLER (O.S.) (intercom) What? 
STARCK He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit. 
EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION 
MILLER (to Cooper) Stay here! Don't stop working! 
COOPER But Justin... 
MILLER I'll get him. 
Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off into Neptune's thin atmosphere. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
Starck works the airlock control panel without success. 
STARCK He's engaged the override. 
PETERS Can you shut it down? 
She opens the Airlock access panel. 
STARCK I'll try. DJ, you better get your bag of tricks. 
DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door. 
PETERS Justin! Open the door! 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: 
PETERS (muffled) Open the door! 
Justin turns off the artificial gravity. He begins to float gently. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING) 
Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the Event Horizon. 
MILLER I'm on my way, Starck. 
STARCK (O.S.) (radio) You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door. 
Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster... 
BACK TO: 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
Peters, against the window: 
PETERS (muffled) The door, Justin! Open the door! 
He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:

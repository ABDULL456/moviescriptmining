DOWNS Aliens. 
GLASSE You shitting me? 
Stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and titans towering over mortals. 
HOLLOWAY I think all our mythologies are race- memories of the Engineers. Horus the Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of smoke. The Engineers are the gods. 
Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy. 
KAMAROV The mythology gods maybe. God is God. 
STILLWELL Kamarov. Let him talk. 
Stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying. 
STILLWELL (CONT'D) So we're going to meet these things? 
WATTS We probably won't meet anyone. You'd expect a star-traveling race to generate radio or laser signals. Fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures. But Zeta Two Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers have gone missing on Earth. 
WATTS (CONT'D) By the pattern, they should've come to Earth seventeen centuries ago. And again six centuries ago. But no sign. After twelve thousand years...they stopped coming. 
BRICK Why? 
HOLLOWAY Exactly. Why? 
JANEK "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 
They turn. Janek grins at Holloway across the cargo bay. 
JANEK (CONT'D) Is that the question you've come light- years to answer? 
HOLLOWAY Only my first question. I have many. 
EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM) 
The Magellan arrives at the periphery of the system. A distant star like Earth's Sun, surrounded by orbiting planets: mere sparks at this distance. 
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE 
Outside the vast Bridge window, the star Zeta2 Reticuli burns, a cold beacon in the night. Downs, Glasse and Brick sit at consoles. Janek paces in front of the window. 
Holloway and Watts enter - and gape at the view. Janek grins at their reaction. 
JANEK Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of the system. Open her eyes. 
EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM) 
The Magellan opens its eyes: two immense telescopes emerge from the ship. Irises open to expose huge lenses. 
Antennae deploy: unfurling like wings, gleaming and vast. Sifting vacuum for any whisper of information. 
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE 
Outside the window, the planets orbiting Zeta2 Reticuli are no more than bright stars. 
JANEK Overlay. 
A heads-up display appears, overlaid on the glass. The sun is labeled ZETA2 RETICULI. Markers point out the planets and trace the ellipses of their orbits. 
Like magic, the planets swell into colorful orbs, each labeled: Alpha, Beta, Gamma... 
DOWNS Seven planets. Two hot rocks, two gas giants, three snowballs. Nothing Earthlike. 
Watts grins at Holloway, eyes shining. 
WATTS First humans in the system. 
Vickers walks onto the Bridge with DAVID. 
JANEK Director. Good of you to join us. 
VICKERS What did I miss? 
CAPTAIN JANEK Just getting warmed up. (TO HOLLOWAY) Professor? You know what you want? 
HOLLOWAY EMR scan, thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz. Spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon. Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources. 
CAPTAIN JANEK Man knows what he wants. Run it. 
EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM) 
Twin telescopes spin and zoom. Antennae flex and focus. 
TELESCOPE POV 
The planet nearest the sun rushes closer as the mighty telescopes zoom in. 
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE 
The Magellan's sensors peel planet Alpha like an onion and put it back together again. 
A river of data floods the display, bathing the watchers' faces with light: Chemical compounds, magnetic field lines, lunar orbits, topographical data. 
The scan moves on to the next planet, and the next.

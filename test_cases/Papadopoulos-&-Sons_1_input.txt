25   INT. DAY. THE THREE BROTHERS - RESTAURANT AREA. DAY 6.    25 
We are inside The Three Brothers. We hear a jangle of keys and the door opens. The family walk in led by SPIROS. KATIE still carries her designer clothes bags and shoes, JAMES carries some plants, THEO his laptop and HARRY walks in last. It is an old fashioned fish and chip shop that hasn't traded in 30 years.

SPIROS See. It looks much worse from the outside. 
KATIE It's actually a fish and chip shop. 
JAMES Of course it is you spanner. 
KATIE Daddy. Really? 
THEO What's this? 
THEO picks out an old plaque-mounted stuffed fish. 
SPIROS This is Mr Charles. Our lucky fish. He helped us make the busiest chip shop in London. 
SPIROS takes in a deep breath. 
SPIROS (CONT'D) I can smell the past. Your father and I. Young. The women. Young. Making good money. 
HARRY Wasting it. Gambling it. Losing it. 
SPIROS Happy days. KATIE It's a crack den! 
SPIROS Don't worry. Let me show you the rest. We'll make it homely. Furniture, beds, TV. Come on. Let me show you. So... here is the prep room... 
The children follow SPIROS through the shop. HARRY is left looking at the place, taking it all in. He takes out his mobile and calls.

INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY 
Brian opens the trunk of his old BMW. It's full of stereo boxes marked BRIAN'S "SOUND SPECTRUM". 
INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - CABIN - DAY 
Brian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them. 
STEPHEN People actually used to pay you for this? 
BRIAN Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. 
STEPHEN Sheep don't count. 
BRIAN Yeah? What about Laura -- 
STEPHEN That was never proved. 
Brian moves over to another speaker. 
STEPHEN Why'd you come here, Brian? 
BRIAN I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games? 
STEPHEN (sighs) What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man. 
BRIAN Hey! You don't know me -- 
STEPHEN I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer? 
BRIAN So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood? 
STEPHEN Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it. 
Brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches on the tape player. The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear -- Stephen Bishop. 
BRIAN There's only so much technology can do. (picks up his tool box) Thanks for the beer. 
STEPHEN Thanks for the speakers. 
EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY 
Brian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen. 
BRIAN Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt... 
STEPHEN Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like. 
BRIAN I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know. 
STEPHEN I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow. 
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
A simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing... 
EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING 
Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration. 
INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING 
A pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into Lake Michigan. 
EXT. EL STATION - MORNING 
The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and comes on. 
EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING 
Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights flashing, pull out onto the apron. 
The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey. 
STEPHEN You're too late, probie. 
Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs begin heading down the street. 
BRIAN (chasing) Goddamn it, Stephen... 
Brian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags him aboard. 
INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - DAY 
It's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran. 
AXE Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?

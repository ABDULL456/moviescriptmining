EXT. JACK'S TRUCK EARLY - MORNING 
Jack behind the wheel. Beside him EVAN TWOMBLEY, 60, fleshy, Irish, wearing brand new scarlet wool pants, jacket and cap. He feeds on the misfortunes of others. 
TWOMBLEY It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid. 
JACK Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. 
TWOMBLEY Guaranteed, eh? 
JACK Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. (gestures to gun rack) This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it? 
TWOMBLEY Damn straight! 
Hewitt looks at Twombley's rifle: a Winchester M-94 pump- action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it. Never fired, at least not by Twombley. 
JACK Done much shooting with that rifle yet? 
TWOMBLEY (eyes him) Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it. 
JACK If you get it? 
TWOMBLEY Yeah. 
JACK You might not kill it. 
TWOMBLEY You think so. 
JACK You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it. 
TWOMBLEY You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine. 
JACK Mmm. 
TWOMBLEY You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck. 
JACK I get it. (disdain) No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time. 
TWOMBLEY And you'll get your extra hundred bucks. 
JACK (smiles) Wonderful! 
The pickup disappears behind a curve of pine and spruce trees. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING 
Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district school bus into the parking lot. Noisy, jostling grade schoolers emerge from the bus. Jill's former classmates. Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and trucks are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; a woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!" 
Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious -- or just plum contrary. 
A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop. 
The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips to one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes. 
Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over: 
LUGENE Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up? 
WADE Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

ED You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- 
ERIN "Fun?"  Jesus, "fun?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?" 
ED Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- 
ERIN Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is. 
She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it. 
ERIN (weakened) How dare you take that away from me. 
ED No one's taking anything -- 
ERIN Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get. 
By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in the conference room. 
ED Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ... 
ERIN Perks?  Jesus -- perks? 
Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone. 
ERIN If this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect, you can take it and shove it up your ass. 
She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY 
Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage. 
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way. 
ERIN Holy shit -- 
She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark. She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS. 
Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit, is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night. 
ERIN Matthew -- 
She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk, blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him. 
ERIN Matthew!  MATTHEW! 
She catches up and collars him. 
ERIN God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here? 
MATTHEW I'm gonna go live with George. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over her, barely containing herself. 
ERIN If you leave here real fast, I might not kill you. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed. 
ERIN We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise. 
MATTHEW You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised. 
ERIN I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short. 
MATTHEW You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more. 
ERIN Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing. (beat) I promise. 
She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and inches away from her. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 
A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk. 
GEORGE I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They brought her in in an ambulance? 
INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY 
The kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR. 
GEORGE Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis? 
DOCTOR It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain. 
GEORGE Jesus. 
DOCTOR She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now. 
GEORGE How does someone get meningitis? 
DOCTOR Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

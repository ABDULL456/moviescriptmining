Tamara shakes her head. She separates herself from him and stands. 
ANDY Then get Ben to take you to London. Make sure he looks after you. Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead. 
TAMARA I don't want to be with Ben. She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks off. 
171B INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 171B 
Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and shoves them in his case. His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it down. 
172 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 172 
Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She 
MOUTHS: 
JODY Pap me! Pap me! Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh. Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her wish has come true. 
172A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE COURTYARD. 172A 
An ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard. The police are carrying the corpse, covered in blankets. Andy crosses the yard to the barn. He bumps into Glen furtively coming out of the door. Glen's case is packed. 
ANDY What are you doing? Glen can't look him in the eye.

GLEN I figured I'd best, you know, take myself off. She doesn't want writers around the place now. And police, autopsies, not my thing -

ANDY You can't run away. 
GLEN I'm not running away! I just finished my book; my time here is up. Destiny calls. 
ANDY Beth is asking for you. 
GLEN She's... Really? 
ANDY She's on her own over there. Glen, she doesn't need a writer around the place. She needs a man.

175 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 175 
Beth is sitting, still pale with shock, her hands around a mug of tea. Glen approaches. 
GLEN I'm so sorry. Beth looks up at him despairingly. 
GLEN Do they... suspect anyone? I mean of like Foul Play? 
BETH It was my fault. I let the dog go! 
GLEN No, no... 
BETH I shooed him away! The police said it was an accident but... 
GLEN It wasn't your fault! 
BETH What I don't understand is why was he in that field anyway? He hated cows. And when they were coming, why didn't he get out of their way?

GLEN Beth. I have to tell you... 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 110-111. 
For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance. Glen opens his mouth to speak. 
GLEN (CONT'D) You live in the country. You share it with those dangerous beasts. And when they're scared, they run. Like we do... Glen is full of horror at his lie. But Beth is only grateful. 
BETH Glen. Stay with me. Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future together. Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all. Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret. As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs. 
176 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 176 
Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her. 
TAMARA Don't say anything. 
ANDY Kind of suits you. And I always did like the old one. They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts. Tamara is leading Andy up to the house. 
TAMARA You did it on purpose, didn't you? 
ANDY What? 
TAMARA Made it so beautiful I'd never be able to leave. 
ANDY Been dying to get rid of you. This is my house. I was born in that room.

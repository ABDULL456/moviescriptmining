EXT. BUICK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car. 
HALLENBECK Let's get him inside and tie him up. JIMMY Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You don't punch cops! HALLENBECK I forgot.    Hurry up. 
INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER The cop is bound and gagged in the corner.      Unconscious. Hallenbeck moves hurriedly. Not a second to waste. Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer. Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy. HALLENBECK Wear that. He strips off his own shirt.   Crosses to the closet. HALLENBECK You know how to use a gun? JIMMY The trigger's the little black thing. HALLENBECK Here. He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black cylinders. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards. JIMMY What are you gonna use? HALLENBECK A little souvenir... He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest. HALLENBECK Go bring the car around. 
EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn. Pulls up short. Stares ahead at: 
HIS POV - TWO BLACK SEDANS parked at the curb. 
BACK TO SCENE He starts to cry out -- And a dark figure looms behind him. Clubs him in the head. 
INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME Hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle. Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker. Hears a NOISE. Looks up, expecting Jimmy -- Draws a sharp breath: 
PABLO AND ASSORTED GOONS standing in the doorway. All of them have guns. Pablo grins, shakes his head: PABLO Face it, pal.    You're fucked by God. CUT TO: 
PAD AND PAPER as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck. He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin. PABLO Are you a literate man, Joe? HALLENBECK I got a subscription to Jugs magazine. PABLO That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story. 
A GOON sticks his head in the door. GOON We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk. PABLO Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished. The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict: Bad. PABLO Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself. HALLENBECK Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts. PABLO Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered. HALLENBECK What cop? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Pablo draws his pistol. PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner. PABLO That one. HALLENBECK You son of a bitch...! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare. 
Then Joe does something very odd. He says, softly: HALLENBECK We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom...? There is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice. HALLENBECK (as Furry Tom) No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass. Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven- triloquism.

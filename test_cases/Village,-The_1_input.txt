Ivy:  Christop... you needent be scared.  We have the magic rocks.  They will keep us safe. 
Christop:  Why have we not heard of these rocks before? 
Finton:  Christop, please, do not leave us. 
Ivy:  There is nothing to fear. 
Christop:  Then why do you wear the cloak of the safe color? 
Ivy:  We will light torches.  It will be safe. 
Christop:  It is forbidden. 
Finton:  Christop... 
Christop turns and leaves. 
Ivy and Finton stretch a tarp between some trees.  It is raining hard.  They sit underneath the tarp, waiting for the rain to stop.  There are noises from around them in the woods.  The rain freezes on the branches.  The forest is bare. 
Finton:  Ivy...  There's something in these woods.  It turns my stomach to rot. 
He takes her hand and puts it on the bag of magic rocks. 
Finton:  You will be safe.  They will not harm you, because you cannot see.  They will take pity on you, the way they took pity on Noah, when... when he ventured into the woods.  They will kill me, Ivy.  I cannot stay.  You're better in these woods than most boys.  Anyone would say so. 
Ivy:  It is MY burden, Finton.  You may go.

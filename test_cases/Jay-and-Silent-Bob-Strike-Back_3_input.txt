CHRISSY The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals. 
MISSY You are so nasty. 
CHRISSY I'll show you nasty, you little slut. 
SISSY Would you two get a room? 
CHRISSY Fine--we'll take yours. (getting up in Sissy's face) I am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch. 
Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls her eyes. 
SISSY Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure. 
JUSTICE They're your gang. 
SISSY Oh and not yours? You know, I don't get you, Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag. 
JUSTICE We all gotta grow up some time. 
SISSY If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos. 
JUSTICE Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys? 
SISSY Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower? 
Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas. 
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY You the gals that ordered the pizzas? 
SISSY This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian. 
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY No charge, lady.  He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars. 
JUSTICE (quietly) I'm sorry, Jay. 
INT. DINER--DAY 
Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne digs into a banana split. 
JAY You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her memory. 
Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their food. 
JAY Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat?  And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something. You know what I say? (singing, a la NWA) 
VOICE (O.S.) (via bullhorn) THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER THE ORANGUTAN! 
Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then-- 
JAY You think they're talking to us? 
EXT. DINER--DAY 
There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other COPS. 
SHERIFF YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY. (to other COPS) Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty. 
Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn. 
SHERIFF The ape. 
WILLENHOLLY What? 
SHERIFF An orangutan's a member of the great ape family. It's not a monkey. 
WILLENHOLLY Look, who's the Federal Wildlife Marshal here? (into bullhorn) JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT! 
INT. DINER--DAY 
Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, like scared rats. 
JAY What the fuck are you waiting for? Go out there and give 'em the monkey. 
Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked. 
JAY Oh, what, man? I said that shit before I knew they were gonna shoot us! Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't takin' no bullet for no monkey! 
Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay rolls his eyes.

David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes. 
Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back. 
KORBEN (friendly) Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my flight! (to David) Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt? 
DAVID (freaking) Uh... yeah. 
KORBEN (smiling) Great! Now beat it! 
Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant. 
KORBEN Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card. 
He looks at David's fake ID. 
KORBEN ...My cousin David... 
Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (looking at Leeloo's ID) Your wife? 
Korben grabs the ID and reads it. 
KORBEN Uh, yes... Newlyweds. (aside) You know how it is... Love at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you hardly know each other. Right, darling? 
Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand. 
LEELOO (sharply) Dinoine chagantakat! 
KORBEN Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. (to Check-in Attendant) It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. 
He winks at the stewardess. 
ANGLE ON: 
The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared. 
COP (to pig) 
Come on, snyffer, go root! 
The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack. Cornelius sits at a bar. 
CORNELIUS (to the bartender) I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile... So human. You know what I mean? 
The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink. 
ANGLE ON: 
The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in attendant. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (surprised) Dallas... Korben... 
NEIGHBOR (in a different voice) Yes, that's me. 
The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on their faces, revealing two other faces: 
Mangalores. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (smiling) Just a minute, please. 
She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong. 
NEIGHBOR We'll be right back ... we're gonna check out the duty free... 
They spin around and hurry away. 
ANGLE ON: 
Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag. 
ROBOT The same? 
CORNELIUS Yeah... 
DAVID (V.O.) Make that two... 
Cornelius turns to David. 
CORNELIUS Where's Leeloo? 
DAVID On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. 
CORNELIUS It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here! 
He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck. 
CORNELIUS Here's the key to the Temple.. Prepare for our arrival! 
Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot, and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are very nervous. A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them. 
NEIGHBOR (to the tawdry girl) Tell Aknot plan A flopped. Tell him to go to plan B. 
The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears. 
COP (into walkie-talkie) ...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7! 
ANGLE ON:

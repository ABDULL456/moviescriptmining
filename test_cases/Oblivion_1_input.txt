(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He notices an old PAY TELESCOPE next to him, bent and rusted. He puts his eyes to the lenses. Nothing. Black. He STARES at the 25-cent slot on top, lost in a deep sense of Deja-Vu... 
VICTORIA Jack, you're right on top of it. What do you see? Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot... finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish. He traces the path of the wire... up. 
EXT. TOP OF THE ESB ANTENAE - LATER 
JACK has made an arduous climb to discover a TRANSMITTER, hooked to an old MILITARY REPEATER, and both hooked to... we look up as Jack does... the RUSTED, DAMAGED, ESB Antenna atop the building. 
JACK Bob, give me audible on this signal. Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
At the bubbleship, Jack watches the frequency analysis of the signal play on his heads-up. He touches the screen and the signal goes quiet. 
VICTORIA What did you find? 
JACK It's an old radio system. It's been reactivated. 
VICTORIA Define reactivated. Jack looks at the batteries, the wire... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) Jack, that signal's going out over the whole territory. You need to blow the structure. 
JACK It's the Empire State -- 
VICTORIA It's ancient history, Jack. You know the procedure. Blow it. He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage, starts to set them... He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope. Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and SEVERS the lines. The signal dies. 
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
The Bubbleship lifts off. Jack can't help staring down at the Observation Deck as the ship lifts into the air. 
TNT. BUBBLESHIP - DAY Jack is in the air, troubled. Up ahead in the distance we see a LARGE NATURAL RIDGE. Some instruments light up. 
VICTORIA Check your course, you're headed right at the border. 
JACK Yeah, I may have seen another drone trap... 
INTERCUT VICTORIA She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic radiation levels constantly monitored. A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin. 
VICTORIA You're at the edge of range, Jack. You're starting to break up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK It's okay -- 
VICTORIA 
(SERIOUS) No, it's not okay. You get in too close that radiation -- 
JACK -- will cook me from the inside before I know it. Don't worry, I'm still more than five clicks from the beacons... IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull- and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings. Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS. Victoria's voice barely coming through. 
VICTORIA What are -- you ---- out there Jack? The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze, but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar.

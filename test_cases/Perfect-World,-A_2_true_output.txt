Adler looks at the map. ADLER Looks like you was right, Red. He's off the farm to market and onto a spur. Whattaya' wanna' do? RED Beef up the I-20 roadblock. Adler gets more news through the headsets. ADLER What's that? (beat) Red, the locals wanna' know if they're to take a clean shot if they get one? Red stares out the window for what seems like an eternity... 
RED No. Adler looks quizzically at Red and pulls off the headphones... RADIO VOICE (V.O.) Come back...? Come back Mobile One. Adler, are you there...? RED Tell 'em what I said. ADLER (into mike) Uh... no. RADIO VOICE (V.O.) Was that a negative? (CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                72 ADLER No, er, yes. No means negative.     Same thing. Over. Red sees Sally peering at him over the top of her file.      He glances around at the other sets of eyes. RED I don't want some half-ass Sergeant York taking pot shots with a deer rifle. Adler puts the headphones back on. Bobby Lee smirks a bit. 
SALLY It's the only thing to do.    He's got the child with him. Red gives her a look that says, "Don't defend me". BOBBY LEE (to Sally) I suppose you figger' he'll jus' give up. SALLY Maybe, maybe not. BOBBY LEE Well now there's a safe bet. SALLY I'll give you a safe bet. The boy's in better hands now than he was. RED The third eye Pugh's sportin' on the way to the morgue shouts otherwise. Sally flashes Red a look back. Bobby Lee rises and moves past Red on his way to the toilet. BOBBY LEE (casually) Then why not shoot to kill. Red just stares at Bobby Lee as the younger man moves slowly past him to the toilet. Adler on the radio... (CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                  72 ADLER (to Red) They've forwarded the stolen vehicle license to the roadblocks. You still wanna' go to the farm? Red pulls out a package of Red Man chewing tobacco and mulls over the question while he slaps a wad into his cheek. RED Yeah.     I gotta' hunch. 73   INT. FORD - DAY                                                   73 BUTCH You got blue eyes don'tcha', Phillip? Never met a blue-eyed Phillip before. Who you named after? PHILLIP My daddy. BUTCH You and your old man get along all right? PHILLIP Yeahsir. BUTCH Toss the ball around, play grab-ass in the yard, that sorta' thing? PHILLIP Nawsir. BUTCH Why the hell not? PHILLIP He ain't around, really. BUTCH Well he is or he ain't.       When's the last time you saw him? Phillip shrugs. BUTCH Me'n you got a lot in common, Phillip. The both of us got blue eyes, we both like RC Cola and neither one of us has an old man worth a damn. (CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED:                                                         73 PHILLIP (a bit defensive) My Mama says he'll prolly' come back. Prolly' when I'm ten or so. BUTCH Well... she's lyin' to ya' pure and simple. He ain't never comin' back. Disappointment registers on the boy's face. BUTCH Guys like us, Phillip, we gotta' be on our own. Seek foolish destiny, that sorta' thing. 
74   EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                             74 The Ford pulls off the dusty road and into the lone pump in this dilapidated petrol mirage. A BUCK TOOTH BOY, 15, in overalls steps to the window. BOY What can I do ya' for? BUTCH (to Phillip) Tell him your name. PHILLIP Phillip. BOY Fill-er-up it is. The attendant starts to pump the gas.

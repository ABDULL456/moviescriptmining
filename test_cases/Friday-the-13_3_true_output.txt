ALICE (continuing) I'll see you later. 
She turns to go up the steps to her front door. 
BILL Alice? 
She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares. 
ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it wasn't easy for BILL to say. 
ALICE You're very nice. 
They share a short silent moment. 
BILL Hope you will. 
BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long blade. 
ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin. 
CUT TO: 
54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY 
In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere. 
ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her. 
The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side. 
ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier.  She smiles at herself. 
She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel. 
ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe. 
She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door. 
CUT TO: 
55    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY 
ALICE heads from her cabin to the showers. 
CUT TO: 
56    INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY 
ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down. 
She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there. 
Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there. 
Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there. 
ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack. 
There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away. Her scream is loud. 
CUT TO: 
57    EXT. MAIN CABIN - DAY 
BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears ALICE. 
ALICE (O.S.) Help!

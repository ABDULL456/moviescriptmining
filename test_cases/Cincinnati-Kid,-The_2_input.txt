There is a KNOCK on the door. 
MELBA Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed hero. 
CAMERA PANS to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door, talking as she goes. 
MELBA Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own. 
She has paused at the door to finish her sentence. Now she unlocks and opens it -- to Christian. Melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his tracks. After a moment Christian advances into the room. 
REVERSE ANGLE - CHRISTIAN IN F.G. 
The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating. CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba. The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances. 
CHRISTIAN Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba. (a pause) You said wait home 'til you let me know. 
THE KID Yeah, that's what I said. We took a break in the game to catch some sleep. Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up. 
MELBA Yeah, I woke him up. 
CHRISTIAN It don't take much. 
MELBA No, I didn't find it any trouble. (awkwardly) Well, you children don't need me, that's for sure. See you downstairs. (to Christian) You, too, honey, right? 
CHRISTIAN I'll be around if The Kid wants me. 
THE KID See you, Melba. Thanks. 
MELBA Por nada, as they say. It was nothing. 
She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers. 
THE KID You been to the place? 
CHRISTIAN No, I've got my bag downstairs. Maybe I'll take it over later on tonight. 
THE KID How's your Mama and Papa? 
CHRISTIAN Fine. How's the game going? 
The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap. 
THE KID It's come to be just me and Lancey. 
He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on. 
CHRISTIAN (after the kiss) I was wondering. 
THE KID I got my mind on the cards. 
CHRISTIAN I know. And I don't want to rattle you. We got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait. Except I want to say this. I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with Mama while you're playing your big game. I mean if I'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important. 
To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt. The idea that she can be any use to him against Lancey is one he can't grasp. 
THE KID I'm glad you came, Christian. You got as much right here as anybody. (then) More right, I should have said. 
CHRISTIAN Should you? 
THE KID Hell, yes. The change I come out with when I win this one, you're going to be the one to spend it. 
He moves toward the door. 
CHRISTIAN Eric -- 
THE KID (turning back) Look, I said I'm glad you came -- and that's all until I wrap this up -- I'm a poker player, remember? 
She looks at him. After a moment he exits. She follows. 
CUT TO: 
THE POKER TABLE 
It is evening. Lady Fingers deals a first up card to the two players. The Kid gets an eight, Lancey a jack. 
THE KID The eight'll try two bills. 
LANCEY (turning his card) No stay. 
Lady Fingers scoops up the cards, shuffles them into the rest of the deck, submits it to Lancey for his cut, and deals them another two cards apiece -- all in the space of seconds. The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine. 
THE KID Two hundred.

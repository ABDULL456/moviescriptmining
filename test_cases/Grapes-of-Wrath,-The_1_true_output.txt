TOM What's so funny about it? 
SECOND MAN (sniggering again) What's so funny about it?  I just *been* out there! I been an' *seen* it! An' I'm goin' *back* to starve-- because I ruther starve all over at once! 
PA (angrily) Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers! 
SECOND MAN Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya! 
PA (pulling out handbill) But what about this? 
SECOND MAN I ain't gonna fret you. Go on! 
TOM Wait a minute, buddy. You jus' done some jackassin'! You ain't gonna shut up now. The han'bill says they need men. You laugh an' say they don't. Now which one's a liar? 
SECOND MAN (after a pause) How many you'all got them han'bills? Come on, how many? 
At least three-quarters of the men worriedly reach into their pockets and draw out worn and folded handbills. 
PA But what does *that* prove? 
SECOND MAN Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense? 
There is a long worried silence. The proprietor leans forward angrily. 
PROPRIETOR What are you, a troublemaker? You sure you ain't one a them labor fakes? 
SECOND MAN I swear I ain't, mister! 
PROPRIETOR Well, don't you go roun' here tryin' to stir up trouble. 
SECOND MAN (drawing himself up) I tried to tell you folks sump'n it took me a year to fin' out. Took two kids dead, took my wife dead, to show me. But nobody couldn't tell me neither. I can't tell ya about them little fellas layin' in the tent with their bellies puffed out an' jus' skin on their bones, an' shiverin' an' whinin' like pups, an' me runnin' aroun' tryin' to get work-- (shouting) --not for money, not for wages--jus' for a cup a flour an' a spoon a lard! An' then the coroner came. "Them children died a heart-failure," he says, an' put it in his paper. (With wild bitterness) Heart-failure!--an' their little bellies stuck out like a pig-bladder! 
He looks around at the men, trying to control his emotions, and then he walks away into the darkness. There is an uneasy silence. 
FIRST MAN Well--gettin' late. Got to get to sleep. 
They all rise as at a signal, all moved and worried by the Second Man's outburst. TOM, PA AND CASY move away, worry on their faces. 
PA S'pose he's tellin' the truth--that fella? 
CASY He's tellin' the truth awright. The truth for him. He wasn't makin' nothin' up. 
TOM How about us? Is that the truth for us? 
CASY I don't know. 
PA (worriedly) How can you tell? 
The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the shield marker of U.S. Highway 66 and the rattling Joad truck the signs of towns flash by: AMARILLO, VEGA, GLENRIO. 
The TRUCK is seen on the HIGHWAY. It is now mountain country-- New Mexico. Then it is seen at a GAS STATION. It is a cheap two-pump station, hand-painted, dreary, dusty. Huddled next to it is a hamburger stand. In front of the hamburger stand is a truck labeled: NEW MEXICO VAN AND STORAGE COMPANY. The Joads are piling out of their truck. Directed by Ma, Noah lifts Granma out. The two children scamper around shrieking because their legs have gone to sleep. Al is preparing to put water in the radiator. Pa takes out a deep leather pouch, unties the strings, and begins calculating his money as the fat proprietor advances. 
FAT MAN (truculently) You folks aim to buy anything? 
AL Need some gas, mister. 
FAT MAN Got any money? 
AL Whatta you think:--we's beggin'? 
FAT MAN I just ast, that's all. 
TOM (evenly) Well, ask right. You ain't talkin' to bums, you know. 
FAT MAN (appealing to heaven) All in the worl' I done was ast! 
INSIDE THE HAMBURGER STAND, a standard cheap eatery, Bert is doing the short orders and Mae is handling the counter. A nickel phonograph is playing a tune. Bill, a truck driver, sits at the counter; his partner, Fred, is playing a slot machine.

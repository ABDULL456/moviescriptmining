DR BERGER You saw her once and now you' want to take her on too? 
CONRAD No! 
DR BERGER No? 
CONRAD No. I just... 
DR BERGER What? 
CONRAD That isn't it. I... I feel bad about this, I feel really bad about this. And just let me feel bad about this! 
DR BERGER Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it too. 
CONRAD Why do things have to happen to people? It isn't fair. 
DR BERGER You're right. It isn't fair. 
CONRAD You just do one wrong thing... and... 
DR BERGER Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing you did?

DR BERGER Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying? 
CONRAD I think so. 
DR BERGER You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that. 
CONRAD It doesn't feel good. 
DR BERGER It is good. Believe me. 
CONRAD How do you know? 
DR BERGER Because I'm your friend.

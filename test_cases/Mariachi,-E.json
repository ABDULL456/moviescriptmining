He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly crosses their names out. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Dead? \nThe Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also glances up. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) (into phone) All of them?

BOYSTOWN SALOON DOMINO'S - DAY \nMariachi enters Domino's bar. DOMINO is waiting on a few bar bums that are nursing their jaws. Mariachi sits with them, asks for a refresco, He gets looks again. Domino serves him and he asks to see the owner. She says he's looking at the owner. He then asks her for work as a mariachi. She says she has no money to pay him. He looks arund the classy joint and knows she's lying (it turns out to be true, she has no money). When he asks how a girl can take care of herself in a town like this she stuffs a gun barrel in his mouth. He nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others laugh. \nMARIACHI CHECKS IN TO HOTEL - DAY \n", "test1_id": 582, "test2_input": "Mean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands. \nDOMINO Que paso \nMEAN DUDE #5 I screwed up. The guy left his guitar case in the hotel room. We chased him out, but he came back for the case. \nDOMINO Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique. \nMEAN DUDE #5 It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And thanks for the drink. \nMean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) If you see this guy, call us. \nHe is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up to. She storms upstairs. \nINT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY \nDomino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and walks to the counter. \nDOMINO (friendly) I thought I told you not to touch anything. \nMARIACHI Sorry. I needed to relax. I can... \nDOMINO (smiling) No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo? \nMARIACHI (laying back, closed eyes) Yes, please. \nDomino turns to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious- looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his eyes wide. The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll. \nDOMINO Who are you?! \nMARIACHI (choking) I'm a musician! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops.

My guitar! \nDomino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of the latches with her toe. \nDOMINO We'll see... \nShe unsnaps another. The latches snap loud and echo in the quiet room. Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) You're very modest, Mariachi... \nShe squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) (through gritted teeth) You told me you killed four men, when you really killed seven. Or were they still breathing even after you shot out their hearts? \nAnother latch snaps. \nMARIACHI (groing dizzy) I'm a mariachi... \nSNAP! \nMARIACHI ... not a murderer... \nSNAP! \nDOMINO Aren't you going to watch? \nShe lifts the lid with her foot. It seems an eternity before the case is fully open. Domino is looking into the case, but Mariachi is not. He knows what's in there. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARIACHI I told you... I am a musician. \nSlow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she almost believes he is telling the truth. \nShe rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi. He catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is on the other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down between Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug. \nDOMINO Play it. \nMARIACHI (still choking) W...w...what? \n", "test2_id": 583, "test3_input": "Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly. \nDOMINO Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!! \nMariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) (growing impatient) \nSING! \nMariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts over, playing a \"Rancho Grande\" sounding song with his own made up words. \nMARIACHI (in a high sweet voice) What is this place? That treats me like a murderer? They've all got their heads up their butts... Even this beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss her or hit her... Or both? \nHe finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOMINO You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one. \nMariachi bows a solemn thank you. \nMARIACHI I think this is the best I've ever played. You... inspired me. \nCLOSEUP of the knife. \nShe laughs. \nMARIACHI (CONT'D) Hire me. \nDomino looks at him with a silent \"what?\". \nMARIACHI (CONT'D) I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar. I'll work mostly from tips. But, I need steady work. \nDOMINO I couldn't pay you. I have no money. \nMARIACHI This fancy place and you have no money? \nDOMINO It's the truth. \nMARIACHI I'll work for room and board, then. Please, I'm desperate. \n", "test3_true": "MARIACHI (smiling) Not if you're paying me room and board. Please... until I find a permanent job. \nDOMINO (thinking) You won't find a permanent job in this town... but OK. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nShe gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) You're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're gonna work for me, kid. \nShe flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs. Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips out of the wall and clangs to the ground. Mariachi jumps again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture fades. \nINT. AMADEUS - EVENING \nMariachi plays in Amadeus. \nINT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY \nCamera tracks past a pool table where TWO RATS are playing nine ball. They make a few shots, then the phone rings. The camera continues to track past a small table where Azul's guitar case lies open. Weapons adorn it, with each knife, each gun in its pocket, in its own place. The camera continues tracking to a dresser on which sits Azul's cellular phone. A delicate female hand lifts the receiver. The camera is now positioned above the bed as the GIRL answers the phone. \nGIRL #1 (into phone) Yes? One moment please... \nHe rolls over and wakes a GIRL sleeping beside her. Girl #2 takes the phone and passes it to a third GIRL as Girl #2 tries to wake Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3.). \nGirl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for background conversation. \nThe two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three Girls in Azul's bed. They look hungry and deprived. One hits the other, signaling it's his shot. While one shoots, the other watches. \nAzul awakens and grabs the phone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAZUL (into phone) Yeah. \nEXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMoco is sitting in his pool. A swimming WAITER is bringing him drinks. \nMOCO (into phone) Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've not answered all day. Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming! \n", "test3_id": 584}

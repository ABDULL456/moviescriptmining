{"train": "FADE IN: \nEXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY \nIt's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nThe inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and continues writing. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nAzul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes. \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nA gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nAzul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him. Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El Moco. \nMOCO (V.O.) Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this is? \nAZUL (into phone) Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years? \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila. \nMOCO (into phone) We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you a call, amigo. \nAZUL (V.O) That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money. \nMOCO (into phone) Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime. \nAZUL (into phone) There are two men here with guns. Did you send them? \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMoco, glancing at his watch, hangs up. \nINT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY \nAzul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a corner. \nINT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY \nThe Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter Azul's block and scope out the cells. \nThe Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. He stands ready to fight. \nThe Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them. The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door. \nAzul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number is automatically redialed. \nMoco answers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAZUL (into phone) I'm still here, Moco. And so are your little friends. But not for long. They have something they want to scream to you. Listen close, because you're going to repeat it to me when I come to visit you. \nINT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY \nThe cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell. Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is holding the phone at arm's length into the cell. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming, they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing. As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it. \nEXT. JAIL - DAY \nA blue truck races towards the jail. \nAzul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits patiently for his blue truck. \nAs the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away. Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head. \nBARTENDER (nodding) Tell me, why would I need one little guitar player when I've already got a full band? \nMariachi gives him a silent \"what\" look. \nThe BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small draped table. \nThe Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as... \n... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat. \nThe Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful. \nMariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who seems to enjoy it. \nThe Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) (nodding with satisfaction) There you see? Either I can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band... \nMariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. He looks disappointed. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) ... or I could spend the same money only get one little guitar player... Understand? \nMARIACHI (walking away) Thank you, sir. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBARTENDER You want to earn a living? Get a real musical instrument. \nThe Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES at the table. \nThey all shake their heads no. \nThe Bartender shrugs and dumps it. \nEXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY \nMariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides to walk south. \nAs he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar. \nINT. CORONA CLUB - DAY \nWe work for him. \nAZUL That's too bad. \nAzul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused. \nAZUL (CONT'D) Hold it please. \nAzul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols. \nThe Bartender ducks beneath the counter. \nAzul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case. Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nThe shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He takes a deep breath and rushes out the door. \nINT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY \nThe Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face. \nThe Bartender rises up from behind the counter. \nThe camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood- bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder. \nShot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom. \nAzul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom. \nThe Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself. \nWithout warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves. \nA few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and furiously dials. \n(CONTINUED) \nMEAN DUDE #5 \nDa me telefono. \nVIEJO CLERK (without looking) Take it. \nMean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor. \nMEAN DUDE #5 \nPit bull? \nVIEJO CLERK Yeah, pit bull. \nThe line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly crosses their names out. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Dead? \nThe Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also glances up. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) (into phone) All of them? How long ago? OK, What does this guy look like? \nClerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still paying attention, though. \nEXT. HOTEL CAOHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY \nSame low-angle shot of the outdoor sign displaying the name Hotel Coahuila. Mariachi walks into frame, and pulls out his wallet. Mariachi pulls out a few measly bucks then seems to be considering what to do next. \nINT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY \nAn inside shot looking out of the front glass reveals Mariachi looking at his wallet as Mean Dude talks to the phone. No one notices him. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) ... carries a guitar case... And what was he wearing?... all black... \nThe Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window. Seeing Mariachi, he gets up and walks to it. \nEXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY \nMariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet. As he is walking away he notices the Pit Bull and he bends down for a closer look. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Don't worry, Moco. We'll find him, and we'll mess him up real good. (ad lib) \nEXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY \nMariachi enters the run-down lobby of the motel. The Viejo Clerk at the counter is reading his yellowed newspaper. Mariachi sees the Pit Bull laying by the counter. \nMARIACHI Pit bull. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nVIEJO CLERK Yeah, pit bull. \nMARIACHI I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd prefer to pay you in a few days, after I've found some work. \nVIEJO CLERK S\u00ed, later... \nMARIACHI Thank you... \nThe Old Man hands Mariachi a key for the second floor. \nMARIACHI (CONT'D) Thank you, friend. \nAs Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him. \nVIEJO CLERK (different tone of voice) Uh, excuse me se\u00f1or? I forgot, I need a small deposit... \nMariachi stops in his tracks. He turns back to the Clerk slowly... thinking. \nMARIACHI (walking back slowly) You can trust me. \nVIEJO CLERK I am very sorry, se\u00f1or. But... how much can you spare? \nThe dog is watching the event. \nMARIACHI (disappointed) I've only got a few pesos... I plan on finding work in town. \nVIEJO CLERK (grabbing money) Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and... enjoy your stay. \nThe Clerk deposits the money, slams the register shut, and continues reading his yellow paper. Confused, Mariachi pockets his empty wallet and turns to find his room. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThe Clerk peeks over his paper, eyeing the guitar case as Mariachi goes. He hears the sound of Mariachi's footsteps trailing off. The old man drops the paper and bolts silently to the phone as he dials El Moco's phone number... \nINT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY \nThe men burst into the lobby and the old men tells them the room number. They run out into the courtyard with the old man following. The Pit Bull is uninterested in the action. \nEXT. COURTYARD IN HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY \nThe Mean Dudes run up the courtyard stairs   and kick open the first door they come to and start blasting   into the room. Screams are heard. The men stand back, and   finally look down the steps at the Viejo Clerk who is waving   his arms frantically. \nVIEJO CLERK 127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!! \nThey run to the room numbered 127 and cautiously stalk towards it as they reload their guns. \nINT. MARIACHI'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMariachi is sitting on his bed listening to all this. He bolts to the restroom and turns to the shower. \nEXT.

MARIACHI'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nLow-angle shot as men burst in. There is no one in the room. Mean Dude #5 hears the shower and motions to keep it down and stalk quietly... They rush into the bathroom and start blasting. \nMariachi slips out from behind the door and runs out. \nEXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - DAY \nMariachi runs out of the room and jumps off the stairwell onto the courtyard in front of the Clerk. \nMARIACHI (pointing to his room) Cuidado, viejo! \nDOMINO (lowering the gun a bit) Thieves? \nMARIACHI (nodding) No way. They were well-dressed men. I checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when I left my room, but they didn't. They were only interested in killing me. \nDOMINO (lifting the gun back up) So why do you come here? You want to get me killed? \nMARIACHI I need a place to stay until I figure this out. They've got me mixed up with someone else. \nDOMINO And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARIACHI (long pause) Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? What for? \nDOMINO Maybe they hate your music. \nMariachi stares at her expressionless. She stares back at him. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you. \nMARIACHI Are you serious? \nDOMINO (nodding) Yes. \nShe laughes. \nMARIACHI Are you going to help me, or am I gonna have to die on your porch? \nDOMINO I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't touch anything. I'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine. \nMariachi shakes her hand. \nMARIACHI Thank you. I'll never forget this. \nHe tries to kiss her hand. She slides it away and effortlessly slaps him. \nDOMINO This way. \nHe follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase. When he enters, the darkness swallows him as she shuts the door behind him. \nINT. UPSTAIRS DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY \nMean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands. \nDOMINO Que paso \nMEAN DUDE #5 I screwed up. The guy left his guitar case in the hotel room. We chased him out, but he came back for the case. \nDOMINO Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique. \nMEAN DUDE #5 It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And thanks for the drink. \nMean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) If you see this guy, call us. \nHe is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up to. She storms upstairs. \nINT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY \nDomino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and walks to the counter. \nDOMINO (friendly) I thought I told you not to touch anything. \nMARIACHI Sorry. I needed to relax. I can... \nDOMINO (smiling) No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo? \nMARIACHI (laying back, closed eyes) Yes, please. \nDomino turns to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious- looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his eyes wide. The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll. \nDOMINO Who are you?! \nMARIACHI (choking) I'm a musician! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops. Domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the case toward her. \nDomino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly. \nDOMINO Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!! \nMariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody. \nDOMINO (CONT'D) (growing impatient) \nSING! \nMariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts over, playing a \"Rancho Grande\" sounding song with his own made up words. \nMARIACHI (in a high sweet voice) What is this place? That treats me like a murderer? They've all got their heads up their butts... Even this beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss her or hit her... Or both? \nHe finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOMINO You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one. \nMariachi bows a solemn thank you. \nMARIACHI I think this is the best I've ever played. You... inspired me. \nCLOSEUP of the knife. \nShe laughs. \nMARIACHI (CONT'D) Hire me. \nDomino looks at him with a silent \"what?\". \nMARIACHI (CONT'D) I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar. I'll work mostly from tips. But, I need steady work. \nDOMINO I couldn't pay you. I have no money. \nMARIACHI This fancy place and you have no money? \nDOMINO It's the truth. \nMARIACHI I'll work for room and board, then. Please, I'm desperate. \nAZUL (into phone) Six. \nMOCO (into phone) What? \nAZUL (into phone) I've only killed six! You were always bad at math, Moco. I guess that's why you never paid me half of the money. You thought it all belonged to you. \nMOCO (into phone) I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my friend. It's my nature. But you!!! You are modest! You've killed ten of my men!! I know, because I'm having them buried in my yard right now. With my dogs and cats. \nAZUL (counting on his fingers, into phone) I killed six. But don't bother counting so soon. The number will triple by tomorrow. \nMOCO (into phone) I'm sorry things turned out this way. My friend. I got greedy. I should never have tried to kill you. It would have been cheaper for me to pay you. Now I've got to find ten new men. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAZUL (into phone) Six. \nMOCO (into phone) Ten. \nAZUL (into phone) I tell you what. You give me my money, and I won't kill any more of your men... And I won't kill you. \nMOCO (takes a sip, into phone) No, it's too late for that. We're going to have to see this through. \nAZUL (into phone) Just like the Moco I used to know. Still wearing white? \nMOCO (looking down at his clothes, into phone) What do you think? \nAZUL (into phone) I think you should change clothes. I'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood. \nAzul hangs up. He gets dressed and leaves. The little Rats are about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look at the girls. The girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away. \nINT. AMADEUS - DAY \nDomino walks by with a trash can. Mariachi is sitting on a barstool. \nMARIACHI I need to get my money back from that hotel. I'll be right back. \nDOMINO Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed. Leave that stuff here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe bar Assistant is cleaning the bar. He walks over to grab a few glasses and when he returns, Azul is sitting at the barstool Mariachi was on earlier. The Assistant looks around, wondering where Azul appeared from. \nASSISTANT Can I get something to drink or eat? \nAZUL One beer. \nThe Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap. He fills it halfway when... \nAZUL (CONT'D) In a bottle, wey. \nASSISTANT (laughs) Sorry. \nHe grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug, toasts and drinks it straight down. \nAzul drinks his straight down, too. \nAZUL (looking around) Isn't there a girl that works here? \nASSISTANT Yeah, she owns the place. \nAZUL (heading a few bills to the Assistant) (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: AZUL (CONT'D) She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's girl? \nASSISTANT (looking around) So-so.

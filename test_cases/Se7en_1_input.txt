INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Mills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song. 
INSERT -- TITLE CARD 
TUESDAY 
INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING 
The room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse. 
SANTIAGO If you take a look here, buddies... I can tell you, it was not a poison. If you can see... I have emptied all of everything out of the stomach.  But, look at it, now that I took away the liver. 
Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we don't see in. 
SANTIAGO (CONT) I move the lungs over.  First, see how big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is. Now... here is the strange thing, on the stomach.  Stretches. (pointing) And, here is it distended.  Look at the size of that, because of the foods. 
MILLS I can see what you're pointing at... 
SANTIAGO On the stomach.  The lines of distention. 
Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees. 
SOMERSET Doctor, are you saying this man... ate till he burst? 
SANTIAGO Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He was bleeding, inside of himself. And, there's a hemotoma on the outside... on the belly. 
Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over. 
MILLS He died by eating? 
SANTIAGO Someone punched him, or kicked him. 
Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head. 
He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than others, all about the same diameter as a dime. 
SANTIAGO (CONT) Oh, and there is this here... something else you have to look at and see. 
Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises. 
SANTIAGO (CONT) Most of his stomach contents are in the lab now... but, this.  I found these in the fat man's stomach. 
Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings. 
MILLS Plastic? 
Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset looks at it a long time. 
SANTIAGO Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I don't know. 
INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING 
Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal. 
SOMERSET Those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun. 
MILLS So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave him a choice: eat, or get your head blown off. 
INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING 
Somerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search. 
SOMERSET He was force-fed... till his body started rejecting the food.  He literally couldn't eat another bite. 
MILLS So, the killer held a bucket under him. 
SOMERSET His throat was swollen from the effort. He was bleeding internally. He must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die. 
Somerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on his knees, examines the linoleum floor. 
MILLS You kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon. (touches floor) Somerset, look here. 
Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum. 
SOMERSET Same color and texture. 
They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor. 
MILLS If this is what that is... it doesn't make sense.  It doesn't figure. 
SOMERSET Always look for one thing to focus on. There's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility. 
MILLS How are pieces of the floor going to get in the guy's stomach? 
SOMERSET Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally? 
Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see, these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back at some time. 
INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING 
We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth. It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look -- 
The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease, and a note taped in the center of the circle. 
Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read: 
MILLS "Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light." (looks at Somerset) This is not good. 
SOMERSET Milton. 
MILLS What? 
SOMERSET It's a quote from a book.  Milton's Paradise Lost. 
Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.

ALEC They hardly impressed me as the gang bang type, Jules. Now much coke have you done? 
JULES Shovels full. They've got barrels. 
ALEC You're just paranoid from the coke. You know sometimes I think you just make up these dramas to test me or something.

JULES And waste all this good coke! As Jules connects with her number, Alec starts to head out of the hotel in disgust. A beautiful older woman is getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him toward the elevators. She and Alec check each other out. He smiles. She smiles. As her elevator, arrives, she changes her mind and, giving Alec an inviting smile, steps into the dimly-lit bar. Alec is torn between morality and temptation. Temptation wins as he follows the sexy lady.

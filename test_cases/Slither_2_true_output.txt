STARLA Grant, where'd you go? 
BILL Hey, Grant. 
Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla. 
GRANT You ready, sugarplum? 
Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths: 
STARLA Bye. 
Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him. 
WALLY Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long. 
BILL Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you... 
Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember. 
WALLY What? 
BILL Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass. 
They both LAUGH. 
INT. GRANT BEDROOM - LATER 
Starla lies on her side, awake. She's staring at the dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet. Grant holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully. 
FADE TO: 
INT. WHEELSY POLICE STATION - DAY 
The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused Mexican MAN walks inside. He is trying to keep from crying. Three half-naked children follow him, clutching onto his clothes. The man walks slowly through the office, looking around for help. 
Margaret sees him from her desk. 
MARGARET Sir, may I help -- ? 
BRENDA'S HUSBAND My wife, Brenda. I think something has happened to her! 
EXT. STOP SIGN - DAY 
Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign. She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that it's covered with flyers for missing pets. 
INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 
Starla enters with a shopping bag.    The lights are off. CREEPY MUSIC plays. 
STARLA Grant? 
No answer.    Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing happens. 
STARLA Damn fuse. 
She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock. 
INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around. 
STARLA Grant? 
Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent. 
She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs. 
INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her husband. It seems no one is here. 
STARLA Grant, where are y -- ? 
Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla, startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But, worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules all over his face. 
STARLA Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ? 
GRANT Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days. 
Starla stares at him, mute and horrified. 
GRANT Don't look at me like that, baby. Please? I'm gonna go get my... prescription filled.

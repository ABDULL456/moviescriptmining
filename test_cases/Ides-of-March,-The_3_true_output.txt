GOV. MORRIS Listen Stephen...you're not Paul. I pay him to use the word "great". I pay you to tell me the truth. 
STEPHEN I think we're solid. GOV. MORRIS Okay Paul. STEPHEN Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win. 
GOV. MORRIS But you wouldn't. STEPHEN I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause. 
GOV. MORRIS You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work. STEPHEN Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it. GOV. MORRIS So at best you've got eight years...then you'll end up with a nice little consultant firm on Farragut North...eating at the Palm...pulling in seven hundred and fifty grand a year...pimping out Senators to Saudi Princes. They both smile. 
STEPHEN Pimping out ex presidents... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
GOV. MORRIS Then I better win... 
STEPHEN Yeah. CUT TO: 
INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - OHIO - LATER 
We're in a large hall. GOVERNOR MORRIS is on stage, he stands in front of a huge American flag. Morris's wife CINDY is standing in the wings along with their seven year old daughter BETH. GOVERNOR MORRIS addresses the crowd. 
GOV. MORRIS Now, I've been married for eleven years, to the smartest person I know...and we have a normal marriage...which means when we disagree...she wins. What we don't ever disagree on is how we're going to leave this planet for our daughter. Are we gonna leave it better off, or worse? The richest people in this country don't pay their fare share. And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth. That scares everybody and they all run and they hide. For the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans, by our government! And I will run on that! 
INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
PAUL and STEPHEN are back stage behind the huge American flag. We can hear the Governor's speech in the B.G. STEPHEN I didn't think it was true. PAUL Whoa... 
STEPHEN But I should have told you this yesterday...sorry... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
PAUL -Slow down. 
STEPHEN I met with Tom Duffy yesterday. PAUL What? STEPHEN You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you... PAUL Stop Stop let me get this straight. You met with Tom Duffy? 
STEPHEN Yes. 
PAUL What'd he want Stephen? STEPHEN -the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State. 
CUT TO: INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
GOV. MORRIS You know how you fight the war on terror?...Don't need their product anymore. Their product is oil, just don't need it and they go away. We don't have to bomb anyone we don't have to invade anyone! CUT TO: 
INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
PAUL If this is some sort of practical-I mean -my fucking blood pressure is going through the roof right now.

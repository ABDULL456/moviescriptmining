Her two police guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye out. \nCLOSE ON SIDNEY \nHer face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the computer screen in front of her. \nON THE MONITOR \nSid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words. \nON SIDNEY \nConfused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She leans back, turning to the GUY next to her.

She turns to the monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP. \nON THE UPPER LEVEL \nDewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge. He approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light. \nHe reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod. It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare. \nDewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks up to him. \nGALE Dewey? \nDEWEY There's nothing. I'm coming down. \nDewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.

Dewey looks down to see the Ghost standing directly behind Gale. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) Watch out! \nDOWN BELOW \nGale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it darts out of the darkness.

SOUND STAGE - SAME \nGale finds herself in the student studios. She stands in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage. Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality. \nGale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room. Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are heard, making their way towards her. \nGale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the... \nGHOST FIGURE \nThat stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS. She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the control booth. She's protected by a clear, large, plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying to secure it. There's no lock. \nAT THE MAIN DOOR \nDewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he immediately spots Gale. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nGale looks for objects to block the door with. She drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door. \nOUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nDewey moves to the window. \nDEWEY Gale! Gale! \nShe doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nGale shoves everything she can find against the door, not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the sound proof barrier behind her. \nShe also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE \nGale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is terrified.

She moves to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes reveal it. \nGale BEATS against the glass window. \nGALE (through tears) NOOOOOOO! \nDewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made his way through the control booth. He's coming for her. She races to the door, throws the things away. \nShe manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through. And she's off and running. \nGale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only long enough to lock it. \nBAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it holds. Gale surveys her surroundings.

Everybody is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying, strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out. \nSid runs to them. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Oh God, help me. We have to call the police. \nSid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has no comprehension skills at all. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Do you have keys? I need to get inside. \nSid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Shit! \nSid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves them, moving down off the porch and around to the back of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's locked too. \nSidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots a big tree with a... \nBODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She moves toward it. \nAs Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still chained to the tree. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Mickey? Mickey? \nA look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there very much dead. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Oh God, no, Mickey... \nShe kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up, rising.

{"train": "Scream 2 Screenplay by         Kevin Williamson \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT \nAn old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front reads: \n\"SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT 'STAB' Rated R\" \nA line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS - mostly college age. \nCLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart. \nMAUREEN I hate scary movies. \nPHIL It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. \nMAUREEN If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. \nPHIL We got free tickets. \nHe pulls her close, snuggling with her. \nEXT. BOX OFFICE \nMaureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their tickets. \nThey pass through the front doors where an USHER stands randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation of a most familiar one. Phil takes one. \nMAUREEN What's that? \nUSHER The studio sent them. \nINT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER \nThe small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS. Everyone is having fun. \nMaureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in terror. A very lively crowd. \nON SCREEN \nCredits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo appears followed by... \n\"A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM\" \nIN THE THEATRE \nMaureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil has slipped it on. \nMAUREEN I don't think so. \nPhil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him. \nMAUREEN Take it off. \nPHIL But... \nMAUREEN Now. \nHe obliges. \nON SCREEN \nMore credits. \n\"BASED ON THE BOOK \"THE WOODSBORO MURDERS\" BY GALE WEATHERS\" \nMaureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre. The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked. \nON SCREEN \nThe movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere. Lights burn from within. \nInside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the curtain. It's all very PSYCHO. \nMAUREEN Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? \nPHIL Sssshhh. \nON SCREEN \nThe phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone. \nGIRL Hello? \nPHIL You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay. \nHe's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her. She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual. \nMAUREEN I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence. \nPHIL (nibbling her neck) We can still Sandra Bullock it. \nMAUREEN (nibbling back) Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away. \nPHIL. Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me upstairs? \nMAUREEN Want some popcorn? \nPHIL Butter. \nMaureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns, reaching for the bathroom door just as a... \nGHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER \nMaureen is at the concession. A GIRL at the counter hands her change and Maureen is off with soda and a tub of popcorn. \nINT. DARK THEATER - SECONDS LATER \nSCREAMS and GASPS from the audience as the movie plays on. \nON SCREEN \nA patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room. \nIN THE THEATER \nThe crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. \"You dumb bitch. Get out of the house.\" etc. \nMaureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits down next to... \nPHIL \nWho sits with the mask on. The reflection from the movie bouncing against it in the darkness. \nMAUREEN Give it up. \nShe sits down, with the popcorn. \nMAUREEN How many stabs did I miss? \nON SCREEN \nThe young girl slips out a side door, completely terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone. \nIN THE THEATER \nMaureen offers Phil popcorn. \nMAUREEN Why doesn't she run? \nPhil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked lips, SSSHHING her. \nON SCREEN \nThe young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running... \nIN THE THEATER \nEveryone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn. \nMAUREEN This is so tired. \nShe turns her attention to Phil. \nMAUREEN Hey, you... pasty face... \nPhil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead. \nMAUREEN Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your ghost? \nON SCREEN \nThe young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she SCREAMS... \nIN THE THEATER \nVOICE Hello Sidney. \nA VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting. Sidney doesn't flinch. \nSIDNEY Yes? \nVOICE What's your favorite scary movie? \nSIDNEY Who is this? \nVOICE You tell me. \nSidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She takes a look at its display. \nSIDNEY Cory Gillis. 442-8730. \nSilence. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M... \nCLICK! The phone goes dead. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Enjoy the movie. \nShe hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie. \nHALLIE Time to change numbers again? \nSIDNEY Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes. \nSidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on their small TV. Snippets are heard. \nREPORTER (from TV) \"... The two victims, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens...\" \nThe channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed. Attractive, sullen. Sad. \nYOUNG MAN (from TV) Please, I just wanna be left alone. \nHis voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the television. \nHALLIE He sure gives a lot of interviews for someone who wants to be left alone. \nHallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles. \nHALLIE Get your ass in gear. You're late. Don't forget we've got rush at the Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid? \nSidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost. Recovery is immediate. \nSIDNEY I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek. \nSid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops herself. \nIt's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to Hallie, throwing the costume at her. \nSIDNEY Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think? \nSid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door, leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER \nSid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER. \nREPORTER #2 Sidney, did you know the victims? \nREPORTER #1 Do you feel responsible for the murders? \nSIDNEY What murders? \nMicrophones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to panic. \nREPORTER #3 Do you think there will be more murders? \nSidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is no escape. The questions come at her like lightning. She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick sunglasses, moves in her way. \nFLASHY REPORTER Did you kill them last night, Sid? Has it gotten to you? Have you finally snapped? \nSidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when... \nBAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She drops. Sid spins around to find... \nGALE WEATHERS \nStanding, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick moment. Sidney is happy to see her. \nGale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van fussing with equipment. \nGALE (CONT'D) I need two minutes at six o'clock. I wanna do a piece on the slain kids - no sympathy shit - let's stick with the movie angle. I wanna pull a clip from an old film... \nGale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers. \nGALE (CONT'D) Hey, what was the name of that movie? \nThe guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older but still the charming jokester. \nRANDY HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA. 1980. Tom Hanks' first film. \nGALE (CONT'D) (into phone) HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find it. Don't worry, I've got it covered... I have a plan. Yeah, I'll get it. Give it a rest - I said I'll get it. Later. \nShe hangs up, turning to Randy. \nGALE (CONT'D) Pressure's on. You ready for this? \nRANDY I'm there, man. No worries. I got ya covered. I'm so there. That's why I'm here - because I'm there. \nRandy holds up his camera - stoked. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER \nSidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school building. Through open doorways, film equipment is glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film Department. \nShe comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room, a class is in progress. She slips in quietly. \nINT. CLASSROOM - SAME \nSidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a point. \nSNOTTY GUY Sequels are too handicapped. By definition alone, they're inferior films. \nHallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic, cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped. \nMICKEY Bullshit generalization. Many sequels have surpassed their original. \nSNOTTY GUY Name one. \nMICKEY ALIENS Far better than the original. \nANOTHER GUY Subjective. \nSOME GIRL Life's subjective. I much prefer Ridley Scott. \nThe conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN. \nHALLIE No way. ALIENS rocked. \"Stay away from her - you bitch.\" \nSNOTTY GUY I'll give you that one. Name another. \nMICKEY T2. \nSOME GIRL You've got a hard-on for Cameron. \nSNOTTY GUY A bigger budget does not make a better movie. TERMINATOR one is historical. \nSomeone screams out, \"You Sarah Connor?\" as the TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up. \nARTSY TEACHER How about THE GODFATHER PART II? \nOoooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in agreement. \nSNOTTY GUY The almighty exception. Name another. \nA YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the conversation. His name is Derek. \nDEREK EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story. Improved effects. \nFrom the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated. \nHALLIE I liked JEDI. With the furry things. \nEveryone BOO'S. \"Ewoks blow.\" \nMICKEY Lucas and his Romper Room stage. \nHALLIE I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20. \nSNOTTY GUY Case in point. The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels. \nARTSY TEACHER Really? And why do you think that is? \nStudents and concerned faculty stand. Among them are Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very intelligent face. \nDEREK But what are they doing? He's talking but he's not saying anything. \nJOEL Sounds like they don't know anything. \nHALLIE Do you think they'll cancel Hell Week? \nMICKEY You're getting nailed - you're not getting out of it. \nFrom across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls, LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance. \nJOEL Have they questioned you yet, Sid? \nSIDNEY This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? \nHALLIE I have rehearsal. \nMICKEY I have to watch rehearsal. \nHallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid. \nJOEL I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid? \nSIDNEY You're not allowed to ask that. \nJOEL I'll stop by the Deltas tonight. \nSIDNEY Thanks, Joel. \nJoel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls, Lois and Murphy saunter over. \nLOIS Hello, pledges. Enjoying yourselves? \nInstantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins begrudgingly. \nHALLIE Yes, sister Lois. Very much so. Thank you for asking. \nMURPHY Good. We need your help, pledges. Are you familiar with the Deltas TP fundraiser? \nThe pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag and passes them out. \nLOIS (CONT'D) In our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause... \nMURPHY ... this week's TKE kegger... \nLOIS Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece. \nMURPHY We've set you each at a five dollar quota. \nMICKEY Come on, guys. Uncool. \nMURPHY Am I getting fraternity interference, Mickey? \nSIDNEY It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. \nDEREK Sid, you don't have to. \nSidney takes her toilet paper. \nSIDNEY No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie. \nShe throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches. \nDEREK How do you put up with this Greek shit? \nMICKEY Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie... \nACROSS THE WAY Gale moves through the crowd as the press conference/rally continues. She runs dead smack into... \nDEWEY \nTheir eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between them is revealing. \nGALE Hello, Dwight. \nDEWEY Miss Weathers. \nGALE I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... \nDEWEY I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me. \nHe tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him. \nGALE The name's Gale, remember'? \nSidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton turns to Gale. His face pained. \nCOTTON This was a mistake. I shouldn't be here. \nHe takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops filming. \nRANDY Can you say backfire? \nGALE Did you get it? \nRANDY Yeah, I got it. \nRandy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's in his voice. \nGALE You need to check your conscience at the door. We're not here to be loved. \nRandy's face reveals otherwise. \nAT THE PODIUM The sheriff continues. \nSHERIFF No, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT \nA small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place. Welcome to Sorority Row. \nINT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA huge living room. Divided sensibly in several sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl who lies on the couch watching television. This is CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She channel surfs while talking on the phone. \nCICI (on phone) No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore. \nGIRL ON PHONE (from phone) Thought he was doing AA. \nCICI No, he quit - the whole God thing - he has issues. The previews for next week... \nBEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through. \nCICI (CONT'D) Hold up... someone's calling. (she clicks over) Chi Omega House. \nMAN'S VOICE Hello. \nA MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring. \nCICI Yes. \nMAN'S VOICE Who is this? \nCICI Cici. Who's this? \nMAN'S VOICE Someone who wants to talk to you. \nCICI Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on. \nShe clicks back over. \nCICI (CONT'D) Teddy's on the other line. He sounds drunk. I'll call you back. \nGIRL ON PHONE That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. \nCICI I won't. \nGIRL ON PHONE Don't. Think Bailey. \nCICI Alright, alright... I'll call you back. \nShe clicks back over. \nCICI (CONT'D) Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's up? \nMAN'S VOICE Who's Ted? \nRealizing, it's not Ted. \nCICI Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else. \nMAN'S VOICE That's okay. \nCICI Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. \nMAN'S VOICE Where is everybody? \nCICI We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight. \nGIRL ON PHONE That's smart. \nCici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks along the sidewalk. \nCICI (calling out to him) Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0? \nThe guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat. He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within. People come and go. \nCICI (CONT'D) There's something going on at the Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down. \nCici moves further down the porch steps. The phone begins to CRACK severely. \nGIRL ON PHONE (phone begins to go out) Don't do that. Hang up... call... (static) \nCICI What? I can't hear you... \nGIRL ON PHONE (major static) Hang up... call... \nCICI I'm losing you. \nGIRL ON PHONE ... campus security... send someone... check out... place... \nCICI Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back. \nCici hangs up the phone. She hits the \"TALK\" button. Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the porch steps. \nShe tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major static. She dials 511. \nVOICE (major static) Campus Security. \nCICI Hello, I'm calling from the Chi Omega... \nVOICE (too much static) I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello? \nCici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it. \nCICA (CONT'D) Can you hear me now? \nVOICE We... bad..connec... call back. \nThe phone goes dead. \nCICI Shit. \nCici redials. The same static. \nVOICE Hello? \nCICI I'm calling... \nVOICE I can't hear you. \nCici peers through the front door, into the house. It's completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The connection becomes much clearer. \nCICI I'm calling from the Chi Omega house. Someone is harassing me. Hello? \nThere's no one on the line. \nCICI (CONT'D) Shit! \nSUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS HER. \nCici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER. \nGIRL'S VOICE Did the phone ring? \nStanding before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre- occupied. \nCICI Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here? \nDAWNIE I live here. \nCICI I thought you were going to the mixer? \nDAWNIE I had to change. Did anyone call? \nCICI Just some asshole trying to scare me. \nThe front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it. \nDAWNIE Are you okay? \nCici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from the receiver. \nCICI Hello? \nSidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up, making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie, coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate. \nA whistle BLOWS. \nMURPHY (CONT'D) Looks like we have a winner. \nSid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS. \nMURPHY (CONT'D) Sidney gets to skip the next round of Bulimia bingo. \nHallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid. \nHALLIE You bitch. \nThey crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He hurries over. \nSIDNEY Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge. \nDEREK I'm sorry honey. I got behind. \nON HALLIE AND MICKEY \nMickey is cleaning off Hallie's face. \nMICKEY I don't want you to choke or anything but you're trailing. You need to pick the pace up. \nShe swats him. \nON SID AND DEREK \nSid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round. \nSIDNEY (complete throw away) Any news? \nDEREK About what? \nSIDNEY The forbidden subject. \nHe shakes his head. \nSuddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room. \nFRAT BOY Yo, guys, outside. Something's up at the Chi Omega. Police are everywhere. \nPeople begin to stand, moving to the windows and front door. Sidney looks to Derek. \nEXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME \nEveryone comes flying out of the front door and into the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING. \nANGLE ON STREET \nTwo doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with police, ambulances, reporters... \n\"Yo - let's check it out.\" \"C'mon.\" The entire crowd takes off in droves down the street. All except for... \nSIDNEY AND DEREK \nThey stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes a circus. \nCLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE \nShe knows. \nINT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME \nCaptain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking things out. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nCaptain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered glass door. \nSHERIFF Lots of blood. But no body. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Have you checked the... \nSHERIFF Attic, garage, basement, nothing. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Take the neighborhood. \nThe Sheriff turns to his men. \nSHERIFF Alright men, listen up... \nDewey is all ears. \nCICI'S BODY \nHanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms of... \nDEWEY \nShe turns, SCREAMING. \nDEWEY It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. \nHe takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she holds on for dear life. \nEXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING \nThe early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly comes to life. \nEXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING \nThe local campus security office has been converted into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS stand guard outside while inside... \nINT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING \nThe place is packed. No longer just a campus security office. The place has been converted to the local police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS and SUITS swarm the place. \nIn a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night for all. \nCAPTAIN TYLER We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims. \nSHERIFF The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. \nDEAN FISHER Christ! Just do something. I will not have a repeat of Gainesville. Not on my campus. . \nDewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping forward. \nDEWEY Sidney Prescott, sir. \nThey both turn to him. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) She's the connection. \nCAPTAIN TYLER We know that, son. \nDEWEY The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. \nCAPTAIN TYLER We're aware of that. \nSheriff Hartley steps forward. \nDEWEY The killer is obviously repeating Woodsboro. I can fill you in on what I know. \nDewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain Tyler pulls Dewey aside. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Look, son. I know you've lived through this, but we got it under control. Why don't you have some coffee? \nJust then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The FBI and local police fawn over her. \nSHERIFF Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming in. \nGALE Of course, what can I do? \nCaptain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the back, sending him off. \nCAPTAIN TYLER We were hoping you could help with the killer's profile. \nDewey's face couldn't be more burned. \nINT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER \nA chalk board in front of them. Three names are written on it under the label \"Victims\" - \"MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR\" \nGale is at the chalk board \nGALE Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott. Sidney Prescott's mother. The first victim in the Woodsboro Murders. Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the first kid to be murdered. Ten to one - Cici is not the third victim's real name. \nSHERIFF It's Cassandra. \nGALE Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The third victim in Woodsboro. She was hung from a tree and gutted. \nThe room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the room. His eyes burning holes into Gale. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Jesus... \nGALE This is a complete copycat. Your killer is even going in sequence. \nCaptain Tyler sits up. \nJOHNNY Because she was sleeping with my dad. She's the reason my mom left. She was a whore just like you. \nIN THE THEATRE \nThese words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching. \nON SCREEN \nTORI My mom was no whore. Don't you say that. \nJOHHNY Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore! \nTori starts to cry. \nIN THE THEATRE \nTears find their way down Sidney's cheeks. \nON SCREEN \nJohnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) It's the perfect alibi, Sidney. \nSIDEKICK Just like in the movies. \nIN THE THEATRE \nSidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out of the theatre. \nINT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER \nSid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She moves into a curtained section where the water fountain is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are right behind him. \nVOICE Hello Sidney. \nSidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her. shoulders slumped, his face pained. \nSIDNEY Cotton. \nCOTTON Can we talk? \nSIDNEY I don't think that's a good idea. \nCOTTON Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings. \nSIDNEY What do you want from me, Cotton? \nCOTTON You could start with an apology. \nSIDNEY I did that. \nCOTTON You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate. \nSIDNEY How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that? \nCOTTON I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. \nA long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads. \nSIDNEY Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist. \nMore silence. \nCOTTON I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help. \nSIDNEY Did it? \nCOTTON It helped me realize one thing. \nSIDNEY What? \nCOTTON You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother. \nAnd with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm, stopping her just as... \nTHE TWO POLICE GUARDS \nAppear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's side. \nRANDY You okay? \nSid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They do a body search, pulling from his coat a large revolver. Cotton just smiles. \nCUT TO: \nRANDY What'd I miss? \nGale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular phone RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy. \nGALE I'm not here. \nRandy takes the phone. \nRANDY Hello? \nMAN'S VOICE Gale? \nRANDY She's not here right now. \nMAN'S VOICE But she's standing right next to you. \nShit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He points around campus, mouthing \"He's watching.\" Gale grabs Dewey. \nGALE C'mon. (to Randy) Keep him talking. \nGale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where STUDENTS come and go. \nON RANDY \nHe holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say? \nRANDY So... what's your favorite scary movie? No response. Silence. \nMAN'S VOICE They'll never find me. \nRandy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students, searching. \nRANDY What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up? \nMAN'S VOICE What's your favorite scary movie? \nRANDY SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close? \nMAN'S VOICE Closer than you think. \nON DEWEY AND GALE \nThey move through passing STUDENTS. \nGALE He has to be nearby. He likes the game. \nDewey is on the his walkie. \"I need back-up.\" He has a hard time keeping up with Gale. He hobbles along. \nBACK ON RANDY \nHe goes on a tirade pacing back and forth. \nRANDY So what's your deal? Can we talk openly for a second? How does one become a serial killer? Huh? Are you psychopathic or merely psychotic? And what is the distinguishing feature'? Were you slapped around as a child? Is it hereditary? Did your Mom take test drugs? You know, have you tried getting laid? It's done wonders for my homicidal tendencies. \nMAN'S VOICE Do you want to die? \nRANDY Gee, let me think. \"Do you want to... \" Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add. \nON GALE AND DEWEY \nGale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS. He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to pounce on her. \nDewey appears. \nDEWEY It's okay. C'mon, Gale. \nBACK ON RANDY \nRandy won't let up. He continues dissing. \nRANDY And if you're such a brilliant smart killer - why copycat? Why not be original? Where's the innovation? Let's pioneer some new ground. Make a statement. Go down in history. Now you'll always be the Woodsboro copycat killer. That's lame. It's like a bad sequel. And why Woodsboro? What about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam? Why imitate two high school loser- ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys. Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking homo-repressed, mama's boy. \nSuddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, a GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck. The move is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is wrenched back into the newsvan. The door SLAMS shut. \nON DEWEY AND GALE \nAs they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in the distant. Gale races up to find Randy nowhere. \nGALE Randy? Randy? Where did he go? \nDewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side door. She tears it open as... \nRANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat slit. \nGale's SCREAM is heard all over campus. \nCOTTON Yeah, that's it. \nSHERIFF Why did you attack Sidney Prescott? \nCOTTON There was no attack, we were talking. Very heatedly. Miss Prescott and I have a very complicated past. That's no crime. \nCAPTAIN TYLER And the gun? \nCOTTON I have a permit. It's registered. I have a legal right to carry it. \nSHERIFF Why do you need a gun? \nCOTTON Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here. I've been down this road before. And unless you're going to charge me with a crime I'd like to walk outta here. I have an interview at \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - OUTER OFFICE \nGale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss. \nGALE Where's Sidney'? \nDEWEY She's safe. \nSilence. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) How you doin? \nGALE Not good. How you doin? \nDEWEY Not good. \nJust then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves to him. \nDEWEY Can't we hold him? \nCAPTAIN TYLER No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move. \nDEWEY What now? \nON COTTON \nHe stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches. \nGALE What's going on, Cotton? \nCOTTON You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive? \nGALE Did you do it? \nShe looks him dead in the eyes. \nCOTTON Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you? \nGALE You have a right to be angry. \nCOTTON No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that. \nGALE Cotton, I've done nothing but help you. \nCOTTON You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights? \nJust then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun. \nGALE Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far. \nCOTTON Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes. \nCotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins Dewey and the others. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Night's coming. I think its time to beef up security on the Prescott girl. \nGALE Where is she? \nSHERIFF She was just escorted to her dorm room. \nDEWEY Is she safe there? \nCAPTAIN TYLER We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark. \nDEWEY That doesn't work, sir. \nGALE You're just isolating people. You're giving the killer a blank canvas. \nCUT TO: \nFRATERNITY JOCK Who do you love? \nMICKEY Hallie. \nFRATERNITY JOCK Did you say \"My TKE brothers\"? \nMICKEY No, I said Hallie. \nMore food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The crowd goes crazy. \nINT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nHallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it together. \nSIDNEY I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break. \nHALLIE It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to. \nSIDNEY I'd really just like to be alone. \nDEWEY The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe. \nSIDNEY Dewey, there's no such place. \nDEWEY Humor me, Sid. \nSidney starts packing an overnight bag. \nHALLIE Can I come with her? \nSIDNEY No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. \nGALE Sid, I'll come with you. \nSIDNEY But who would operate your camera? \nA burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard standing with Joel. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) He's cool, Remy. \nJoel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid. \nJOEL They got Mickey. He's being toasted at the Deltas. \nHALLIE I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over there. \nJOEL We're under quarantine. \nHe points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway. \nHALLIE I'm the only one who can cut him down. \nSIDNEY It's not a good idea, Hallie. \nJOEL I'll go with her. \nHALLIE Be safe, girl. \nShe gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his head in. \nDEWEY Sid, you should get going. \nHe looks at Joel and Hallie. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) Where are you two headed? \nJOEL (instant cover) Hallie forgot her footage at the film dept. I'm gonna walk her over before it's gets too late \nDEWEY You really... \nHALLIE I gotta have it, Dewey. \nGale steps in. \nGALE Hey, Dewey? \nHALLIE Seeya, Dewey. \nHallie and Joel race outta there before any more objections. Dewey turns to Gale. \nGALE If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could? \nDEWEY Meaning? \nGALE He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek? \nPOLICE GUARD #2 We're meeting another car that will transport you the rest of the way. \nPOLICE GUARD #1 Safety precautions. \nSIDNEY I feel like Eddie Murphy. \nThe car comes to a halt in front of a stop light. \nPOLICE GUARD #1 We feel like Kevin Costner. \nSidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but it's cut short. \nSid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too late. The Ghost has the door open. \nA flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is slit. \nIN THE BACK SEAT \nSidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal. \nIN THE FRONT SEAT \nThe Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road. \nSidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic, and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use. \nEXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME \nThe car makes its way down the deserted street \nIN THE BACKSEAT \nSidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape. Through the window, she sees approaching headlights. She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes by. \nSidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road. \nShe eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed. \nSidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck is right up against it. \nSid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, ready to attack. \nWithout pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for a moment. \nThe car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building. The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post that stands directly in the car's path. \nThe Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT, lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior. \nSmoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nAll is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out. \nSid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the car. It's flush against the building. \nThen she notices the metal grate. The edge has been pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards... \nCREAK! \nSid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the... \nFRONT SEAT \nSid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move. \nThe only way out is through the driver's door. \nAfter what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement. Nothing. \nShe slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass through. \nShe sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob. \nHONK! \nHer back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops. \nShe looks to the Ghost. \nCLOSE ON HER FACE \nAs she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away when... \nTHE GHOST COMES TO LIFE \nGALE No, Dewey, let's call for backup. \nBut Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP. \nON THE UPPER LEVEL \nDewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge. He approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light. \nHe reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod. It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare. \nDewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks up to him. \nGALE Dewey? \nDEWEY There's nothing. I'm coming down. \nDewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained. She takes a step forward, moving out of frame, revealing \nTHE GHOST \nWho stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see the Ghost standing directly behind Gale. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) Watch out! \nDOWN BELOW \nGale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults, just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle of seats. \nUP ABOVE \nDewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his handicapped leg will allow. \nDOWN BELOW \nGale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind her. \nAT THE LECTURN \nDewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale. \nDEWEY (CONT'D) Gale! \nHe eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for it. \nINT. CORRIDOR - SAME \nGale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door. She tears it open, disappearing into... \nINT. SOUND STAGE - SAME \nGale finds herself in the student studios. She stands in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage. Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality. \nGale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room. Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are heard, making their way towards her. \nGale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the... \nGHOST FIGURE \nThat stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS. She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the control booth. She's protected by a clear, large, plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying to secure it. There's no lock. \nAT THE MAIN DOOR \nDewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he immediately spots Gale. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nGale looks for objects to block the door with. She drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door. \nOUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nDewey moves to the window. \nDEWEY Gale! Gale! \nShe doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM \nGale shoves everything she can find against the door, not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the sound proof barrier behind her. \nShe also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused. \nINSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE \nGale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is splattered against the glass. \nSIDNEY I'll be right back. \nMICKEY Where you going? \nSidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage. Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid settles on a shovel. \nSid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him. \nSIDNEY Watch out. \nSid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact. \nMICKEY Do it again. \nCLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around peering into the night. \nMICKEY (CONT'D) What was that? \nSIDNEY Don't panic. \nSidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening it. \nMickey pulls on it. It won't quite give. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Watch out. \nSid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid. \nMickey looks up, just in time. \nMICKEY SIDNEYWATCHOUT! \nSid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready. Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying. \nMickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls, twists, squirms... anything to free himself. \nThe Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this. \nSIDNEY Hey. \nSidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting across the yard, running smack into... \nTHE GHOST MASKED KILLER \nBut Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but they counter, keeping her surrounded. \nSid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife. She turns to the other. His knife is already poised. They close in on her, ready to strike. \nShe looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM! \nSuddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass. \nMICKEY Run, Sid... \nSidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards the front of the yard. \nMickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him. He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him. \nSidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops... she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around just in time to see... \nMickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're knives strike at the same time. One through the stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the ground. \nBoth Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off running, along the side of the house, through a row of shrub that take her to... \nEXT. STREET - SAME \nSid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of it. \nShe spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up. KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night. \nShe turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie. \nSIDNEY Hallie? \nBut Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER \nGale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She goes for it. \nGale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL button. \nVOICE (from phone) What is your emergency please? \nTHE CURTAIN DROPS \nGale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the curtain separates them. \nON STAGE \nDerek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her throat. \nHALLIE It's about time she showed up. \nIN THE AUDITORIUM \nGale moves to the exit door and into the... \nINT. STAIR WELL SAME \nGale eyes a door that's marked \"STAGE DOOR\". She opens it and steps in coming face to face with a... \nA LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER \nGale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find... \nDEBBIE SALT standing, lips pursed. \nDEBBIE SALT Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for you. \nGale's face is a mass of confusion. \nINT. STAGE SAME \nDerek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her knees, next to Cotton. \nCLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND \nSIDNEY Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live. \nHALLIE Not this time. \nHallie moves in on her. \nDEREK Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood. I'm really getting tired of all the happy endings. It's just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth. \nSIDNEY But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that. \nHALLIE Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious. \nSIDNEY You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos... \nVOICE (off camera) Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies don't create pyschos. \nSid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He doesn't want to miss a second. \nDEBBIE SALT Don't you know that by now? It's about family. It all starts at home. It starts with the father... and the mother. \nSidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately. \nSIDNEY Mrs. Loomis? \nGale stops cold. \nGALE What? \nSIDNEY Oh my God. \nGale turns to Debbie Salt. \nGALE Jesus. It can't be. \nHALLIE Told you we had a guest star. Didn't see that coming, did you? \nDEREK Everything's taken on a hyper- reality, hasn't it? \nGALE You're Billy's mother? \nDEBBIE SALT I couldn't believe you didn't recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book. \nGALE You're all in this together? \nDEREK We had to have financing. \nHALLIE Tuition's expensive. \nSIDNEY Why Mrs. Loomis? \nDEBBIE SALT Where should we start? Your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband. You ruined my family by killing my son. Gale aired it to the world. Should I go on... isn't that enough? \n", "test1_input": "DEREK It's under control. \nHe kisses her again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDENT UNION - LATER \nA huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place. \nGale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not fast enough. \nDEBBIE SALT Hi, Gale, any leads? \nGALE Tons and tons. \nDEBBIE SALT Where is Sidney's father? \nGALE Home - where he lives. \nDEBBIE SALT And are the police sure about that? \nGALE Why don't you ask them? \nDEBBIE SALT Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think? \nGALE No, I don't. \nDEBBIE SALT Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home. \nGALE Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me. \nGale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack. \nGale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket. \nGALE (CONT'D) Hello? \nMAN'S VOICE Hello, Gale. \nIt's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable. \nGALE Who is this? \nMAN'S VOICE I'll give you one guess. \nGale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A CAMPUS COP is across the lobby. \nGALE Who are you? \nMAN'S VOICE That's not the way we play the game. \nGALE I don't play games. \nMAN'S VOICE What if your life depended on it? \nGale gets testy with him. \nGALE What do you want? \nMAN'S VOICE You're pretty when you're angry. \nGale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive with people. He could be anywhere. \nGALE Where are you? \nMAN'S VOICE I'm everywhere. \nShe continues moving to the Campus Cop. \nGALE Oh - a God complex \nMAN'S VOICE Stay away from the cop. \nA deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over a balcony. \nGALE What do you want from me? \nMAN'S VOICE It's what you want from me. \nSilence. \nGALE What do you mean? \nMAN'S VOICE You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over. \n", "test1_true": "MAN'S VOICE No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon. \nGALE No, wait... \nMAN'S VOICE Watch your back. \nCLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She turns and heads off, right into... \nDEWEY \nThey both GASP. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAMPUS THEATRE - DAY \nA large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but preserved and updated. A rehearsal is in progress. SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running lines as stagehands work on the set around them. \nSidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very animated. More alive than ever. She dons a Russian accent. Convincing. A promising actress. \nSIDNEY (in character) \"Pain, yah, such pain. Pain.\" \nAn awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other. Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up. \nLOIS That's not the line. You jumped. \nSIDNEY Shit. Did I? \nLOIS About a page. \nDIRECTOR (off stage) CUT! Let's take five. \nThe actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie sits watching. Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting scattered about. \nHALLIE That was good. \nSIDNEY Yeah, right. \nThe DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly. \nDIRECTOR Sid, why don't you get outta here? We'll pick this up tomorrow. \nSid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her. \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) Work on the accent. \nShe grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when... \nVOICE Sid? \nSid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had been watching rehearsal. Sid's face tenses. \nHALLIE Who is that guy? \nSIDNEY It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. \nHALLIE No, girletta, I don't leave your side. \nSIDNEY I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. \nSid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the aisle, against her better wishes. \nSIDNEY What do you want? \nRANDY I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me. \nSIDNEY Do you work for her now? \nRANDY Well, yeah... she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. \nSidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing. \nSIDNEY Me, too. Randy. Me too. \nHe nods, knowingly. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Wanna get outta here? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - AFTERNOON \nGale and Dewey are with Captain Tyler and Sheriff Evans. \n", "test2_input": "CAPTAIN TYLER If he calls again - find help. Don't engage him in conversation. I'm gonna put a man on you - to cover you. \nDEWEY I can do it, Captain. \nCAPTAIN TYLER Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off... \nGALE I'd prefer Dewey, Captain. \nTyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids Gale's stare. \nDEWEY How's the name search going? \nCAPTAIN TYLER 37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER \nA movie is in progress. STAB. \nON SCREEN \nA young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs down a school corridor. She runs smack into a young, handsome boy. He could very well be Johnny Depp. \nTORI (in movie) Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What are you doing here? \nJOHNNY (in movie) They let me go, Sid, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. \nIN THE THEATRE \nSid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type theatre. Behind them sit Sid's trusting police guards. Sidney shifts in her seat. \nRANDY You okay, Sid? \nSIDNEY Yeah. \nON SCREEN \nTori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic discussion. \nJOHNNY When my mom left my dad, I accepted it. That's just the way the cookie crumbles. Moms leave. \nTORI Yeah, but your mom left town. She's not dead. My mom's dead. Do you hear me? She's dead. Dead. And she's never coming back. Ever, Ever. \nIN THE THEATRE \nSidney grows increasingly uneasy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDENT CAFETERIA - LATER \nMickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in the Student Union Cafeteria. \nDEREK My documentary is due on Tuesday. \nMICKEY What's your subject? \nDEREK I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. \nJOEL You should of done it on Sidney. That would have been a cool. \nDEREK She wouldn't let me. \nMICKEY Not with Primetime Live and 20/20 coming at her. I'd save my shit too. \nHallie comes waltzing up. \nDEREK Where's Sid? \nHALLIE Damned if I know. She ditched me. \nDEREK You weren't supposed to leave her alone. \nHALLIE I didn't say she was alone. That guy - from her home town showed up. They went off together. \nHallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss. \nMICKEY I've been waiting for you, baby. \nJOEL Is that cool? Just to leave her like that? \nHALLIE She's got guards with her. \nDEREK What guy? \n", "test2_true": "JOEL Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro. \nMICKEY Her old boyfriend? \nJOEL No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. \nMICKEY Watch out, Derek. \nHALLIE He tried to kill her first. \nMICKEY Is Sid in therapy? \nJOEL She was for a while. Gave it up. \nDEREK How do you know so much about her? \nJOEL I read the book. \nMICKEY I could use some therapy. \nDEREK Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying? \nHALLIE He seemed harmless. \nDEREK Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless? \nJOEL And white. \nMICKEY Easy black boy. \nJOEL It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive - slightly off white males in their twenties. \nHALLIE That's you, honey. \nHallie kisses Mickey again. \nMICKEY I got a surprise for you. \nHALLIE What? \nSuddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins to sing at the top of his lungs. \nMICKEY \"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way... \nHALLIE Don't do this. \nMICKEY \"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you.\" \nEveryone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing with him. \nJOEL (to Derek) Whitney? \nDEREK I think he's doing Dolly. \nMICKEY \"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY.\" \nDEREK Definitely Whitney. \nHallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up, ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her. \nJOEL Isn't that a big no-no? \nDEREK I think so. \nHallie breaks away. She swats him. \nHALLIE You're going to get it. You know what happens. \nMICKEY But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it. \nHallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER \nSid and Randy continue watching the movie. The guards behind them are way engrossed. \nON SCREEN \nIt's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen. Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face. \nTORI Why did you kill my mother? \n", "test3_input": "DEREK Smile for the camera. \nSidney remains silent. \nCOTTON Sid, c'mon. \nSide backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either one of them. Derek watches her, amused. \nDEREK Go on, untie him. \nSIDNEY No. This is a set up. \nDEREK That's quick. \nCOTTON Please, Sidney, he's going to kill us. \nDerek begins filming again. \nDEREK You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now. \nSidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie hangs. \nDEREK (CONT'D) Sidney, you can't keep your back to the audience like that. Could you cheat a little forward for me? \nCOTTON Please, Sidney. \nDEREK You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn. Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm? \nSuddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much alive. \nHALLIE Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The story of your life, Sid. \nSidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself down from the wall with a big hunting knife. \nDEREK Need some help, honey. \nHALLIE I got it.. \nSidney's eyes go back and forth between the two. \nDEREK You should really see your face right now, Sid. It's doing some freaky shit. \nDerek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured. \nHALLIE Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. \nDEREK Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life? \nSidney stares them down. She's been here before. \nSIDNEY Why? \nDEREK Good question. You took the bait. \nHALLIE Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. \nDEREK I really don't like that comparison, honey. \nHALLIE (to Sid) He hates Oliver Stone. \nDEREK I find his work overwrought. \nSid is waning. \nHALLIE C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've been planning this baby for a year. Humor us. \nSid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to untie him. \nDEREK Nope. You had your chance. \nDerek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THEATRE SAME \nGale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it. It's locked. \nGALE Shit. \nShe moves down along the theatre to another door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER \n", "test3_true": "DEREK We met on the internet. \nHALLIE He sent me the cutest e-mail. \nDEREK I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line... \nHALLIE We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you. \nDEREK You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented. \nHALLIE You're the one who got away. \nDEREK Until now. \nCOTTON You guys are fucked. \nHALLIE Actually Cotton, and I think critics would agree, it's the other way around. \nDEREK Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel? \nSIDNEY You're not going to get away with this. \nHALLIE Of course not. Who wants to? What's the point if we don't get caught? Where's the glamour in that? \nDEREK The way I see it. We'll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II. \nHALLIE A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it. \nDEREK We're hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned. \nHALLIE And now, drum roll please... \nDEREK Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you. \nCotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing them. \nHALLIE A twist ending if you will. \nDEREK Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing's been done. \nHALLIE ... so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... \nDEREK And we didn't want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money's worth. \nHALLIE So we found a compromise. \nDEREK Or it found us. \nHALLIE We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings. \nDEREK Just for you, Sid. \nHALLIE Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip. \nDerek reaches in his pocket for a coin. \nDEREK Oh yeah. (to Sid) We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It's been an ongoing discussion. (to Hallie) Heads or tails? \nHALLIE Tails. \nHe flips the coin. \nDEREK Shit! You win. \nIN THE AUDITORIUM \nGale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle. \nGALE Sidney! \nON STAGE \nThey all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy to see her. \nSIDNEY Gale! \nIN THE AUDITORIUM \nGale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on. \nON STAGE \nSidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as... \n"}

Trees quiver around them.  Shadows dance.  Bizzlebek pauses at a particular grave, apart from the others, more hidden by overgrowth.  He runs his fingertips over the old, strangely lettered inscription.  He looks around the graveyard, making sure they're alone, then he moves to one side of the stone and leans his weight against it, pushing.  It shifts and slides open, uncovering the hole that lies beneath. 
BIZZLEBEK I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this. 
KAFKA (unclear) An empty tomb? 
BIZZLEBEK A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look -- 
Having lit the lantern he's brought with him, he holds it over the dark hole -- revealing a shaft and the rungs of a ladder. 
BIZZLEBEK The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route. (offers Kafka the lantern) Don't get stuck. 
KAFKA (accepts it) Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know. 
THE SHAFT 
Kafka starts to climb down, shoes loud on the rungs affixed to the stone wall of this well.  But then he remembers something, pops back up. 
KAFKA -- You appreciate my writing. 
BIZZLEBEK (taken aback) Yes. 
KAFKA Will you do me a favor then? 
BIZZLEBEK Another one? 
KAFKA If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please. 
BIZZLEBEK What an extraordinary request! 
KAFKA It's my last and final one. 
BIZZLEBEK Then its authority is in doubt. 
KAFKA A true friend would do it. 
BIZZLEBEK Not necessarily. (a pointed look) A wife would. 
CUT: 
SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
A stooping Kafka makes his way along this gloomy underground artery, the lantern lighting the way. 
He comes to the end of it and what appears to be a little door.  He bends low to listen at it -- then unlocks the latch.  He pushes -- and the door moves forward. 
OTHER SIDE 
Kafka stands up -- and he's inside a big filing cabinet drawer. 
He steps out of it and looks around.  He's in an entire room full of file cabinet drawers.  A morgue of file cabinet drawers.  He shuts the one he came out of before walking away.  "D-7" says the label on the outside of it. 
CUT: 
VAULTS AND CRYPTS 
Kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the underground depths of the Castle.  A fiery glow and noise comes from an archway ahead of him.  When he gets to it and looks through he sees a sweating STOKER shoveling coal into a giant furnace. 
CUT: 
NEAR THE END OF A THIN PASSAGEWAY 
A sudden door SLAM.  Kafka dodges back around a corner.  He HEARS:  the quick cry of a man's agony, a scuffle of shoes on hard stone floor, a dull thud, a wave of peculiar shouts, running footsteps, more mumbled mingled voices -- which soon die out, leaving silence. 
AROUND THE CORNER 
Kafka walks slowly, straining his neck a bit in expectation of whatever lies ahead. 
The passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells.  A line of doors with a barred window in each.  One of them isn't closed -- and lying across the threshold is the Laborer who chased Kafka from the quarries the other night.  The knife is gone from his sheath and his scull is caved in, a wooden stool lying on the floor beside him.  At the other end of the row of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps.

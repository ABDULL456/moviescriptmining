EXT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light. Realizes with a sudden shock:   something's wrong. HALLENBECK That's not L.A.P.D.... 
HALLENBECK'S POV 
the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE PATROL. In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo is in the driver's seat. 
WIDER ANGLE Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe. HALLENBECK Son of a bitch! He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as: 
INT. OFFICE - SAME Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked.    Terrified. Darian comes awake, screaming: DARIAN Mommy, what's happening? Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and meanwhile -- 
EXT. OFFICE - SAME Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters. 
MILO advances. changing clips.    Methodical.   Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed.    All vestige of sanity gone. MILO You fucked up my face, Joseph! Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard. MILO Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face. He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard. 
HALLENBECK huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three. 
DOWN BELOW Milo calmly changes clips. Hallenbeck bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He's trying to make the freeway. It's a good fifteen feet.   Try it sometime. He flies through open air -- Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out -- And just does make it. Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up -- 
EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK 
is headed straight for him, bearing down...! He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past. Staggers to his feet, frantic -- and Milo is climbing the billboard. Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide. There isn't any. He's going to have to run through traffic. He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening, and meanwhile -- 
INT. SUBARU - DRIVING Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.

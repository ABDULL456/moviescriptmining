SCRAGGY He say if he could... He would go back! 
Tyki OFFERS some more information to Scraggy. Scraggy TRANSLATES. 
SCRAGGY He say "Pai Cho" may help you. 
Indiana's eyes WIDEN. STARTLED. AMAZED. Clare LOOKS at Indy. PUZZLED. 
CLARE "Pai Cho"? 
INDIANA The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of Sun Wu Kung. (anxious, looking at Scraggy) His disciples always carry the Pai Cho with them... 
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy NODS and REMOVES his belt. We see that the thick belt actually unravels into a CLOTH SCROLL. Tyki KISSES the scroll and GIVES it to Scraggy. Scraggy nervously OPENS the scroll. It is filled with countless ANCIENT CHINESE WRITINGS and PROVERBS. Indiana STARES over Scraggy's shoulder. 
INDIANA Can you translate it?... 
Scraggy NODS. Indiana's eyes ANXIOUSLY scan the document. He is BREATHLESS. EXCITED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. 
Suddenly, BETSY AND THE CHIMPANZEE FALL INTO FRAME! ON TOP OF THE SCROLL! Bonzo STRADDLES Betsy, trying to move his lips TOWARD hers! She is SCREAMING! 
BETSY Get...him...off...of...me...! 
Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES the kiss from her lips. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP: A FLASHING NEON SIGN. 
It reads: "DASHIELL'S AMERICAN BAR". It adorns the front of a stylish, Mozambique NIGHTCLUB. 
INT. DASHIELL'S BAR 
DIMLY lit. SMOKY. Filled with cloth covered TABLES and ornamental, AFRICAN furnishings. A 9 piece JAZZ BAND plays SWING TUNES. A few couples SWAY on the dance floor. The place is swarming with NAZIS. Many are SEATED at the bar. Others are scattered at various TABLES throughout the restaurant. Some stand in CORNERS. Lurking in the SHADOWS. They are all looking in one direction, watching one man... INDIANA JONES. 
Indy sits with Scraggy, Clare and Betsy, at a table near the REAR of the restaurant. They are eating DINNER. But Indy, Scraggy and Clare are more interested in the Stone Monkey SCROLLS. A very NERVOUS Scraggy TRANSLATES. Indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and pages of NOTES. Searching for a CLUE. An INTERESTED Clare reads over Indiana's shoulder. Betsy tries to become INCLUDED in the discussion. But everyone IGNORES her. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE. 
SCRAGGY "Sun Wu Kung run like fire, He journey to Many Monkey Land, To build his final empire." 
BETSY Who's Sun Wu-Kung? 
INDIANA (ignoring Betsy, to Scraggy) Many Monkey Land... That's a definite reference to Africa. 
BETSY Africa?... He journeyed to Africa?... 
CLARE (also ignores Betsy, to Indiana) That confirms our suspicions that he may have formed his Civilization here... 
BETSY What civilization? 
INDIANA (angry, to Betsy) Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This doesn't concern you. 
BETSY (insulted) Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub. We should be havin' fun. (grabs Indiana's hand) C'mon, Indy. Let's dance. 
INDIANA Later. 
BETSY What a buncha' stiffs! (condescending, to Clare) Bet you can't dance. 
CLARE Quite the contrary...I spent several months studying dance. 
BETSY Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?... The Bunny Hop?... The Jitterbug?... 
CLARE (shakes her head) The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The Dungumaro. 
BETSY Huh? 
CLARE African Tribal dances. 
BETSY Never heard of 'em. 
CLARE Of course not. They're beyond the spectrum of your microscopic world. 
Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls. 
UNDER THE TABLE 
Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers. 
INDIANA 
GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.

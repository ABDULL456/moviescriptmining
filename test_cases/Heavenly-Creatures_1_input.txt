PAULINE You're such an incredible woman. 
JULIET I couldn't have done it without you, Charles. 
INT. SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - DAY"THE ROLE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TODAY" - written on the blackboard. Mrs. STEVE ns is presiding over Form 4A. 
Juliet is standing at the front of the class, reading from an essay. 
JULIET . . . the Empress Deborah has the difficulty fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning, noon and night . . . 
The class titters . . . they clearly want to I STEVE ns s glare deters them. 
Pauline sits at the back, smirking. 
MRS. STEVE NS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet! 
JULIET . . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . . 
MRS. STEVE NS That's enough, Juliet! 
Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. STEVE ns rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose. 
MRS. STEVE NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke? 
JULIET No, Mrs. STEVE ns. 
MRS. STEVE NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish! 
Pauline leaps to her feet. 
PAULINE It's not rubbish! 
MRS. STEVE NS Sit down, Pauline! 
JULIET I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested. 
Pauline points at the blackboard. 
PAULINE It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors! 
MRS. STEVE NS (Yelling) Sit down! 
Pauline sits down, looking victorious. 
MRS. STEVE NS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat! 
Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE ns's face darkens. 
MRS. STEVE NS Stop it, Juliet! 
Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts, trying not to laugh. 
Juliet slumps over her desk, coughing . . . globules of blood splatter her exercise book. 
Pauline's smile vanishes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTPauline is standing in the hallway, holding the phone to her ear. She slowly lowers it, her face shocked. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) Mrs. Hulme told me they had found out today that Juliet has tuberculosis on one lung. Poor Julietta. I nearly fainted when I heard. I had a terrible job not to cry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT - MORNINGPauline is lying in her bed looking depressed. She writes her diary. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too. 
HONORA comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast. 
HONORA Come on, sit up. 
PAULINE I'm not hungry. 
HONORA You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill. 
PAULINE I just want to be on my own for a while. 
HONORA starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline. 
HONORA You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

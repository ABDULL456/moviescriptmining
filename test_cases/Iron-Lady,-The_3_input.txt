MARGARET sips a whisky. 
MARGARET (V.O.) I offer my resignation after eleven and a half extraordinary years - 
INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY. 
MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine, her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in tears. 
MARGARET -proud to have left Britain in a much better state than when we took office. 
She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops to receive a gift, opening it- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) What's this then? A radio... How useful. 
She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She is crying. 
Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing herself. Denis's hand on her shoulder standing behind. 
DENIS Steady, MT. 
MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door handle. As it swings open- 
INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT 
MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror. 
DENIS (O.S.) The greatest Prime Minister since Churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies! 
MARGARET VO All those years of taking the tough decisions, does any of it matter now? 
DENIS It's all been turned to mush! 
MARGARET What? 
DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper. 
DENIS By these fools! These lily-livered pinkos! 
MARGARET These inept placators. 
DENIS Very good! These vacillators. 
MARGARET Vacillators! Poll takers. 
DENIS Popularity seekers. 
MARGARET So busy taking the pulse of the public! 
DENIS Weak - 
MARGARET (pulling down a rack of Denis's black oxford shoes onto the floor) These...weak...weak...weak...wea.. .weak...Men! 
DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are several bin liners already filled with clothes. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Don't they know if you take the tough decisions, yes people will hate you today but they'll thank you for generations. 
DENIS Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish! 
MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last big chest of drawers. 
MARGARET V/O (seizing shirts and jerseys and putting them on the floor) All I wanted was to make a difference in the world.

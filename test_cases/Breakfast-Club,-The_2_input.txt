BRIAN Andy...you wanna get in on this? Allison here says, she wants to run away, because her home life is unsatisfying... 
ANDREW Well everyone's home lives are un- satisfying...If it wasn't, people would live with there parents forever... 
BRIAN Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I think that her's goes beyond, you know, what guys like you and me... consider normal unsatisfying... 
ALLISON Nevermind...forget it, everything's cool! 
Allison starts putting everything back in her purse. 
ANDREW What's the deal? 
ALLISON No!  There's no deal, Sporto. Forget it, leave me alone. 
ANDREW Wait a minute, now you're carrying all that crap around in your purse. Either you really wanna run away or you want people to think you wanna run away. 
ALLISON Eat shit! 
Allison gets up and walks away. 
BRIAN The girl is an island, with herself. Okay? 
Andrew gets up and goes after her. 
ANDREW Hi, you wanna talk? 
ALLISON No! 
ANDREW Why not? 
ALLISON Go away... 
ANDREW Where do you want me to go? 
ALLISON GO away! 
Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry. 
ALLISON You have problems... 
ANDREW Oh, I have problems? 
ALLISON You do everything everybody ever tells you to do, that is a problem! 
ANDREW Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems...Did I? So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is is bad?  Real bad?  Parents? 
Allison is silently crying. 
ALLISON Yeah... 
Andrew nods. 
ANDREW What do they do to you?

They both are crying silently. CUT TO:

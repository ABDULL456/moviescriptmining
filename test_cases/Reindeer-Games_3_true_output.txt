Rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and Coke into his own face -- 
RUDY Heyyyy! 
Reaching Ashley, his goatee is dripping -- 
ASHLEY Nick, what happened -- 
RUDY There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing -- (hands her his glass) -- drink this for me. 
He hustles for the bathroom. A moment later, Jumpy storms by. 
Stops at Ashley. 
JUMPY What happened? 
ASHLEY He started losing his hair. 
INT. CASINO BATHROOM - DAY 
The College Kid is zipping up when Rudy SLAMS into his back, money in hand, crashing him against the wall: 
RUDY Hundred bucks to wear this jacket -- 
COLLEGE KID Jesus, man, don't kill me! 
RUDY Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's giving you a rhinestone jacket and a hundred bucks. 
INT. TOMAHAWK SAME 
Merlin's at a slot machine, watching the hall to the bathrooms. A WAITRESS arrives, hands him a beer: 
MERLIN Thanks, sister. How are ya. 
WAITRESS Fuckin' freezing. 
MERLIN Hell yeah. You work here long? 
WAITRESS Five years. Since it opened. 
MERLIN How long ago was your makeover? 
WAITRESS My what?! 
MERLIN No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around. 
The waitress frowns. 
WAITRESS The Tomahawk's looked the same since I started, mister. (shrugs) Only the losers change. 
Merlin stares at her. Then drops his drink to the floor, charging for the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
As Merlin crashes in, seeing the cowboy hat and jacket, back turned, adjusting a belt. As the figure turns around. 
It's the College Kid. Merlin stops in his tracks -- 
-- as Rudy CRASHES into him from a stall, kicking his legs out, driving his throat into a countertop. Merlin hits the ground, gagging. Rudy wears the kid's sweatshirt: 
RUDY GO! GO! 
The College Kid, shaking, hustles out the door. 
INT. TOMAHAWK - CONTINUOUS 
As the College Kid, in Rudy's black getup, strides out of the bathroom hall, walking for the casino exit. 
From the slots, Ashley and Jumpy glance up, seeing him go. From their vantage, it looks like Rudy. They frown. 
As they're watching the Kid hit the door, Rudy darts out of the hall, heads the other way. 
EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA 
Gabriel and Pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave the casino. wandering into-the parking lot... away from them. 
GABRIEL Where the hell's he going? 
PUG Where the hell's your sister? 
As the figure unlocks the driver's door of a Trans Am -- 
GABRIEL Get him! 
Pug REVS the engine, speeds through the lot, cutting off the Trans Am from backing away. 
Gabriel jumps out, HAULS the cowboy from his car and sees it's the College Kid. Rudy's gone. 
COLLEGE KID (scared shitless) Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it... 
INT. TOMAHAWK 
Merlin stumbles out of the bathroom, holding his throat. Catches Jumpy and Ashley's eyes from the slots: 
JUMPY Trouble. 
INT. CASINO KITCHEN 
As Rudy charges toward COOKS, holding a buffet plate aloft --

She stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen. After a moment, Helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the dining area. She looks through the dark living room to the gray silhouette of Julie standing by the living room window, her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight. 
HELEN Are you all right, Julie? 
JULIE (muttering) I'm all right. I'm all right. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INTERIOR. BACHELOR'S APARTMENT (45 MINUTES LATER) We are looking back up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this apartment. The room is absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer. In this shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden glare. They have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their ties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO THE FLOOR to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an opened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of cigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair. Over this we hear Walter's voice: 
WALTER Is that the last one? 
EDDIE Yeah. 
A thick silence fills the room. There is a kind of sodden feeling to this scene. After a long moment, Walter's voice again: 
WALTER Ah, you've seen one, you've seen them all. 
KENNETH Yeah, they're all alike. 
CHARLIE I don't know -- I think the first one was all right. 
WALTER Yeah, I was so bored by the rest of them. I nearly fell asleep during the last one. 
KENNETH You in the habit of sleeping with your eyes open? 
We look down on the room now, at all five of the men, Eddie rewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector humming. The others loll about, their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas. There is a heavy, dense mood that no one seems willing to break. 
CHARLIE What time's it about, anybody know? 
ARNOLD (glancing at his watch) I got a quarter to nine. 
EDDIE No, it's later than that, about a quarter after. 
Again the silence falls upon the five men. Only the humming little motor interrupts the thick silence. Nobody moves. 
WALTER (after a moment) Ah, you see one, you've seen them all. 
Again the silence. Charlie stretches over for his bottle of beer on the floor beside his chair. He pours what's left of the bottle into the glass standing beside it. Otherwise nobody moves. 
WALTER (after a moment) So that's the last one you've got to show us, Eddie? 
EDDIE Yeah. You want to run them backwards? 
KENNETH I wonder where they get the girls to make these movies? 
WALTER Might as well go home, I guess. 
KENNETH Yeah. 
The idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive movement. Walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches out his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath. 
ELIJAH Hello. 
DAVID'S VOICE Elijah? 
Beat. 
ELIJAH David? 
Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND. 
DAVID'S VOICE What am I supposed to do? 
Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT 
The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling. 
ELIJAH(v.o.) David, it's okay to be afraid. Because this part won't be like a comic book... Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it. 
David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. 
ELIJAH(v.o.) Go to where people are... You won't have to look very long. 
David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them. 
He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier to heaven. 
David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as they move. 
FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE. 
SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving. 
David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side. 
David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either side of him. 
David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side. His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by. 
Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt and slicked back hair brushes by... 
FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER. 
SLICKED HAIR MAN Go back to Africa! 
THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth. He watches him for a beat. 
FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS. 
TEENAGER What's your name? I think you drank too much. 
THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP HER THIGH. 
THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. 
Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself. 
Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing behind him. 
David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. 
FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR. HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE. 
GLASSY EYED MAN Can I come in? 
MAN IN HOUSE Who are you? 
GLASSY EYED MAN I like your house. Can I come in?

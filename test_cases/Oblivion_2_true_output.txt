BEECH MonteCristo, #2. Do you have any idea how long I've waited, for this? He EXHALES a stream of smoke into the beam, then moves closer, into the light. Beech's face is lined with age and exposure, his skin scarred from battle. His teeth yellowed and crooked, but his arms and body are strong. Jack TENSES. Beech's voice is calm, with a barely held- back malice lurking just under the surface. 
BEECH (CONT'D) Well, let me tell you, Jack. It's been a long time... 
JACK Who are you? Where is this? BEECH inhales again. There's a piercing curiosity to Beech's gaze, studying him. 
BEECH We're deep underground. Very deep underground. 
JACK We were taken by the Scavs... 
BEECH Oh... The "Scavs". 
(BEAT) Tell me, Jack. Have you ever met a Scav, up close? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Jack is suddenly aware of other FORMS in this room. Motion, on the periphery. Hair... Feathers. Scavs? 
BEECH (CONT'D) No, of course not. You just repair the damage, keep the Drones up and killing. Don't ask many questions, do you, Jack? No part of the... 
(BITTER TASTE) .job description. Beech pulls off the cigar... 
BEECH (CONT'D) Brutal, if you think about it. The way your Drones - 
JACK The Scavs took everything from us. And if you're working with them -- 
BEECH Interesting, Jack. Interesting. You're worried I might be some kind of... Collaborator. Jack doesn't respond. 
BEECH (CONT'D) 
(ASIDE) Lllllllights! A beat, then a BANK of lights flickers on, revealing HUMANS, all around them, heavily armed. Julia GROANS, the light bringing her to. Jack moves to protect her, tracks ten, TWENTY people... He looks UP where ROWS AND ROWS of men and women stare down from above with undisguised animosity. Forty, fifty more... At the front, a strong battle-scared Scav, SYKES, hovers on the edge of violence. He's been recently WOUNDED. 
BEECH (CONT'D) You see...? We're not Aliens, Jack. We're very much human. Jack can't process. Human face after human face. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 3) 
BEECH (CONT'D) Of course that's a problem. Your drones go for human shapes, human voices. So... we change our shapes, change our voices. 
(INHALING SMOKE) The Drones still kill us, but they're not nearly so aggressive as when they smell a human target. Did you ever ask yourself why that is? 
JACK No, they're programmed to 
BEECH To what, Jack? 
(OFF JULIA) You saw it yourself. You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting her. I've been meaning to ask you, why did you do that? 
JACK Anyone would have... 
BEECH Anyone. Would have. Interesting. Julia comes around, her eyes flickering open, She SCREAMS, looking frantically for an escape. Jack GRABS her, protecting her, calming her. Beech gets CLOSE, studies Jack, what he's doing. Nods. 
BEECH (CONT'D) Very interesting. Beech moves away. Jack moves after him and suddenly forty or more weapons lock onto him. Sykes closer than any other. 
BEECH (CONT'D) Careful, Jack. I'm afraid you're not very popular here. Beech switches his gaze to Julia. 
BEECH (CONT'D) Welcome back to earth, commander. Hope you like what we've done with the place.

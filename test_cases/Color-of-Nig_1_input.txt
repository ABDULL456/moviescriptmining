A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the pavement. CHILDREN Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it ! 
Bob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants. 
CLARK Voice over. So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition. 
CLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is standing by the window. 
BILL So you were fired. 
CLARK He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves. Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave. He puts his glasses on. "Just please, please don't come back." He sits down and sighs. I do apologize for my outburst in group. 
BILL You're screwing Sondra... aren't you? 
CLARK He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start walking in the room. I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra is... A very warmhearted woman, but... While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants. Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls. Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There were 22 items I couldn't take. 
BILL It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order. 
CLARK I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect. She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except for the faint smell of perfume. 
BILL Bill sneers. Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ? CLARK Take a look at this. He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags he takes out a tattered piece of clothing. Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm terrified to go near the woman. 
FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY 
Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is wearing sunglasses. 
BILL Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa. 
THE VOICE IN THE PHONE Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice. Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the red car. Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his right. You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr. Shithead Capa. Strange sounding giggles. 
BILL Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket? 
THE VOICE IN THE PHONE Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my scalpel, Doctor. 
Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him and bumps into him. Bill jumps up. 
BILL Goddamn it ! 
The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its radiator grill. Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road downtown. The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of honking. Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on following him. To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the pavement. The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car right side. BILL Fuck you ! The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row. Fuck you! Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it. They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible. Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck... The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road. When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road. Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile-up on the road. Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill. Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away. Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ? We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes. Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward. Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back. We see the train moving behind him. 
MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose. There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on playing. 
HECTOR I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey ! He kisses a passing Mexican woman. ? Como esta? Gracias. 
BILL I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a spooky feeling. 
HECTOR Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy ! He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The puppet is dressed in a cop's costume ! Hector and Bill come to the buffet table. 
HECTOR He gets a notebook from his pocket. You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday group ? 
BILL Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain. He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet. 
HECTOR He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from the buffet. Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in intensive care. 
BILL What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ? 
HECTOR Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands died of unnatural causes. 
BILL Probably lost some body fluids. 
HECTOR And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the house on fire. So what do you think of that ? 
BILL I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves. 
A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker. 
THE VOICE Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up and your legs spread !

{"train": "THE ROOMMATE \nWritten by \nSonny Mallhi \nRevision by \nFrank Baldwin \nApril 9, 2009 \nINT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY \nSunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting patiently for this year's kids. A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun, right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY \nOVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS. They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DAY \nSARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm. She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic. No parents. She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring through the building's window at... Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces. \nINT. DORM LOBBY - DAY \nSara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT smiles up at her. \nSARA Hi. Sara Matthews. She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple silver chain around her neck. \nR.A. Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover country. She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely. \nR.A. You're in room three-sixteen. Welcome. She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY \nELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she... Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off. Sara stops in front of Room 316. \nINT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY \nShe opens the door and looks in on: A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the hall; twin beds. Heaven. Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window. She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here. First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara. Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart. It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed. \nSARA Told you we'd make it. She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles off the other cart. \nGIRL Sorry! Bad driver. Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair -- clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl smiles sheepishly. \nGIRL In case of emergency. \n(BEAT) I'm Tracy. \nSARA Sara. \nBalancing boxes, they manage to shake hands. \nEXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY \nA gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm windows. \nEXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nSara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it. \nSARA Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met this really cool biker? He's taking me to Mexico this weekend. \n(BEAT) Hello? \n(BEAT) Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding. Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a work/study ad on the wall. \nSARA Uh oh. Guys yell out. \"Show em.\" Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd. \nSARA \n(SHOUTS) Tracy. Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd. \nSARA \n(LOUDER) Tracy. Don't. Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara gasps. \nSTEPHEN Damn! Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd. Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up. \nSTEPHEN Oh. Woops. \nSARA \n(ANNOYED) I have to go clean this up. She turns. \nSTEPHEN Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him. \nSARA What plan? \nSTEPHEN To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation. \nSARA You spilled beer on me purposely? \nSTEPHEN \n(NODS) You pissed? She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen. \nSARA I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile. \nSARA I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand. \nSTEPHEN Come on. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR \nStephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of the punch. \nSARA It's pretty good. She drinks some more. \nSARA It doesn't taste that strong. \nSTEPHEN Exactly. He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of hers. \nSTEPHEN Stephen. By the way. \nSARA Sara. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER \nStephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup. Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs, grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her, bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand. \nSARA Hey, why do you get to drink beer? \nSTEPHEN Twenty-one. \nSARA Old man. \nSTEPHEN Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest. \nSTEPHEN Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands. \nSARA Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch. \nKIM \nRebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices something out of the corner of her eye. \nSARA Oh my God. \nREBECCA What? \nSara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER \nCOLLECTION. \nSARA I am so jealous. \nREBECCA I know... I've got a lot of clothes. Mind if I put some on your side? \nSARA No problem. \nREBECCA Borrow anything you want. Really. I haven't worn half of them. Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta. Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some still carry their price tags. \nSARA Jesus, some of these I've only ever seen in Vogue. \nREBECCA My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card. \nSARA Oh, you here? \nREBECCA Pasadena. Off Sara's confused look. \nREBECCA (CONT'D) About 20 minutes away. \nSARA That's cool. You can go home on weekends. Free laundry. Free meals. \nREBECCA Not gonna happen. Sara gives her a puzzled stare. \nREBECCA It's a long story.. .Let's just say nothing's free in my house. She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods at Rebecca's drawing pad. \nSARA Can I take a look? She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest. \nREBECCA No. Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh. \nREBECCA Not till it's done. Nothing personal. It's just my... process. \n(SMILES) I wouldn't want to show you anything unless it was perfect. \nSARA \n(SMILES BACK) Sure. \nEXT. CAFETERIA - DUSK \nEstablishing shot of a big college cafeteria. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DUSK \nSara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner. \nREBECCA I thought you were a design major. Why are you taking Calc and psychology? The girls get up with their trays. \nSARA (with a smirk) I am. I want to be well-rounded. (off her look) And they're requirements. \nTRACY (O.S.) Hey Sara. Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks over, but Rebecca doesn't follow. \nSARA Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my roommate, Rebecca. She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves her over. Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave. \nREBECCA Hi. \nTRACY RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you? \nKIM How 'bout Reba? Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me. \nSARA Hey. Rebecca removes her earbud. \nSARA What's your Facebook page? I'll add you as a friend. \nREBECCA I don't have a Facebook page. \nSARA Myspace? \nREBECCA Nope. I don't spend a lot of time \nON-LINE Sara stares at Rebecca. No way. \nSARA Come here. Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's shoulder. \nON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends. Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s. \nREBECCA Who's she? \nSARA Irene. She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year. \nREBECCA \n(INTRIGUED) She's an artist? \nSARA A design apprentice for Marc Jacobs. Hey, check out these posts. Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: \"Paris was amazing\"... \"Milan in the Fall\"... \"Off to Barcelona\"... etc. \nSARA I mean.. .who doesn't have a Facebook page?! Rebecca laughs. \nREBECCA Okay, okay. I'll get one. Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches right in. \nTRACY Cancel those library plans. Guess who made the guest list at Rebar? \n(BEAT) You guys in? I trust you have fake IDs? \nSARA Of course. \nREBECCA I don't. \nTRACY Yes you do. Thanks to my badass self. \nTracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it out to her. A peace offering. Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her sketchbook. \nREBECCA I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my scene. Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand. \nINT. CLUB - NIGHT \nA posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar, getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids. As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys check them out, smiling and mouthing \"Hi.\" Sara tries to ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven. \nTRACY How great is this? No parents. No curfews. \nSARA No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast. \nSARA Can I? She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse. \nTRACY Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk about the life of the party. \nSARA Don't be mean. \nTRACY I'm just saying. \nSARA She's just a little hard to get to know. \nTRACY Yeah right... \nAs Tracy rolls her eyes... The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods down the bar at... TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not so sure about this. \nSARA What do you think? \nREBECCA Thanks. \n(BEAT) So, where's Tracy? \nSARA No idea, I couldn't find her. Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table. \nREBECCA As long as I'm here... you hungry? \nSARA Starved. Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu. \nREBECCA I can't believe she ran out on you. \nSARA I know. Thanks for coming. Rebecca looks up from the menu. \nREBECCA Tracy had her shot tonight. Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show you the big city.. .the right way. And I promise I won't abandon you. Deal? Sara smiles. \nSARA Deal. \nINT. MOCA - DAY \nRebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room. \nREBECCA These are the modern pieces. A little wilder than the old stuff. She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed. Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: \"Jason\". She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She buries her cell phone in her purse. Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it. \nSARA Okay, I have no idea what this is supposed to be. \nREBECCA \n(LAUGHING) Even I don't get that one. Come on, I want to show you something. \nINT. MOCA - LATER \nRebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince exhibition. \nThey stop in front of Richard Prince's \"Nurse of Greenmeadow.\" It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask. Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her smock. \nREBECCA This is my favorite. Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her. \nREBECCA I love how he captures her personality through her eyes. It's like she really wants to help you. Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants Sara to like this painting. Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister. Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's hopeful expression. Sara brightens. \nSARA Amazing. I love it. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DAY \nSara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores. Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor. Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes. \nSARA That is so cool. \nREBECCA No graffiti in Des Moines? \nSARA Sure. \"Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy loves Rick.\" Nothing like this. Rebecca pulls out her camera. \nREBECCA Hey, smile. Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in. \nSARA Both of us. \nThey both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo parlor in the background. \nREBECCA Now that's one \"art form\" I don't get. Needles into skin? No thanks. \nSARA I have a tattoo. Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes that she's serious. \nREBECCA Really? Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over her heart, a simple tattoo: \"Emily\". \nSARA My older sister. She died when I was nine. \nREBECCA Oh, I'm sorry. \nREBECCA Sorry. I was just trying it on. Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it protectively. \nSARA This was my sister's. \nREBECCA Oh. Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca. \nSARA You can borrow anything of mine. Except for this. Okay? It's the only thing I kept of hers. Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her. \nREBECCA I'm really sorry. \nSARA It's okay. You didn't know. \nREBECCA Were you two close? \nSARA Yeah. You're the first roommate I've had since she died. So, it feels a little odd. \nREBECCA In a good way or a bad way? Sara smiles. \nSARA A good way. \nEXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING \nEstablishing of life at the quads. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nA cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of laid-back STUDENTS and... One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO- WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in his world. \nSARA \n(TO CUSTOMER) You wanted a mocha smoothie, right? O.K. Do you know what's in that? The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the lid, and... THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find... STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line. \nSTEPHEN This seems like a pattern. Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc. She leans in and speaks quietly. \nSARA Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line. \nSTEPHEN So what does it mean? \nShe coyly shrugs. \nSTEPHEN Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight. Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles. \nSTEPHEN We're having another keg party. \nSARA I.. dunno. I'm still having flashbacks from the last one. Sara laughs. \nSTEPHEN You know what? How about if I use you as my excuse not to go. Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY \nSara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A television plays in the background. \nTRACY Hey. Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold. \nSARA Hey. \nTRACY Psi U. tonight? \nSARA So you can ditch me again? \nTRACY Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And a hot tub. \nSARA That's your apology? Tracy jumps up and walks over. \nTRACY What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry -- I totally screwed up. Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She watches Tracy and Sara. Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs. \nSARA I forgive you. Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder, she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile. Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca takes it. \nAERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks ten yards behind them, waiting until... Rebecca and Sara wave \"goodbye\" to each other and head down different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up. \nSARA Hey. How was the party? Are you still the beer bong queen? But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop. \nTRACY Listen... something is up with your roommate. \nSARA What do you mean? \nTRACY She was outside my room this morning. \nSARA Doing what? \nTRACY Waiting for me. I opened my door... and there she was. Just sitting there, staring. Like some psycho. \nSARA Are you sure? \nTRACY You don't believe me? \nSARA No, it's just... why would she do that? \nTRACY Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go...I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building. Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway. Tracy leaves in a hurry. \nINT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO \nSara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each sporting a different fashion style. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It's in the hands of the designer. Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes with a text message. She discreetly takes a look. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style? FROM IRENE: \"4th & ford. be there now.\" Sara smiles at the message. Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Miss Matthews? Without missing a beat, Sara replies. \nSARA Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you don't. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style. \nSARA But it can buy you a good stylist. The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles. \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY \nSara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee. \nSARA Hey. How'd you know when my class got out? Rebecca shrugs, playing it off. \nREBECCA I'm your roommate. Sara smiles and grabs a cup. \nSARA Thanks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. QUADS - LATER \nThey walk through the quads. Other students are around, some strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class. \nSARA Listen... Tracy told me something kinda weird. She says you... scared her this morning. Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing. \nREBECCA What? \nSARA Yeah. \nREBECCA It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles. \nSARA The girl does like to party. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from Irene: \"where r u?!?!?!\" \nSARA I gotta go meet Irene. (raises her cup) Thanks for the coffee. Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - DAY \nTRACY Sara thinks you're weird. She told me. She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off that shower, too. But she can still hear running water. She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed again. The sound of running water behind it. She walks over. \nTRACY Not funny, Rebecca. (under her breath) Bitch. She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the curtain open to see... Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around -- no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower. \nTRACY Freak. Just as the warm water starts to relax her... THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca. The curtain comes right off the rings. Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both. \nRebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down. Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca. \nREBECCA So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me tell you what I think. I think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her. And I think that if you tell anyone about... what I'm about to do... you'll regret it. Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further. Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain. A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face. Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor, Rebecca looks down at... The bloody ring in her hand. \nREBECCA Nice belly ring. She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair. \nSTEPHEN I'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you. \nSARA Then let's make sure it was worth it. She gives him a slow, lingering kiss. \nSTEPHEN Duh, joke's on you. I was going to flunk anyway. She smiles. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She smiles -- must be Sara. She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara. She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her cell phone and dials. \nINT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT \nSara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye. \nSTEPHEN Thanks for helping me... not study. \nSARA Anytime. He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca. Standing just five feet away. Staring at them. \nREBECCA Where were you? \nSARA Oh, hi. \nREBECCA I kept calling and calling. \nSARA Oh. I turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on. \n(FRAZZLED) Rebecca... this is Stephen. He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him. \nREBECCA I'm going to bed now. I'm glad you're okay. She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara bites her lip, as if to say: \"What can you do?\" \nSTEPHEN You got a curfew? \nSARA Well, she's right...I shoulda called. He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss. The doors close. Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door and sighs. \nEXT. QUADS - MORNING \nSara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees. Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As they reach the fork in the path... \nSARA I guess I'll see you later. \nREBECCA Sara... \n(SHE TURNS) Last night. I was just worried about you. \nSARA You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Okay? Rebecca slowly nods. \nREBECCA Sara. We're good, right? A beat. Sara nods and smiles. \nINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nSara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them. Stephen is reading Rolling Stone. Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks to add her. \nINT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIrene opens the door and Sara walks in. \nIRENE What took you so long? \nSARA I walked. \nIRENE You didn't! \nSARA It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a student. \nIRENE Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines. \nSARA Duh? \nIRENE Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked. \nSARA What?! \nIRENE Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She answers. \nSARA Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene. \nSARA \n(TO IRENE) Do you like cats? \nIRENE Yeah, why? \nSARA We have to get rid of one. \nIRENE Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death. \nSARA You're right. (back into phone) No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know... whenever I get there. Bye. \nIRENE Who was that? \nSARA My roommate. More than a little overprotective. \nIRENE That's no fun. \nSARA So, where is it? \nIRENE What? \nSARA You said you had a surprise for me? \nIRENE Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes. \nSARA You're kidding, all of these?! Oh no. \nIRENE What ...what? \nSARA We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine. \nIRENE Oh my God, I just had the best idea. \nSARA What? \nIRENE Why don't you move in here with me? \nSARA Seriously? \nIRENE Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets. \nSARA Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about it. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER \nSara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge, moving with a purpose. She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders. \nSARA \n(INTO PHONE) Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez. Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink and walks away. \nSARA Well, actually, I was thinking I'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas. She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what she's hearing. \nSARA Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm really getting slammed... There isn't another customer in sight. \nSARA I'll call you later, okay? Tell Dad I said hello. Bye. She hangs up the phone and sighs. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DUSK \nRebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on Sara's bed. She scoops her up. \nREBECCA Looks like it's just you and me tonight. \nINT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK \nRebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry room. \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER \nRebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays with a sock on top of a nearby washer. Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles. She pets her gently. She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside. \nREBECCA \n(BABY TALK) See how nice and warm it is in there? Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass. She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and gets back up. Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time. Cuddles stumbles. Flips over. The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca, wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her last quarter. She gently places it in the slot. ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the glass at the kitten. She fingers the button. Before she pushes it -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DORM ROOM - LATER \nSara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying. She rushes over. \nSARA Hey, what's wrong? Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed. \nREBECCA Cuddles got out. \nSARA Oh no. In the dorm? \nREBECCA Outside. \nSARA What?! \nREBECCA I was doing laundry... I took her with me... She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but... \n(WHIMPERS) I'm so sorry. Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca... but the girl's so distraught, so fragile. \nSARA Maybe she'll come back. \nREBECCA \n(EMPHATIC) She won't. \nSARA I'm going to go find her. \nREBECCA Do you want me to help? But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her. \nINT. CAFETERIA - MORNING \nSara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly. \nSARA Maybe it's... just karma or something. We weren't allowed to keep her anyway. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS I'd like to see more danger in your work. Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear. But they're a little... safe. That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face. Roberts walks over to her. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Don't be afraid to go to some of the... He delicately taps her temple. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D) darker places in here. \nSARA Okay... He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks into her eyes. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS The best designers push the boundaries of what's... acceptable. They take chances. Do you like to take chances, Sara? \nSARA Sometimes. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS So do I. He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her chair. She stands in front of him, shaking. \nSARA I can't believe you just did that. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS I took a chance, that's all. With a student that I trust. \nSARA I better go. Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door... \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't blow the chance of a lifetime. She hurries out of the office. \nINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nRebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables. Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans over, concerned. \nREBECCA What's wrong? \nSARA My design professor just kissed me. Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next to Sara. \nREBECCA Are you alright? Sara nods. \nSARA Yeah, it just really creeped me out. And I think the asshole's married. \nRebecca puts her hand on Sara's. \nINT. OFFICE - NIGHT \nProfessor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He tosses some design sheets into his briefcase. He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips it onto his finger. He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop at his door. Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him. He opens the door, revealing: Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her shoulder. Roberts swallows his surprise. \nREBECCA Professor Roberts? \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS That's right. \nREBECCA I'm glad I caught you. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS Actually, I was just... But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor. \nINT. OFFICE - NIGHT \nRoberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her back inside. They face each other. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS You're not one of my students. \nREBECCA Not yet. That's why I'm here. \nShe steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner is disarming. A beat. \nREBECCA I'm failing Intro Pysch. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS And why is that? \nREBECCA Because I'm bored. I thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets. But it's brain chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay awake in class. \nPROFESSOR ROBERTS I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not sure what I can do to help. \nREBECCA Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty. Unless I can add another one in its place, I'll fall way behind in credits. Daddy won't take that very well. He might even pull the plug. Which means... \nSTEPHEN Are you ok? \nSARA Yeah, sure. \nShe smiles. Stephen smiles back. Sara looks down in her book again. \nEXT. QUADS - DAY \nSara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters. \nINT. HALLWAY \nShe walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees... \nINT. CLASSROOM \nA WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused. \nWOMAN Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll be taking over the class for the rest of the semester. Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the STUDENT next to her. \nSARA \n(WHISPERS) What happened? \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nSara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half- dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her. \nSARA Remember what I told you about Professor Roberts? \nREBECCA Yeah? \nSARA He's gone. \nREBECCA What do you mean? \nSARA Well, they're calling it a leave of absence. But what I heard... someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student. \nREBECCA Oh My God. \nSARA I know. \nREBECCA That's called Karma. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT \nSara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER \nStephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up. \nSTEPHEN I've made a decision. You ready? \nSARA Lemme hear it. \nSTEPHEN I'm gonna quit the band. \nSARA No. Really? Why? \nSTEPHEN It's a waste of time-and we suck. \nSARA Why would you say that? \nSTEPHEN Well, let me think about this. The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop. \nSARA \nJEFF That's not what I meant. She looks down at the table. \nREBECCA I'm making friends. Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat. \nJEFF Rebecca, look at me for a second. Now she looks at him. \nJEFF Your mother and I are very fond of you. \nREBECCA I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall. Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture. \nJEFF I just wanted to make sure. Good night, I'm heading back to bed. He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs. \nINT. FRONT DOOR - DAY \nSara waits by the front door. Alison walks in. \nALISON Hi Sara. \nSARA Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts. \nALISON Wonderful. Alison peers up the stairs. \nALISON Rebecca seems to be doing well. \nSARA Uhhh, yeah. I think she is. \nALISON Is she taking her medication? \nSARA Medication? Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs. Did she hear them? She walks down. \nALISON Hey sweetheart. She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed. \nREBECCA \n(TO SARA) Ready? Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words. Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully. \nALISON Have a great time, you two. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nIt's an affluent but quaint little town's main street. Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca. \nREBECCA Is everything okay? \nSARA Yeah. It's just... She wants to ask her about that medication. \nSARA Nice to see where you come from. \nREBECCA \n(EMBARRASSED) Come on. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP DAY \nSara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca. She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee. \nSARA Thanks. The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out. What's she doing with Rebecca? The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work. \nREBECCA \n(TO SARA) I used to come here like every day after school. The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting. One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks. Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches. The chatting girls all fall silent. \nSARA You know them? \nREBECCA They went to my high school. \nSARA Friends? Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye contact with the Brunette. The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves. Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance. As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible. The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances at Rebecca as they order their drinks. Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls. Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette. Suddenly, Rebecca gets up. \nSTEPHEN Your door was open. \nSARA Oh my God. \nSTEPHEN Sorry. Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck. \nSTEPHEN What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this? \nSARA That's what I intend to find out. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT \nRebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around. Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks up and we see what she's been staring at: Irene. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nSara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer. Sara googles \"Lithium and APD\", and clicks on an entry. \nSARA \n(READING) APD -- anti-social personality disorder. Also known as sociopathy. They look at each other. \nSTEPHEN Jesus. I thought she was just weird. \nSARA It says lithium can control the condition. (nodding at the bottles) Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along. \nSTEPHEN Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat. \nSARA I think it's time I moved in with Irene. \nINT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT \nA stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor. And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca. Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE \nTHAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS \nIT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? \nINT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nIrene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in. Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene. She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms. Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find Rebecca's in the mirror. \nIRENE I'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful. \nREBECCA SMILES \nREBECCA Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it? \nIRENE It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna party. Rebecca smiles. A beat. \nREBECCA Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips. \nREBECCA You're right... cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's. \nREBECCA Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate. \nIRENE As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and...no roommate. \nREBECCA What are we waiting for? \nINT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nAn alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm.. \nIRENE Shit. She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table. \nCUT TO: \nSARA Let's see it. Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just under her collarbone: \n\"EMILY\" Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her. \nREBECCA \n(SWEETLY) Think of me as your sister. Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara. \nREBECCA If you want... you can call me Emily. Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves toward Rebecca, whose grin fades. \nREBECCA What's the matter? Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone. Her eyes search Sara's for an answer. Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DORM LOBBY - DAY \nThe elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door. \nSTEPHEN This is all you're taking? \nSARA I'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town. He takes the box. Then notices -- \nSTEPHEN Where's your necklace? She instinctively rubs the base of her neck. \nSARA I can't find it. It's okay. \nSTEPHEN Sara... \nSARA I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up. \nSTEPHEN Wait here. I'll go look for it. She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nSara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back at her dorm room window... but she doesn't. Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down. Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nRebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up, taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters. She puts the camera down. \nSTEPHEN Have you seen Sara's necklace? Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca watches him. \nREBECCA What did I do? He stops searching. Looks at her. \nSTEPHEN She just needs to move on. \nREBECCA With you? He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up. \nSTEPHEN If you do find it, can you let me know? Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps out of it and walks out the door. She watches him go. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - DAY \nSara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders. \nSTEPHEN You should call someone. The dean's office. Or at least your R.A. She keeps cleaning. \nSARA And tell them what? What has she really done to me? No one can do anything. \n(BEAT) It's the weirdest thing, Stephen. The girl's own parents are afraid of her. \nSTEPHEN Well, she sure scared the shit out of me. Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of his t-shirts. \nSARA Are these dirty or clean? Stephen sniffs the shirts. \nSTEPHEN Somewhere in between. She throws the t-shirts at him. \nEXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the elevator. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note. \nSARA - I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until... however long it takes. Please. Love, \nJASON Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash. \nINT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT \nRebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain. \nINT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long pair of shears. Her \"Emily\" tattoo is starting to heal. She gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears, still looking at it in the mirror. She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter. Just above her shoulders. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing. Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain. Which she caresses in her hand. \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nSara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book. Enjoying the silence. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT \nA raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT GIRL smiles at him. \nGIRL Help me find the keg? \nSTEPHEN Sure, I have to go look for my girlfriend anyway. She walks away. \"Jerk\". He grins... and now checks his watch. Where's Sara? \nINT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara? The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her. \nAs she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers. She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an open room. She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now plucks the master key card off the cart. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed. The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep. Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the floor. She's in just bra and panties now. She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake. \nJASON \nWHA-- \nREBECCA Shhhh. She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck. \nJASON Sara? \n(BEAT) You got my voicemail. \nREBECCA Mm-hmmm. Kissing his back now, moving lower. \nJASON Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good. She works her way back up to his ear. \nREBECCA \n(WHISPERING) Turn over. \nDid that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees... The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable \"Emily\" tattoo. \nREBECCA \nREBECCA Stop it. Stop saying things you don't mean. I protected you. From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten... and That scumbag of a professor... \n(BEAT) Even that loser ex-boyfriend of yours. \nSARA What're you talking about? What'd you do to them? What'd you do to Jason? \nREBECCA I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. She looks at Irene. Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in the eye. She puts everything she has into this. \nSARA Rebecca, please forgive me. A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up. \nREBECCA Now we can start all over again. Let's make things the way they were, Sara. That first day. Just the two of us. Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands. \nSARA Rebecca... \nREBECCA After all... you can only have one best friend. \nSARA No! Don't! Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her... \nREBECCA Lay still bitch. \nSARA Please. Don't do this... Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die. She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun. \nREBECCA Stop! I mean it. Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming. Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor. She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair from Sara's face. \nREBECCA \n(GENTLE) Shh... I'm so sorry. Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It skitters across the floor and out the door into the living room. Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a chokehold. Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again. Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip. She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara rises... Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of her. As Sara gasps for breath... Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun. Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it. Rebecca turns around and goes for the door. \nSara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's head. IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But... Rebecca bangs the door. \nREBECCA (O.S.) Don't do this Sara! \nINT. BEDROOM \nSara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against the steel handcuffs. Useless. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door. \nREBECCA Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I just want to be your friend. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSara and Irene are frantic. \nIRENE My phone. My phone. She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table. She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut! \nSARA Shit! \nIRENE The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nRebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and furniture around. She finds it. Picks the gun off the floor. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options. \nEXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT \nSara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires. \n", "test1_input": "SARA Who are you?! \nGIRL Rebecca. Your roommate. Sara calms, catching on. \nSARA What are you doing? \nREBECCA Taking your picture. \nSARA Why? Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach. \nSARA Oh shit. Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca smiles. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER \nSara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room, holding her head. The door is slightly open. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her eyes are closed. \nSARA \n(WHISPERS) Rebecca? No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it, and turns toward the wall. Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go to sleep. \nEXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY \nIt's the middle of the day and students carry their books everywhere. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nSara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see... Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the light of day, we see that she's a knockout. Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that flank an awesome stereo system. Rebecca sees that Sara's awake. \nREBECCA Hey Sara. Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened last night? Rebecca smiles. \nREBECCA We met last night. \nSARA Right... (racking her brain) Starts with a... \"T\"? \nREBECCA Close. Rebecca. She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin. \nREBECCA Come on. It'll help, trust me. Sara washes down the aspirin. \nSARA Thanks. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. \nSARA \n(SUDDENLY PANICKED) I didn't throw up on you, did I? \nREBECCA \n(LAUGHS) No. You made it to the bathroom. Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved to her side. Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca is staring straight back at us. No smile. \nSARA Did you do those? Rebecca nods. \nSARA They're really cool. \nREBECCA I just like capturing my moods. A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now. \nSARA Rebecca -- did you take my picture last night? \nREBECCA \n(LAUGHING) Yeah. It's just something I do. For my drawings. \n(BEAT) C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The walk will help your head. Sara rolls over, groaning. \nSARA It's too damn early for me. \n", "test1_true": "SARA Holy shit! \nINT. BOOKSTORE - DAY \nSara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks. All look used and worn. Fashion Design. Psychology. Calculus. She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as another GIRL reaches too. They both pull back, neither sure who has claim to it. \nGIRL So what do we do? Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit. \nSARA Nice bag. Dior? \nGIRL \n(FLATTERED) Yeah. Sara snatches the book. \nSARA I'm on financial aid. \nINT. BOOKSTORE - LATER \nSara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the stuff she needs. Sara scans Rebecca's books. They're all art books, shiny and new. Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: \"JASON\". She sighs. Her finger hovers over the \"talk\" button. A beat. She hits it right before it goes to voicemail. \nSARA \n(ANNOYED) Jason. What are you doing? \nJASON (O.S.) I just wanted to hear your voice. \nSARA I told you not to do this. \nJASON (O.S.) I need to talk to you. \nSARA You're just making it harder. \nJASON (O.S.) Sara, listen I... I want to come out there. \nSARA \n(SNAPS) But you didn't come out here, remember. That's the problem. She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her. \nSARA (CONT'D) \n(QUIETER) I've gotta go. Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered. \nREBECCA That didn't sound good. Boyfriend? \nSARA Ex. Off Rebecca's confused look. \nSARA It's complicated. A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up. They walk along the stacks of books. \nSARA We dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together. \n(BEAT) We both applied to Brown. I got in; he got wait-listed. I stuck to our agreement and we both committed here. Then two weeks ago...a spot opened up at Brown ...and.. \nREBECCA No?! He took it? (Sara nods glumly) What an asshole. \nSARA Yep. \nREBECCA Do you miss him? \nSARA Sometimes I think I do. \nREBECCA It's hard to let go. \n(SMILES) Believe me, I know. But, you're in college now. A girl's gotta move on. Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the register. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 3060, "test2_input": "SARA So...let's go back to your place. She gives him a seductive grin. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nRebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00 a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away. She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial button. She starts to dial... but kills the call. She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly: A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen: \n\"JASON\". A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens. \nJASON (O.S.) Sara? \nREBECCA Mmmm? \nJASON (O.S.) Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can we talk... about us? Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now she lies down. \nREBECCA \n(WHISPERS) I miss you. She moves her hand across her stomach. \nJASON (O.S.) \n(RELIEVED) You do? \nREBECCA I want you, Jason. \nJASON (O.S.) I.. . want you, too. But... Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties. \nREBECCA I miss touching you. Do you miss touching me? \nJASON (O.S.) Like you wouldn't believe. \nREBECCA Prove it. \nINT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks it open and peeks inside. His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes. \nSTEPHEN Just give me thirty seconds. \nSARA You're kidding. \nBut he slips into the room and closes the door behind him. Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME \nStephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans, clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag. \nSTEPHEN Almost there. \nSARA (O.S.) (through the door) I'm going to start taking my clothes off out here. \nSTEPHEN Yeah, right. He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster. \nSARA (O.S.) Oops! There goes my shirt... She's got his attention now. He speeds up. \nSTEPHEN You know I don't believe you. \n(WORRIED) Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to be my strip tease. \nSARA (O.S.) There go the jeans. He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed. \nSTEPHEN I'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again. \nSARA (O.S.) Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom? Stephen stops and stares at the door. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME \nSara stands there, fully dressed. She looks down the empty hallway. \n", "test2_true": "STEPHEN I knew you didn't have the guts. She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams shut behind them. \nINT. DORM ROOM - SAME \nRebecca is breathing harder and faster now. Still holding the phone, from which we hear Jason's moans. \nREBECCA Say my name, Jason. Until I tell you to stop. She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers. \nJASON (O.S.) Sara... Sara... Sara... Rebecca writhes, eyes closed. \nINT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM \nSara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked. He lies on top of her. Looking into her eyes. Sweet and intimate. \nSTEPHEN Sara... \nINT. DORM ROOM - SAME \nRebecca writhes and moans. \nJASON (O.S.) Sara... Sara... They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish. A long beat. \nJASON (O.S.) (catching his breath) Jesus, Sara. That was incredible. Rebecca smiles. \nJASON (O.S.) I miss you so much. Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her eyes. \nREBECCA Don't ever call me again. She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log. \nEXT. CARNEGIE DORM - MORNING \nCarnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nSara, hair mussed up but eyes shining. Sara opens her door and steps in. She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down her throat. But Rebecca smiles. \nREBECCA Well, good morning. \nSARA Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot my phone. \nREBECCA No problem. Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly checks. No calls. Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles. \nREBECCA Come on...don't I get any details?? \nSARA \n(SMILING) A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell. They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them. \nSARA You want to go get some breakfa-- Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down the hallway. \nSARA Oh no. Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed. \nINT. HALLWAY \nSara turns the corner to see... The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms. Sara apprehensively walks up to him. \nR.A. Is this your cat, Sara? \nSARA Maybe... \nR.A. She's cute... She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She turns to walk back to the room. \nR.A. And if you keep her, I lose my job. Do we understand each other? She stops. Turns. Looks at him. \nSARA Yes. Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway. They exchange despondent looks. Screwed. \n", "test2_id": 3061, "test3_input": "SARA Just say you'll miss me. \nSTEPHEN I'll miss you. Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives Stephen an \"I win\" look as Sara closes the door. \nINT. CAR - DRIVING: LATER \nSara looks down at her phone. \nSARA I haven't heard from Jason in weeks. It's weird how he just stopped calling. \nREBECCA It's what you wanted, right? Sara nods, reassuring herself. \nSARA Yeah. Yeah it is. Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile. \nEXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK \nRebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK \nRebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the mansion. Sara is in shock. \nSARA This is your home? \nREBECCA It's my parents house. It was never a home. \nINT. FOYER - DUSK \nRebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as Sara closes the door. Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father gives her an awkward hug. \nDAD \n(SURPRISED) We didn't think you would make it. \nHer mother sees the bruises on her face. \nMOM \n(ALARMED) What happened? \nREBECCA Nothing. \nDAD Nothing? This isn't nothing. \nREBECCA \n(SNAPS) Leave it alone. Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely raising her arms. \nDAD Hello. And you are? \nSARA I'm Sara. She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't tell them? \nREBECCA Sara's my roommate. \nDAD \n(PLEASED) I'm Jeff. Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara. \nMOM It's so great to meet you, Sara. I'm Alison. Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm. \nREBECCA Come on, let me show you my room. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DUSK \nRebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara. \nSARA You didn't tell them we were coming? \n", "test3_true": "SARA These are interesting. \nREBECCA Yeah, some of my high school work. I haven't gotten around to takin them down. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nFamily and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but not pretentious. Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth. \nSARA Rebecca's a pretty great artist. \nJEFF Yeah, we think Rebecca is so talented. Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery. \nSARA She's an awesome roommate, too. \nJEFF (looks at his daughter, \nPOINTEDLY) That's nice to hear and I'm sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before. Rebecca stares at her father. \nREBECCA Dad! \nJEFF What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these people? \nALISON Sara, I'll make up a room for you -- \nREBECCA She'll stay in my room. Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a makeshift bed in the middle of the floor. \nREBECCA We can share the bed if you want. Sara looks down at her own \"bed\" and takes a glance at the walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the drawings of Rebecca looking at her. \nSARA Sure. Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back. Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed. \nREBECCA Thanks for coming. \nSARA Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family. \nREBECCA Done. Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair. \nSara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt something. She closes them again. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nJeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's lived here long enough to know his way in the dark. \nKITCHEN Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father. Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge. \nJEFF Becs. You scared me. Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty look. We know how much she hates nicknames. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door. \nINT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nSara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see... \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky. \nJEFF How're you doing? \nREBECCA Fine. My grades are good. \n", "test3_id": 3062}

{"test1_input": "INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIrene opens the door and Sara walks in. \nIRENE What took you so long? \nSARA I walked. \nIRENE You didn't! \nSARA It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a student. \nIRENE Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines. \nSARA Duh? \nIRENE Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked. \nSARA What?! \nIRENE Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She answers. \nSARA Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene. \nSARA \n(TO IRENE) Do you like cats? \nIRENE Yeah, why? \nSARA We have to get rid of one. \nIRENE Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death. \nSARA You're right. (back into phone) No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know... whenever I get there. Bye. \nIRENE Who was that? \nSARA My roommate. More than a little overprotective. \nIRENE That's no fun. \nSARA So, where is it? \nIRENE What? \nSARA You said you had a surprise for me? \nIRENE Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes. \nSARA You're kidding, all of these?! Oh no. \nIRENE What ...what? \nSARA We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine. \nIRENE Oh my God, I just had the best idea. \nSARA What? \nIRENE Why don't you move in here with me? \nSARA Seriously? \nIRENE Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets. \nSARA Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about it. \n", "test1_true": "(BEAT) So, how's Jason? I really liked him. \nSARA We broke up. \nIRENE Yeah ...he sucked. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nSara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags spill out into the room, taking up floor space. Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of Irene and some girlfriends. \nREBECCA Hey. What're those? \nSARA Irene gave them to me. She had a lot more but we don't have the room. \nREBECCA Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, huh? \nSARA Well, maybe that's not a problem. \nREBECCA Really? \nSARA Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her. \nREBECCA What? \n(BEAT) You want to move? \nSARA No, of course not. I love living here... with you. Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a bright spin on things. \nSARA Look, I'd still technically be living here. So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate. Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space. I'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there. We'd both have a lot more space. \nREBECCA I don't want more space. I want... She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence. \nSARA Nothing's set in stone. It's just something to think about. Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles. As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares across the room at... Cuddles. \nEXT. QUADS - DAY \nAs Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking by herself. \nSARA Tracy! Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her. \nSARA Tracy... hey. \nTRACY Oh, hey. Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle. Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's. \nSARA I heard you changed dorms. \nTRACY Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a better vibe. \nSARA Well, we should get together. Like grab a bite or something. Right? \nREBECCA (O.S.) Sara! Sara turns and waves at Rebecca. \nSARA Hi. Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara. \nTRACY \n(TO SARA) I'll call you. But she's already walking away. \nSARA Tracy?! \nREBECCA What was that about? \nSARA I don't know. She just walked away. \nREBECCA Well, she's always been a flake. \n", "test1_id": 3060, "test2_input": "STEPHEN Are you ok? \nSARA Yeah, sure. \nShe smiles. Stephen smiles back. Sara looks down in her book again. \nEXT. QUADS - DAY \nSara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters. \nINT. HALLWAY \nShe walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees... \nINT. CLASSROOM \nA WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused. \nWOMAN Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll be taking over the class for the rest of the semester. Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the STUDENT next to her. \nSARA \n(WHISPERS) What happened? \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nSara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half- dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her. \nSARA Remember what I told you about Professor Roberts? \nREBECCA Yeah? \nSARA He's gone. \nREBECCA What do you mean? \nSARA Well, they're calling it a leave of absence. But what I heard... someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student. \nREBECCA Oh My God. \nSARA I know. \nREBECCA That's called Karma. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT \nSara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten. \nINT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER \nStephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up. \nSTEPHEN I've made a decision. You ready? \nSARA Lemme hear it. \nSTEPHEN I'm gonna quit the band. \nSARA No. Really? Why? \nSTEPHEN It's a waste of time-and we suck. \nSARA Why would you say that? \nSTEPHEN Well, let me think about this. The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop. \nSARA \n", "test2_true": "SARA Hold it. Did you just say girlfriend? \nSTEPHEN You heard me. \nSARA So you think it'll be fun to stay here during Thanksgiving? \nSTEPHEN Dinner at the frat, the football games. Don't forget the always awkward, homoerotic humor. \nSARA Sounds like a blast. \nSTEPHEN Oh. For sure. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nA somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now... Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot. And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's getting more and more numb to the blows. She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large, retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places the knife against her skin and... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nSara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her things and runs over to her. \nSARA Oh my God. What happened? She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms. \nSARA Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe now. Talk to me. \nREBECCA I was looking for Cuddles. A man... pulled me into an alley. He tried... Sara holds her. She can't finish. \nSARA It's okay. It's okay. Shhh. \nREBECCA I got away. \nSARA You're alright now. Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps. \nINT. DORM ROOM - DAY \nRebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches. \nSARA It's not deep, thank God. But you should see a doctor. \nREBECCA No. \nSARA Rebecca, you need to. And then the police. \nRebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job. \nREBECCA I don't want to. I can't. Sara pulls out her cell phone. \nSARA You're calling them, or I am. There's a psycho walking around this campus. \nREBECCA \n(CRYING AGAIN) Please. I didn't see him. She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts. \nSARA Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let me help you. Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently as she works. \nEXT. STREET - DORM - DAY \nSara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen. Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go home for the holiday. \nSARA Sorry about not staying. But, Rebecca... \nSTEPHEN I get it. \n(KISSES HER) I'm going to make out with my pillow and pretend it's you. \n", "test2_id": 3061, "test3_input": "SARA Just say you'll miss me. \nSTEPHEN I'll miss you. Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives Stephen an \"I win\" look as Sara closes the door. \nINT. CAR - DRIVING: LATER \nSara looks down at her phone. \nSARA I haven't heard from Jason in weeks. It's weird how he just stopped calling. \nREBECCA It's what you wanted, right? Sara nods, reassuring herself. \nSARA Yeah. Yeah it is. Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile. \nEXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK \nRebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK \nRebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the mansion. Sara is in shock. \nSARA This is your home? \nREBECCA It's my parents house. It was never a home. \nINT. FOYER - DUSK \nRebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as Sara closes the door. Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father gives her an awkward hug. \nDAD \n(SURPRISED) We didn't think you would make it. \nHer mother sees the bruises on her face. \nMOM \n(ALARMED) What happened? \nREBECCA Nothing. \nDAD Nothing? This isn't nothing. \nREBECCA \n(SNAPS) Leave it alone. Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely raising her arms. \nDAD Hello. And you are? \nSARA I'm Sara. She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't tell them? \nREBECCA Sara's my roommate. \nDAD \n(PLEASED) I'm Jeff. Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara. \nMOM It's so great to meet you, Sara. I'm Alison. Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm. \nREBECCA Come on, let me show you my room. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DUSK \nRebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara. \nSARA You didn't tell them we were coming? \n", "test3_true": "SARA These are interesting. \nREBECCA Yeah, some of my high school work. I haven't gotten around to takin them down. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nFamily and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but not pretentious. Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth. \nSARA Rebecca's a pretty great artist. \nJEFF Yeah, we think Rebecca is so talented. Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery. \nSARA She's an awesome roommate, too. \nJEFF (looks at his daughter, \nPOINTEDLY) That's nice to hear and I'm sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before. Rebecca stares at her father. \nREBECCA Dad! \nJEFF What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these people? \nALISON Sara, I'll make up a room for you -- \nREBECCA She'll stay in my room. Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a makeshift bed in the middle of the floor. \nREBECCA We can share the bed if you want. Sara looks down at her own \"bed\" and takes a glance at the walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the drawings of Rebecca looking at her. \nSARA Sure. Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back. Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed. \nREBECCA Thanks for coming. \nSARA Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family. \nREBECCA Done. Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair. \nSara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt something. She closes them again. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nJeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's lived here long enough to know his way in the dark. \nKITCHEN Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father. Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge. \nJEFF Becs. You scared me. Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty look. We know how much she hates nicknames. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door. \nINT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nSara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see... \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky. \nJEFF How're you doing? \nREBECCA Fine. My grades are good. \n", "test3_id": 3062}

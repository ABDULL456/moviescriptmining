THE CAMERA SLOWLY FADES TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. LIVING ROOM  VERY LATE AT NIGHT 
WIDE SHOT 
Ted Kramer paces back and forth, eyeing the phone. Then, coming to a decision, he crosses to it, picks up the receiver and starts to dial. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APT. BLDG.  LATE AT NIGHT 
WIDE SHOT 
The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights. HOLD as we HEAR: 
Sound: The phone ringing. Then: 
WOMAN'S VOICE (obviously asleep) Huh... Hello? 
TED (righteous) All right, Thelma... That's it. I've had it. You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay? I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Ted, what are you talking about?! 
TED Don't play innocent with me, Thelma. You know perfectly well what's going on. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (exasperated) Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna? 
TED Ha! You tell me. 
Sound-effect, as Ted slams down the receiver. 
Instantly a light is turned on two floors below. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT 
ON THE FRONT DOOR 
As we HEAR: 
Sound-effect: the doorbell rings. 
A moment later Ted opens the door and THELMA PHILLIPS enters. She is a neighbor (Apt. 6-B) and Joanna Kramer's best friend. About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were divorced. 
Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's son 
(Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter (Kim). 
With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain amount of friction. 
Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She dresses well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a therapist twice a week. She is also given to acting the lay analyst with her friends. Thelma is generous with her advice, sharing the wealth so to speak. With all of this she is kind, loyal and a loving friend. At the moment, however, she is all business. 
THELMA (looking around, suspiciously) All right. What's going on? 
ON TED 
From his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost between them. 
TED All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'll tell you exactly what's going on. 
THELMA Look, Ted, all I  
TED (starting to really roll) I came home tonight. We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency. Do you know what that means?! Do you understand what that means? It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life. 
THELMA Ted, all I wanted to know was where 
TED (not letting her get a word in edgewise) I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything. Pow she's out the door. 
THELMA OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something. 
TED (sarcastic) Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore. 
THELMA Ted, don't be so hostile. 
Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the Ambassador to the Court of St. James. However, during the following, he begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with real vehemence. 
TED Hostile? (pow) Me? (whack) Thelma, I'm not hostile. (thud) I am anything but hostile. (sock) But if you want to know what I am. I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I just want to know one thing, okay? Just one thing... Why? That's all I want to know... Why? 
THELMA (how to say this) Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and... well, she told me a lot of... ah, things about the two of you. 
TED (instantly nervous) Things? What kind of things? 
THELMA (clearly she knows more than she's willing to say) I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and  
TED (flash of anger) Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life. She's got a husband that loves her. She's got a terrific kid. She's got a wonderful home  
THELMA (getting mad herself) What d'you know about how Joanna felt? You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell. 
TED Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?! Did it?! For one thing she's always thirty minutes late. You can set your watch by it  
THELMA (exasperated) So she's late. What's the big deal. That's just a way of saying, "Pay attention to me." 
TED (not listening) Two. She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it. Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially  
THELMA Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps. 
TED Joanna said that? 
Thelma nods.

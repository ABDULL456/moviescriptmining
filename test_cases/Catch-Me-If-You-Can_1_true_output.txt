S SMAN Now all you a is one of those little Fore gny-ï¿½ts cars he drives. 
The lab is packed with AGENT re searching for a fingerprint match. Joe Shaye i s head from a microscope, rubs his eyes. 
FOX Joe, I got something! Joe rushes over to Agent Fox, who is holding up TWO SETS OF 
FINGERPRINTS. 
FOX (CONT'D) I was looking through the wanted criminal file, and there it was! Look at that! Joe takes the file from Fox and opens it.

AMDURSKY They describe The Skywayman as a thirty-year-old -- dark hair --six- feet -- same fucking guy! 
JOE SHAYE It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here. 
FOX Maybe there's a reason he didn't register. He could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and he's not an American 
CITIZEN- 
JOE SHAYE Maybe he's not thirty. Somebody call New York, get a list of juvenile runaways from the NYPD. 102 EXT. - PAULA ABAGNALE'S HOME. `e_ VMIGL ISLAND. - MORNING 102 TEN FBI AGENTS have surrounded a 4 /STORY HOME IN LONG ISLAND.

103 CONTINUED: 103 Paula motions to a FRAMED PICTURE of Jack Wright. PAULA (cont' d) He advised me not to speak to you. So I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to him. 
JOE SHAYE Of course, Ma'am. Do you have a current address for your ex-husband, Frank Abagnale? 
PAULA No. He moves around a lot these days. How are those biscuits? 
AMDURS KY Very good. 
JOE SHAYE Ma'am, you filed a police report last year for a juvenile runaway named Frank Ana1e, Jr. 
PAULA He's forging checks? That's why you're here? 
(LAUGHING) Half the kids his age are on dope, throwing rocks at police, and you're scaring me to death because my son is forging checks? 
JOE SHAYE What he's doing is a federal offense. 
PAULA (CONT'D) A young boy has to eat, has to have a place to sleep. What do you want him to do? His father can't help him. Paula gets off the couch and grabs her purse.

Frank is walking through the airport, eyeing several UNIFORMED COPS who are scattered throughout the terminal, all holding the yearbook picture of FRANK. Frank sees FOUR UNDERCOVER COPS walking toward him, then sees TWO DETECTIVES checking the identification of a PAN AM PILOT. Frank nervously steps into the NEWSSTAND, hides behind a magazine rack as he slowly reaches up and takes off his Pilot's cap and sunglasses.

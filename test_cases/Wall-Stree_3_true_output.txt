Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day. 
MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel. 
BUD Morning, Dan. What's looking good today? 
STEEPLES If I know I wouldn't be in this business. Get out while you're young, kid. I came here one day, I sat down, and look at me now. 
Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms. 
BUD ...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer? 
CHARLIE ...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal? 
BUD ...if I had your looks, better. 
CHARLIE (used to it) ...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor. 
BUD ...not that you learned anything, Chunk. 
Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework. 
BUD I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv. 
MARV (O.S.) Yeah, where's your machine gun. 
BUD Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what? 
His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read. 
MARV (scowling) Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down. (confidential) Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest. 
BUD Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare. 
LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department. 
BUD (friendly) You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry... 
MANNHEIM Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it. 
MARV Take 5 years for that company to turn around. 
MANNHEIM ...but they got a good new drug. Stick to the fundamentals, that's how IBM and Hilton were built...good things sometimes take time. 
The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH booms over the intercom. 
We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face. 
LYNCH Attention. Please. Office Production is down ten percent this week. I recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. And don't forget -- double commissions today on our 'A' or better bond funds. (looking in Bud and Marv's direction) Especially you rookies. Also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow. 
Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes 9:30. The CREDITS close. 
BUD And they're off and running! 
The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot. 
BROKERS Here's a hot lead... Have I got one for you.... sell ... dump it all!! ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!... July fifties. April thirties...how bout those Decembers? You see where they're going? ... Morgan is selling a billion one at the close. Yeah. That's right, they're selling all over the place... we're still long on the treasuries -- $110 million. What about the Japs? ...Where am I? (confused at all the phone lights) We gotta lot of lights here! Let's pick 'em up. 
BUD (on phone) Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top, forget the hundred. What about Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's go long...Conwest Air -- let me check it... 
He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by. 
BUD (O.S. CONT'D) Up an eighth. How many you want? It's on the floor. 
He writes the order up. 
A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes. 
Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich. He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch.

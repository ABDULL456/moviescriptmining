SCOTT I love it! Those cocky Israeli bastards thought they hit the jackpot. Got the Jackal right in their own backyard... 
MONROE State Department's goin' apeshit. And the Navy... Admiral Trost was so pissed he was ready to shell the port of Haifa. 
Jack, however, isn't sniggering. He's thinking hard as he looks at all the information on the desk. 
JACK You're not gettin' it are ya? 
SCOTT What? 
JACK These weren't some yokels... This was the Israeli General Security Service... The Mossad. The best in the business. They have the most complete dossier there is on Carlos, the latest pictures of him... everything. I mean what's that tell you? 
SCOTT That they really ate it this time. 
JACK Scott... doesn't it hurt to walk around like that with your head up your ass... I mean isn't it painful? 
His eyes glance down to the pictures, especially the photos of the children. Something begins to click. 
EXT. NORFOLK, VA - DAY 
SUPER: NORFOLK, VIRGINIA 
EXT. T-BALL FIELD - NORFOLK, VA - DAY 
Almost nothing is as cute as 3 foot 5 inch 6-year-olds struggling to play the most elementary form of baseball, T- ball. 
ANGLE ON - 6 - YEAR-OLD JOEY RAMIREZ 
He is the first baseman and he is intent upon the batter who stands at the T. 
ANGLE ON - THE PARENTS 
cheering their kids on. Amongst them we recognize MAURA, Annibal Ramirez's wife, who is cheering for her son's team. She holds a ten month old baby as she cheers. 
NEW ANGLE 
on Annibal Ramirez, resplendent in his summer whites, his face still showing the faintest remnants of bruises at the hands of the Israelis. He holds his sea bag in his hand. There is a waiting taxi behind him as he strides over towards the baseball diamond. 
ANGLE ON - JOEY 
He sees his father just as the batter hits the ball. 
JOEY Poppi! 
The pitcher scoops the grounder up and tosses it to Joey whose eyes however have lit up at the sight of his sailor father home from the sea so the ball hits him in the side of the head and he goes down. Ramirez wants to rush out to his son, but Joey straightens himself up quickly, not wanting to be embarrassed by an over-protective parent. 
ANGLE ON - MAURA AND RAMIREZ 
Maura has followed her son's gaze at Ramirez and feels no embarrassment whatsoever as she runs into his arms, still holding her baby. She kisses him. 
MAURA I thought you weren't coming back till tomorrow... 
RAMIREZ I wanted to be here for his game. Look how beautiful she is! 
He picks up the baby and kisses her. 
RAMIREZ Just like her mother. 
MAURA What happened to your eye? 
RAMIREZ Nothing. Just fell. It doesn't matter. I'm home. 
EXT. RAMIREZ'S HOUSE - NORFOLK - A MONTH LATER - DAY 
It's a stucco, single-level structure in a clean, middle income neighborhood. Jack Shaw pulls up, crosses out of his car and knocks on the door. The door opens revealing Ramirez in a T-shirt and pair of sweats. Jack looks at his face, the unmistakable face of Carlos. 
RAMIREZ Joey watch Yolanda... okay? 
JACK Jesus... 
RAMIREZ I beg your pardon? 
JACK Lieutenant Commander Ramirez my name is Jack Shaw... I'm with the government... I'd like to talk to you about what happened in Israel. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - BACKYARD - NORFOLK - DAY 
ANGLE - CLOSE ON 
the barbeque's coals which burst into flame as fluid and then match are applied. OVER this we hear 
RAMIREZ I want to sue them, okay? I want to sue the guy who broke my ribs. I want to sue their government and their Mossad... and I want to sue Golda Meir!

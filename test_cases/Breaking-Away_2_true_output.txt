KATHERINE I haven't ridden double since I was a small girl and I've never been serenaded. So, it was a lovely evening. 'Molte grazia.' She's a little embarrassed by her Italian and Dave, the pro, gestures that it wasn't so bad. She leans over. They kiss.

INT. MI IS CAR - DUSK 82 
MIKE I really thought I was a great quarterback in high school. I still think so. I can't even bring myself to light a cigarette 'cause I keep thinking I should- stay in shape. And you know what gets me. Living here and reading in the papers how some hotshot kid is the new star on the college team. Every year there'll be a new one and it's never going to be me. I'll just be Mike. Twenty-year-old Mike. Thirty-year-old Mike. Old mean old man Mike. But the college kids will never get old...out of shape...'cause new ones come every year. And they'll keep calling us 'cutters.' To them it's a dirty word but to me it'll just be something else I never got a chance to be. He falls silent and sticks a cigarette in his mouth. His genuine confession has caught everybody,. including himself, off guard. The guys look at him with sympathy and under- standing but Mike doesn't like that. He starts the car up.

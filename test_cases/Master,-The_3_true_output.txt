MARY SUE (CONT'D) He was working on a book that showed how the Russians used narcosynthesis and physical torture and how it worked as it did. That was interrupted. He had a technology oh psychological warfare to present to the Defense Department. All that was interrupted, lost. Each time he sits to write, a new attack is launched against him and he spends too much time on defending himself. I tell him to ignore it, but he's so sensitive... 
FREDDIE Who's attacking him? 
MARY SUE People that are scared. People that are greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice about being at sea. He gets his studies done, advances the learning, and he writes BOOK II. 
FREDDIE What's a time-hole? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SMALL CLASSROOM - LATER. 
It's a dimly lit little room. A few folding chairs and a small stage. A YOUNG GOD LOOKING COUPLE: WAYNE and SUSAN DUNBAR (late 20s) are on stage. She is lying down, eyes close, he is sitting in a chair next to her, students watch as he runs an exercise with her; Mary Sue has brought Freddie in here and sits with him in the back.. .Freddie watches: 
WAYNE Say, "back beyond" and return to the pre- natal area. 
SUSAN Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. 
WAYNE Continue please... 
SUSAN Back beyond..I Have.. something in my face... It feels like I am being pushed. 
WAYNE Contact it more closely and continue to repeat. 
SUSAN Back beyond. Back beyond. It's getting stronger. 
WAYNE 
CONTINUE 
SUSAN I hear a voice..It's my father's voice. 
WAYNE Listen to the words and repeat them, please. 
SUSAN He is talking to my mother. The face pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable. It keeps going up and down and it hurts. 
WAYNE Repeat his words, please. 
SUSAN "I don't want to come in you now. Let's wait." The pressure is banging my face. Into my face. My mother is there, her voice... 
WAYNE What is your mother saying? Please, if you hear her? 
SUSAN She saying "well get out of there then. I don't want you in me at all if your not there to come. Get in to come." She's mad. 
WAYNE Please return to the start of this and recount. 
SUSAN I wonder what they're doing? I hear a squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my. 
WAYNE Recount please. 
SUSAN A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my fathers voice say, "oh honey..I wont come in you now. I'm not too sure I like children that well and I have my job to worry about..." And my mother must shove him - a sharper pain here - "THEN I DON'T 
IN THERE AT ALL, GET OUT.." 
WAYNE Return to the beginning and recount it again, please. CU. FREDDIE's FACE Listening. Mary Sue leans over and whispers: 
MARY SUE (WHISPERS) Do you understand what's happening? 
FREDDIE Yes. She hold her pregnant stomach; 
MARY SUE We record everything. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHIP - VARIOUS. NEXT MORNING. 
FREDDIE moves around, CAMERA follows him, collecting VARIOUS SUPPLIES to start making a home-made potion of booze. POTATOES, PAINT THINNER, ORANGES, YEAST. (TBD, OTHER CONTENTS OF THE SHIP) that could go into a recipe -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BOOZE ROOM - LATER. 
He's set up in an area of the ship to start distilling BOOZE from the found ingredients on the ship. WATCH, HOLD THIS. The BARTENDER/FOLLOWER is here to give him some help. (poss. Bartender telling him how came to 'the cause' here...) 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER. 
HE WALKS THROUGH THE LIBRARY ROOM, WATCHING A GROUP OF 
FOLLOWERS READING, STUDYING, TALKING. LISTENING TO 
HEADPHONES WITH MASTER'S VOICE SPEAKING. THIS IS THEIR 
STUDY TIME. He slips a PAIR of HEADPHONES ON, TAKES A SEAT AND LISTENS. This is a recording of a LIVE LECTURE BY MASTER: 
MASTER (V.0.) .someone came up to me the other day, and I had to say...I had to correct him. He said, "I heard the Cause can fix me.." I looked down at him and he'd lost his legs. He's sitting in a wheel chair and had no legs to speak of. I said, "We can do very many things, sir...but no, we cannot replace your legs. This is how rumors get started." Let's talk about what we can do... FREDDIE looks around and watches all the STUDENTS on their headphones. He tries to flirt and make eye contact with all the WOMEN. 
MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) When did you decide you had limited potentials and capabilities? You've forgotten that this is all just a dirty old game that YOU created. An AID (Female, 40s) comes over;

The PLYMOUTH SKIDS to a stop behind the Abbott's Town & Country station wagon. Jacey jumps out of his car and rushes into the boathouse.

LLOYD I have plans for my daughters, Mr. Holt, and they don't include you. I know you. I know you better than you know me. I know all there is to know about screwing your way into a wealthy family. I'll never let you screw your way into mine. 
JACEY Where is she?      Where's Alice? 
Jacey turns and rushes out of the boathouse. 
119   EXT. BOATHOUSE - PLYMOUTH - DAY                               119 
Jacey hops into the PLYMOUTH and PEELS OUT as he speeds away. Lloyd Abbott steps out of the boathouse and approaches the station wagon. 
120     EXT. PLYMOUTH (STREETS OF HALEY) - DAY                        120 
Jacey speeds recklessly back into town.

Jacey skids into the driveway and leaps out of the car. 
122     INT. ABBOTT HOME - ENTRY HALL AND STAIRS - DAY                122 
Jacey bursts through the front door and cries out. 
JACEY Alice!   Alice! 
Joan Abbott rushes into the entry hall. 
JOAN Dear God! 
JACEY Where is she?!      Alice!   Alice! 
JOAN Who do you think you are? 
JACEY Dammit, where is she?!

JOAN Get out! 
JACEY Alice! 
JOAN Get out of here! 
JACEY Alice! 
Lloyd Abbott steps in the front door and drops his car keys into the silver bowl on the hall table. 
LLOYD Call the police, Joan. 
Joan hurries away. 
JACEY You son-of-a-bitch! Where is she?! 
LLOYD Behind you, Mr. Holt... 
Jacey turns and sees Alice standing at the top of the stairs. She is pale and drawn and wearing a bathrobe. 
JACEY Come with me. Please, Alice, just come with me now, right now. 
ALICE I told you... I can't... 
She walks OUT OF VIEW. Lloyd steps up behind Jacey and says softly but with piercing intensity: 
LLOYD Now, get out of here, you runt stud. And keep your poor-boy dick out of my daughters. 
Jacey turns and stares at Lloyd -- then brushes past him on his way out the door. 
123     INT. HOLT HOME - JACEY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY              123 
Jacey haphazardly packs his suitcases. His emotions have been spent. Helen stands in the doorway.

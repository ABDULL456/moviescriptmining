JOHN (dismayed) Miss Lindsay, you are alone!! 
DIDO I did not have the chance to see you before you left...Mr Davinier ...to convey my apologies. 
JOHN Apologies...? 
DIDO Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it...you...you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not... 
His eyes soften as he looks at her... 
JOHN He would make mine a living hell, were he to know of us speaking. DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and promenading. 
Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly! Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious. DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares panicked into his eyes and he into hers. 
61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly. 
ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter. 61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed... JOHN (CONT'D) Forgive me. She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other. 
DIDO What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier? JOHN I am under a third cousin - a solicitor, here. Nothing more than petty disputes between unsavoury landlords and debauched tenants, but I cannot discount it. DIDO Not what you wished for. JOHN I haven't given up on The Inns. Nothing worth having in life comes easily. DIDO (flushed) Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well. 
JOHN Very well...thank you. 
DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself. 
DIDO I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks. JOHN (agitated) Tis pitiful! Such inability to simply know what value to put on another's life. DIDO (bitterly) What price, a worthless Negro. 
JOHN (frustrated) You utterly misunderstand me. I am saying that no man may have the value of that of cargo!!! Human beings cannot be priced, since we are priceless!! Freemen and slaves alike! Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words. JOHN (CONT'D) (enthused) I am with others here. We are all students in law - applying pressure on the insurance companies to refuse from here on to insure slaves on any ship. A simple clause. DIDO But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but... 
JOHN A change in law - something the insurance companies can lobby for IF they can be persuaded to band together. (softly,) We may only be students, but...change is most always precipitated by the young. (shrugs - poignant) Someone has to have the courage. How can we expect to be civilised if we live in a barbaric world. His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She takes him in - he is so very handsome! 
JOHN (CONT'D) It is the utter injustice...the industrial slaughter of so many. DIDO stares at him earnestly. DIDO No. It is more than that. It's the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity. She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him. JOHN That is indeed the truth. 
Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her. DIDO I have never heard anyone speak like you. JOHN Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay. 
He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now. JOHN (CONT'D) You must return. They will be anxious. Should I follow to see you safely. 
DIDO No we cannot risk it. He nods - studies her.... JOHN Good bye, Miss Lindsay. (he pauses) I suspect, we will never see each other again. The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily. DIDO Good bye, Mr Davinier. 
She turns, preparing herself. JOHN Miss Lindsay?!! (tentative) We...commune at the Coaching Inn - Kentish Town...most evenings.. 
He trails off awkwardly. She falters. 
DIDO Quite.

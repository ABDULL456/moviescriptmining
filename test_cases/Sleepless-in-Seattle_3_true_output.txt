(he pulls the map and 
it snaps back up) 
JONAH 
She doesn't want us to go to 
Baltimore.  She wants to meet 
us in New York City on 
Valentine's Day.  On top of the 
Empire State Building. 
SAM 
Perfect.  We'll be there. 
Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his 
letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back 
to Geraldo. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous. 
He looks up and spots: 
VICTORIA 
walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves 
and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer 
from the maitre d'. 
After a beat. 
SAM 
Hi. 
VICTORIA 
Hi. 
An awkward pause. 
SAM 
You look good. 
VICTORIA 
You look good yourself. 
Another pause. 
VICTORIA 
I thought you were never going 
to call me. 
SAM 
You did? 
VICTORIA 
I really wanted you to call me, 
and I thought you were never 
going to -- 
SAM 
You could have called me -- 
VICTORIA 
No way.  No way I was going to 
be the first woman you went out 
with after... 
(she gestures 
helplessly) 
There is no percentage 
whatsoever in being the first 
woman anyone goes out with 
after... 
SAM 
You are the first woman I'm 
going out with. 
VICTORIA 
Oh. 
SAM 
So whatdya say? I'll get the 
check, and I'll call you in 
eight months. 
Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically. 
VICTORIA 
Oh, you are funny -- 
We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES. 
CUT TO: 
SEATTLE DETECTIVE 
sitting at a table across the room, having just taken 
the picture of Sam we saw frozen, with a miniature 
camera.  In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later 
photographs: 
SAM AND VICTORIA SIMPLY TALKING. 
SAM HOLDING HIS FORK ACROSS THE TABLE TO GIVE VICTORIA 
A BITE OF HIS SALMON. 
SAM AND VICTORIA SHARING A LAUGH. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE MARKET - DAY 
Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is 
walking with Det. Wheedle toward a table you stand at 
near the clam bar. 
ANNIE 
Tell me he's living in squalor. 
Tell me everything he has is 
being repossessed, including 
his filthy, dented mobile home. 
WHEEDLE 
He's got a houseboat. 
ANNIE 
I hate boats. 
WHEEDLE 
It sounds nice. 
ANNIE 
Boats.  You go out in them. 
You come back in them.  I hate 
them. 
WHEEDLE 
Houseboats don't go anywhere. 
ANNIE 
Boats.  All anyone talks about 
is the wind.  Is it up, is it 
down.  I can't live with a man 
who only talks about the wind. 
WHEEDLE 
It's not a boat boat.  It's 
really a house. 
ANNIE 
But it's on the water. 
WHEEDLE 
It's on the lake right in the 
middle of Seattle. 
(beat) 
It rains nine months of the 
year in Seattle. 
ANNIE 
I hope I don't have to pay for

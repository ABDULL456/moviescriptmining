DEALER I don't know that the fuck you just said, little kid. But you touched a brother's heart, so I'm gonna help you out with some directions to the studio. 
JAY You know where Miramax is at? 
DEALER Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for seventy-eight percent of my business. 
INT. E! ENTERTAINMENT NEWS--DAY 
After E! news logo plays. CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio. 
STEVE KMETKO Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office tells us a posting was pulled off an Internet movie chat board that was allegedly written by the two domestic terrorists themselves. It's sending a shockwave through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules? 
Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate. 
JULES ASNER Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is one of terror today, after the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office learned that hot, new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob are targeting Miramax Studios for their next campaign of blood, violence and monkey-theft. In the posting, pulled off Movie Poop Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome threatened, quote-- (reading) "Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who are making the Bluntman and Chronic movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive- Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted, then eat their Expletive-Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted that we made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we haven't been able to get a statement from anyone here are the studio. 
BACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio. 
STEVE Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are on the lot, shooting a super-secret project. Have you seen then roaming around? 
BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios. 
JULES No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck buying a soda at a concession stand earlier. 
STEVE But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob? 
JULES None whatsoever. However, to be fair, all the feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly. For all we know, they could already be on the lot. 
As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera and start waving behind Jules. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY 
Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops out of her seat. 
JUSTICE Oh my God! Jay! No! 
Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on-- 
The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table. 
Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks for a beat, then-- 
JUSTICE Fuck it. 
She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in her pocket. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY 
The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning. Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity. Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads: SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM. 
EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY 
The convertible skids out, taking off. 
INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY 
There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap). Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note. 
SISSY That bitch!  That fucking, fucking bitch!!! (to girls) Get dressed. We're going after her. 
CHRISSY Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet. 
SISSY Which is more important to you: a fortune in diamonds or busting a nut? 
Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties. 
SISSY (O.S.) Chrissy! Now! 
CHRISSY Fuck-- 
Chrissy races back up the stairs. 
EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY 
The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob. 
JAY We gotta play this right. 
Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle and giving chase.

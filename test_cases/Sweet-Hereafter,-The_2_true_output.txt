NICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride.  A school bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.  NICOLE watches as the driver tries to form them into a group. 
NICOLE What's going to happen to Dolores? 
SAM I don't know. 
NICOLE Will the police do anything to her? 
SAM It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off. 
NICOLE She'll move away. 
SAM There's talk of that. 
NICOLE Someplace where no one knows her. (beat) Someplace strange and new. 
SAM is frozen.  NICOLE smiles to herself. 
CUT TO 
EXT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING 
At the airport, in the arrivals bay, MITCHELL waits for his limousine. 
Across the road, a hotel minibus is parked.  The driver is DOLORES.  The camera settles on her face as she stares at MITCHELL. 
MITCHELL catches her gaze, and the two stare at each other. 
NICOLE (voice over) As you see each other, almost two years later, I wonder if you realize something. 
MITCHELL'S limo arrives.  He gets inside. 
CUT TO 
INT. LIMOUSINE -- MORNING 
CLOSE-UP of MITCHELL as he stares ahead, lost in thought. 
NICOLE (voice over) I wonder if you realize that all of us - Dolores, me, the children who survived, the children who didn't - that we're all citizens of a different town now. 
CUT TO 
EXT. GAS STATION -- DAY 
BILLY watches as a crane lifts the demolished schoolbus onto a flatbed truck. 
NICOLE (voice over) A town of people living in the sweet hereafter. 
CUT TO 
EXT. CAR -- AFTERNOON 
NICOLE and SAM driving home from the fairground. 
NICOLE (voice over) Whether others defend us, protect us, love us or hate us - they do it to meet their own needs, not ours. 
The camera leaves the car to look up at the sky. 
CUT TO 
EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DUSK 
Sunday night at the fairground.  NICOLE is staring at the ferris wheel.  In her imagination, the swinging cars of the 
slowly turning wheel are full of children.  The laughter and noise is haunting. 
NICOLE smiles as she stares at this private apparition. 
NICOLE (voice over) This is what I learned.  This is what I found out.

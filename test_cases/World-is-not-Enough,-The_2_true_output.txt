ELEKTRA (to M) I have a gift for you.  Something that belonged to my father. He would have wanted you to have it. 
M feels uneasy. 
M Perhaps this isn't the time... 
ELEKTRA Please. 
She hands M a small box.  M unties the ribbon. 
ELEKTRA He often spoke of how...compassionately you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping. 
M opens the box.  It is THE EYE OF THE GLENS...the heirloom pin, the original. 
ELEKTRA It's very valuable, you know. I just couldn't let it explode with the rest of him. 
M looks up, horrified, when: 
GABOR AND ANOTHER SECURITY MAN SHOOT M'S TWO GUARDS IN THE HEAD...point blank, cold blood.  The men fall. 
M looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare. 
ELEKTRA (to her men) Take her to the chopper. 
EXT. PIPELINE - DAY 
From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER.  Beyond, the pipeline continues unperturbed. 
Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater. 
CLOSE ON THEM 
Bond and Christmas, very much alive.  She's angry. 
CHRISTMAS What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us! 
BOND I did kill us. She thinks we're dead. And she thinks she got away with it. 
CHRISTMAS What the hell are you talking about? 
BOND It's part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium. 
CHRISTMAS Who's she? 
BOND Elektra King. 
CHRISTMAS Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline. 
BOND Makes her look even more innocent. 
CHRISTMAS (skeptical) What would she want with weapons grade plutonium? 
BOND I was hoping you could tell me. 
Christmas stares at him.  Wheels turning. 
CHRISTMAS You steal an old bomb, small by today's standards, about the size of the one that destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium core out of it, intending to use it... (beat) To make a bigger, better bomb. 
They're both chilled by the thought. 
CHRISTMAS I have to get after that core.  This is my ass. 
She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a CRACKLE. 
TANNER Tanner to 007, do you read? 
Bond grabs the radio. 
BOND Loud and clear.  I have to speak to M. 
TANNER She's gone. 
BOND What? 
TANNER She's disappeared.  And two of our men have been killed. 
It impacts on Bond.  His eyes harden. 
CHRISTMAS What is it? 
BOND She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M's life is part of the bet. 
He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly snake with the world for its bed. 
BOND I know I promised you champagne, but would you settle for caviar? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - ISTANBUL - TWILIGHT 
A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus). 
Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden with bags and cases.  They enter the tower... 
INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS 
A fantastic space:  stained glass windows cast myriad patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces.  Pillars, iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge room. 
As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into Renard's arms.  He holds her.  She pushes him away.

A silence.    Maceo is moved by the scene- 
MACEO Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it. 
Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand, distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left, nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat- 
TY Mace, Imonna lose my club. 
MACEO Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that- 
TY I got no more cards to play- 
MACEO Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person- 
TY (angry) I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed- 
WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at the contents- 
TY What the hell that sposed to be? 
Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it- 
MACEO Some kind of guitar. 
TY A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs. 
China Doll rushes in, upset- 
CHINA DOLL They gone and arrest him! 
TY Arrested who? 
CHINA DOLL Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin. 
TY Who's Sonny? 
CHINA DOLL Sonny that was here yesterday morning. 
TY Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that- 
Maceo plucks a string.    Not much of a sound- 
MACEO It's electric- 
TY I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make. 
MACEO Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out- 
He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires, also home-modified- 
MACEO -your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be. 
CHINA DOLL Sonny said he fix radios in the Army. 
TY Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway? 
CHINA DOLL Daddy- 
TY Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs- 
MACEO A sideman- 
TY Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies- 
MACEO Old time music- 
CHINA DOLL Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work. 
MACEO They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up. 
CHINA DOLL But he doesn't belong there! 
Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands- 
MACEO You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal. 
TY I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!

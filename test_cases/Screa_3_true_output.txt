Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big, line backer of a guy, her boyfriend... 
STEVE 
tied and gagged.  He's been roughed up, but he's alive. CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend, pleading with her. 
CASEY Oh Goddddd... 
Casey SCREAMS.  Her hand moves to the lock on the door. 
MAN I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
Terror rides Casey's face.  She's petrified. 
CASEY Where are you? 
MAN Guess. 
Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.  He could be anywhere-anywhere. 
CASEY (begging) Please don't hurt him. 
MAN That all depends on you. 
CASEY Why are you doing this? 
Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face. 
MAN I wanna play a game. 
CASEY No... 
MAN Then he dies. Right now. 
CASEY NOOO! 
MAN Which is it? 
A long silence.  Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this big jock of a guy is crying too. 
CASEY What kind of game? 
MAN Turn off the light. 
Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears... 
CLICK 
He disappears in the darkness.  Casey moves away from the glass, back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified. 
MAN Here's how we play. I ask a question. If you get it right-Steve lives. 
Three curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening the room.  Her body quivers. 
CASEY Please don't do this... 
MAN Come on. It'll be fun. 
CASEY No...please. 
MAN It's an easy category. Movie trivia. 
CASEY (begging) ..please... 
MAN I'll even give you a warm up question. 
CASEY Don't do this. I can't.. 
MAN Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. 
CASEY No... 
MAN Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters. 
Casey goes silent...a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much less think. 
CASEY I don't know... 
MAN Come on, yes you do. 
CASEY Please..stop... 
Casey is SOBBING. 
MAN What's his name? 
CASEY I can't think. 
Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all reality. 
MAN Steve's counting on you.

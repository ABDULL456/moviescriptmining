HAWK On your marks and... 
Trip and Lex ready themselves, then... 
HAWK Fire! 
They start stomping on the packets, squirting Elvis's face and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to let out a scream that lasts the rest of the scene. Ketchup spatters across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream. 
The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms back, body quaking at every splat. It's kind of like the scene in "The Godfather" where Sonny gets it. 
Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GASPING, Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. He hits the floor with a THUD right in the goop. He lays there letting out DRY SOBS looking like a bunless wiener. 
Hawk jumps off the stoop. Taking Elvis's key chain away, he hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out. Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head, then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile. 
HAWK Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog. 
Hawk bolts out the door. Elvis tries to get up only to slip in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard. 
ELVIS Nooooo!! 
JAILBREAK 
EXT. STREET IN THE NEXT COUNTY - DAY 
C/U on the grill of a moving car, Ohio vanity plate reading: Ob-GYN. 
PULL BACK to reveal it's on a brand spanking-new, brown Volvo 242 DL hauling ass. Hawk drives, Lex rides shotgun, and Trip sits in the back, arms draped over the front seat. 
EXT. ST. BERNARD'S - DAY 
The Volvo turns and barrels up St. Bernard's gated entrance. 
INT. VOLVO - DAY 
TRIP Well, here we are back at fucking school again. 
LEX Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine. 
Hawk and Trip roll their eyes. 
INT. ST. BERNARD'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY 
Mrs. Bruce and FATHER McNULTY stand outside his office. The door is open a tad. Jam sits just beyond it, but all we see are his corduroyed legs which shake. Jam is one nervous kid. 
MRS. BRUCE Again, many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice. 
Father McNulty has a look of utter compassion on his face. 
FATHER MCNULTY Anything for a potential tuition... to be given to charity of course. 
MRS. BRUCE God bless you, Father McNulty. 
FATHER MCNULTY He already has. 
They hug. She exits. And the look of utter compassion on Father McNulty's face disappears. 
INT. FATHER MCNULTY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The priest enters, SLAMS the door shut, startling Jam, and sits in front of a painting of the Virgin Mary on his wall. The name plate on his desk reads: FR. PHILIP McNULTY. 
FATHER MCNULTY Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at St. Bernard's was an uneventful one. Some students believe they can get expelled through disobedience and recklessness. What they don't understand is even after God's vengeance is meted out, He forgives. That His devastating anger is followed by His nurturing compassion. In a nutshell, St. Bernard's may punish you even for the slightest digression, but will never cast you out, even for the largest. So here you are, Jeremiah... here to stay! 
Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil sharpener and it makes the same NOISE a DENTIST'S DRILL does when burrowing into a molar. Jam shudders. 
The Father removes the pencil and blows the shavings away from the needle-sharp tip. 
FATHER MCNULTY Let's begin the enrollment, shall we? 
EXT. ST. BERNARD'S - DAY 
Mrs. Bruce exits the building and approaches her car. She stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her. It's empty. She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off. 
Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up. The coast is clear so they can sit straight again. They stare up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's profile. 
LEX Now, how are we gonna do this? 
HAWK Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.

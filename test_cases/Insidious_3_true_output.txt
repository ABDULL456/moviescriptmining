INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
A long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is dark here. 
Josh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life. 
The colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness. 
Josh keeps moving down the corridor. 
Up ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall, ignoring Josh. 
He presses forward, following the figure. 
JOSH Dalton? 
He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table. 
His footsteps have no sound as he continues on. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton? 
He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open. 
INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage. 
A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a child being punished at school. 
Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step. 
JOSH Where is Dalton? 
He steps closer yet again. 
His hand reaches out to touch the figures back... 
...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder. 
Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the source. 
When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE. 
He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of the room. 
INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish, dream-like. 
Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left. 
SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN. 
The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit. 
JOSH Do you know where Dalton is? 
The man doesn't acknowledge him. 
MAN Why do I have to put up with you? What a tramp. You call this a home? I work all day for this? 
He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone. 
Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs. The stairs descend into darkness. 
Josh squints into the dark, afraid. 
JOSH Dalton? Where are you? 
The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to walk away. A distant voice stops him. 
DALTON (O.S.) Dad... 
Josh SNAPS back. 
The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of the stairs. 
Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it. 
INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell. 
Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another corridor of this labyrinth.

KATES O.K. (signs document) Cragie, you'll be assigned to headquarters until the hearing -- 
CRAGIE Hearing? Who called for a hearing? The little fuck tried to shoot me in the back! 
Eddie enters. Kates looks up from his desk. 
KATES Ms. Partida -- 
CRAGIE That piece of shit! 
KATES Shut-up, Cragie. (pause) Partida has demanded a formal hearing. You will be under oath so the department will provide you with a lawyer unless you've got your own. (stands) An OPS Review Board member is waiting to talk to you. Doesn't sound like you got anything to worry about. 
Cragie gets up. Kosalas, sitting through this interview in stunned silence stands also. 
KATES Kosalas, you work with Cusack until this is over. 
KOSALAS Yes sir. 
Kosalas and Cragie exit. 
EDDIE I ain't got no time to nursmaid a rookie. I don't need a partner. 
KATES (explodes) Your right! You don't need a partner! You need a goddamn keeper! (slams fist on desk) Jesus Christ! How do I explain this one upstairs? (stands) We gave you 600 man-hours, you took a month planning the damn thing, and what have you got to show for it? Nine bodies? A dead informant? One of my best men shot! For Christ's sake! (stares at ceiling) You're going to have me back on a beat busting perverts in the park. 
Kates sits, sighs, suddenly tired. 
EDDIE We got a bigger problem. These Comachos aren't gonna take this lying down. The animals are out of the cages. 
KATES Just what I need. A goddman war. 
Eddie turns to leave. 
KATES Keep track of this business with Cragie? 
EDDIE Yeah. 
The PHONE RINGS. 
KATES I'll deal with upstairs. 
Eddie starts to leave again. Kates picks up the phone, and puts a hand over the mouthpiece. 
KATES Just get me some answers, huh. 
EDDIE That's my job. 
Eddie exits. 
INT. HEADQUARTERS OFFICE - DAY 
Kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. A court stenographer is silently typing. 
PARTIDA ...you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney present at all times. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law... 
INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY 
Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers start moving. 
Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now he can't get the door to stay closed. 
EDDIE I'm going to have to fix that. 
Eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane passing directly overhead. 
Eddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable.

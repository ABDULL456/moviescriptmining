Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange. 
ALEX You're kidding me. 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                98. 
NATALIE 
is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full- out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other cheerleaders. She's better. 
ON THE COURT 
The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another agenda as well... 
COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER The time out is over, but one cheerleader doesn't seem to notice. Officials can't start the clock again while she's on the court. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS 
Dylan has picked two wires. 
DYLAN Chartreuse and magenta.   This has gotta be it. 
She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when... 
KNOX (O.S.) I wouldn't do that, if I were you. 
She spins to see Knox, standing behind her. 
KNOX (CONT'D) See, if you snip ANY of those wires, the bomb WILL blow up. 
DYLAN It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero. 
KNOX Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential? 
He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene. 
KNOX (CONT'D) THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So if you'll kindly step away, I'll refrain from killing both of us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                             99. 
CONTINUED: Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away. 
KNOX (CONT'D) In different circumstances, Dylan, I think you and I could have worked out. We have a lot in common. 
DYLAN Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one. 
Knox laughs. 
KNOX Good one. (beat, as he backs up) Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same. 
Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way. 
ALEX Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded. 
NATALIE Give us the detonator. 
KNOX NO! 
Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high. 
KNOX (CONT'D) I'll blow this building sky high, I swear! 
CHARLIE (O.S.) Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want, not all these innocent people. 
Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows. 
KNOX Charlie? 
That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing. 
He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a "We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance. 
ANGELS Charlie? 
Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 100. 
CONTINUED: 
CHARLIE Your father was a double agent, Eric. Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail. (beat) He was my friend. 
KNOX It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father! 
CHARLIE Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric. 
Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target. 
It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching Knox decide Charlie's fate. 
Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined. He starts lowering his gun. 
KNOX Okay.  You're right. (quickly) I'll just kill you.

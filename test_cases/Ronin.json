Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes. \nSAM Check this out. (he's thinking on his feet) Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think... \nDEIRDRE (finishing his sentence) That we're too stupid to trace his calls. \nDeirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they might still win this one. \nEXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT \nWe're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France: the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix. \nOutdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING, DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits, sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet. Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which drives off as we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEEP - SAME TIME \nGregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down the length of the Cours Mirabeau. \nGREGOR (breaking the silence) It's a beautiful street, no? \nThe Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident of what used to be called the Soviet Union. \nDAPPER GENT (he can't wait any longer) Do you have it? \nGREGOR Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything. \nDAPPER GENT This is important. \nGREGOR Do you really think so? \nDAPPER GENT You know it is. \nGregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece. \nGREGOR Relax! \nThe Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat. Gregor pulls the van to a curb. \nGREGOR Look over there. \nGREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF CHILDREN are playing. \nGREGOR (O.S.) Do you see that one?  The girl in the light blue dress? \nWe find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his silenced pistol, as if to shoot her. \nDAPPER GENT What are you doing, have you lost your mind?!? \nGregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing. BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent hadn't ruined his aim. \nDAPPER GENT Why did you do that? \nGREGOR To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk. (giving the Gent a look) I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything... \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nEXT. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT \nA FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass. A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to side.  Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE THROUGH TO - \nINT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME \nDAPPER GENT (squirming) Enough!  We've been driving for an hour, where is my package? \nGregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.  He pulls the jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent. \nGREGOR It's under your seat. \nDAPPER GENT (incredulous) What? \nGREGOR As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat. \nThe Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat. \nDAPPER GENT I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I thought I trained you better than that. \nWith a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor, whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward. He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is - COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like a prince for quite some time.  Gregor sucks in an involuntary breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't reached for the Briefcase.  Instead he's taken out his gun, and it's only inches from Gregor's head. \nDAPPER GENT I've never particularly liked you either, Gregor. \nThe Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does - \nTHE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still attached by the handcuff chain.  The Hand flies up in the Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound of another silenced shot as we - \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME \nA DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of the jeep.  Seconds later - The door swings open, and the Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.  A moment later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of the Gent as the jeep drives off.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out around his head.  Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES. And not just any phone... \nINT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME \nGregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  We hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is picked up. \nPHONE VOICE (V.O.) (in Russian, English subtitles) Is it done? \nGREGOR (in English) It's done. \nBEAT.  The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.  The Voice switches to English. \nPHONE VOICE (V.O.) Gregor, is that you? \nGREGOR (with a low chuckle) Much to your disappointment, no doubt. \nPHONE VOICE (V.O.) It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened. \nGREGOR (suddenly cold, furious) I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! \nBEAT. \nPHONE VOICE (V.O.) So what do we do? \nGREGOR What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do. \nThe Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN \nLarry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping bag on the floor.  Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.  Suddenly - Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in the room.  He looks around - No Sam.  Vincent gets up, takes out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.  He moves down a long hall and - No Sam.  Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into - \n", "test1_id": 2229, "test2_input": "SAM What's the story? \nTONY It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners. \nVINCENT Do you have the tape? \nTONY I might know where you could get a copy. \nThe Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with him. \nTONY (to Vincent and Sam) Let me do some business with my boy here, and I'll meet you across the street in five.  I gotta make homes here feel like he's getting a good deal while I give him the pleasure of overpaying me for a couple of second generation pirates. \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nThe Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the street towards - \nINT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT \nA HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end. We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and Sam. \nTONY (his mouth full) What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix. \nVINCENT You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape? \nTONY All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version. \nSAM (instantly) Gaelic. \nTONY You sure? \nSAM I'm sure. \nVINCENT (to Tony) Can you get it? \nTONY The Russian would be easier. \nSAM Why's that? \nTONY Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find. \nSAM It's the Irish tape we want. \nTONY (with a sigh) Gonna be tough. \nTony scribbles something on a piece of paper. \nTONY Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly. \nSAM (repeating it, he knows this name) Seamus Reilly. \nVINCENT (to Sam) You know him? \nSAM I know of him. \nTONY Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying. \nVINCENT I get the picture. \nSam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand on top of it. \nVINCENT Tony and I have to talk some business, first. \nTONY I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle. \nVINCENT It's a matter of respect. (to Sam) Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long. \nSam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent are now discussing the price of the information.  They are both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying themselves immensely. \n", "test2_true": "Vincent exits the shop and gets into - \nINT.

A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. (quick beat) You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer. \nLONG BEAT.  Sam considers what to say, and then decides he owes Vincent the truth. \nSAM I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops. \nVINCENT Dark ops? \nSAM Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination. \nVINCENT Very ugly. \nSAM It is at that. \nVINCENT Not very zen of you, huh?

The passenger seat next to her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror, which reveals - \nA glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge. \nDEIRDRE You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. \nSEAMUS (a hideous laugh) Plastic fucking surgeon? (indicates his face) You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. \nDEIRDRE You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... \nSEAMUS (losing it) Shut up!!! (he puts a gun to her head) Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!? \nBEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing. \nSEAMUS Do I need to repeat myself? \nDEIRDRE No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME \nTHE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does - \nA LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT \nTHE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN. Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like \"Da!\" and \"Nyet!\" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front, because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress - \nA WOODS - \nA forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam. Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit. They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands. \nSAM Not here.  They might see it. \nVINCENT If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. (takes the cigarettes back and lights one) Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing. \nVincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of his head. \nSAM Time to quit. \nVINCENT Just like that? \nSAM Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette. \n", "test3_true": "SAM (he hates this) Would you stop with that... \nVINCENT Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... (quick beat) And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that. \nSAM (qith a cynical laugh) The mark of a true Samurai. (seriously) What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job. \nVINCENT Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for. \nSAM Because I don't walk away. \nVINCENT Why not? \nSAM It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. (beat) Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not? \nVINCENT Closest and oldest. \nSAM And yet you would have killed him to save my life. (quick beat) You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job. \nVINCENT And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it? \nSAM That's a good question. \nVINCENT Do you have a good answer? \nSAM (he's really just considering this) No, I don't. \nINT. THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE \nARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon squad. \nMOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture. Each room could be a museum, as we move through - \nA GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters - \nA PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which is two hundred years old - \nA BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light of an exquisite chandelier - \nA KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal you've ever seen.  Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries it out to - \nA DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and yet the table is occupied by only one man - \nMIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.  Now - \nThe Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table. \nEXT. THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT \nA TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out. Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase. Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DINING ROOM/CHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER \nMikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered into the room.  THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching to see what Mikhi wants.  Now - \nMikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone with the gangster.  Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as he motions for Gregor to sit. \nMIKHI (in Russian, English subtitles) Sit, sit... (offering a cigarette) Would you like one? \nGREGOR (in English) No, Mikhi, I wouldn't. (letting that sink in for a minute) Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely. \nMIKHI (makes no never mind to him) Whatever you wish... (lights his own cigarette) This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you. \nGREGOR Edvard said the same thing about you before he died. \nMIKHI I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him. \n", "test3_id": 2231}

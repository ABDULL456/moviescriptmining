{"train": "\"Ronin\", early, by J.D. Zeik \nRONIN \nan original screenplay by \nJ.D. Zeik \nDRAFT: May 20, 1997 \nA BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly, but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan, the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai, they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin. The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft... \nFADE IN ON: \nINT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT \nIt's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin, then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find - A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is. FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame, silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The Killer shows them the Briefcase. \nKILLER God loves me. \nTHE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead. The Killer raises his silenced pistol. \nKILLER (to his victim) But I don't think he's too fond of you... \nSLAM CUT TO: \nEXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT \nA PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot we expected to hear. \nRain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of streetlight. \nEXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET \nThe source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY AMERICAN. \nUGLY AMERICAN (V.O.) What is this? \nCUT TO: \nINT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT \nA SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the bar in this smokey, dim dive. \nUGLY AMERICAN (O.S.) This is not football... \nAnd now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off screen. \nUGLY AMERICAN (O.S.) (continuing) ...Football is three hundred pound guys, they run way too fucking fast, they got helmets made of kevlar they use to spear the quarterback into the next life. \nSLAM CUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE \nThe phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and even as we drink this in we're back in - \nINT. THE BAR \nAT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble. He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks solid. \nLARRY (talking to the air) You wanna know what football is?  It's hitting the other guy dirty and then spitting in his face when he's down. Football is all things American, and American is A-Number-One the absolute fucking best there is.  That's what football is... (he points to the TV) ...And that's not football. \nThe one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French, hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then speaks - \nVINCENT (to Larry in perfect English) Football -- American football -- is a game for faggots. \nA BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark. Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a confrontation as we go back to - \nVINCENT (lighting his cigarette) The question isn't what we're waiting for... it's who. \nLARRY And who the fuck is that? \nGREGOR Whoever hired us. \nSAM I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money... \nThere's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men were hired the same way. \nSAM (continuing his thought) So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people. \nGREGOR Now that is an interesting proposition. \nSWEDE How so? \nGREGOR Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides. (with great meaning) Your orders might be different from mine. \nLARRY What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand. \nSWEDE (quietly, but loud enough to be heard) What a surprise... \nLARRY I got a surprise for you, blondie... \nGREGOR (sharply, as if he's used to giving orders) Why don't both of you shut up? \nLARRY & SWEDE (to Gregor at the same time) Fuck you! \nSAM Knock it off! \nThere is a BEAT.  Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a kind of mutual respect. \nSAM The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us... (looks around the table) Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of... (finding the right word) ...unpleasantness. \nLARRY (patting the gun inside his cheap suit) Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes. \nFrom OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.  ANOTHER ANGLE - \nDeirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last exchange. \nDEIRDRE It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking. \nLARRY Who the fuck are you? \nDEIRDRE (staring at Larry) The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show. \nGREGOR Who are you?  IRA? \nDEIRDRE (with a brittle laugh) Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other. \nDeirdre hands out several thick envelopes.  Larry and Swede open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look. \nDEIRDRE From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. (a quick beat, then she looks at Gregor) You.  What do you do and what should we call you? \nGREGOR These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs. \nDeirdre turns to Sam. \nSAM Sam.  I'm a weapons guy. \nDEIRDRE You were a soldier, were you? \nSAM Once. \nDeirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.  Finally, Deirdre turns to Larry. \nLARRY I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States. \nGREGOR I'd stake my reputation. \nDEIRDRE But would you stake your life, that's the question... \nGREGOR In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same. \nFrom off screen we hear MUNCHING.  It's - Larry inhaling a sandwich.  A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry. \nSWEDE You should watch what you eat. \nLARRY Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar? \nSWEDE I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds. \nLARRY (sensitive about his weight) And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck? \nSWEDE (sensitive about the dumb blonde thing) Who you calling dumb, dickless? \nBoth men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping him to the floor.  Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to the ground. \nDEIRDRE (standing above them) Next one of you fuckers plays this game I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't say it again: we don't have time for this shit!  There's a clock running on this job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on schedule. \nA TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys -- letting them know who's in charge.  A SOUND from OFF SCREEN interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent, who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat. \nHe's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling men, and then at - Deirdre.  She gives Vincent a little nod -- a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam. \nVINCENT Let's go for a ride. \nVincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground. \nSAM Where to? \nVINCENT To see a man about a thing. \nSAM I can do that. \nEXT. THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET \nA DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS. \nTHE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new. Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.  The LEADER of the Toughs apporaches Vincent. \nLEADER (subtitled French) Who gave you permission to park here? \nSAM (to Vincent) What's he saying? \nVINCENT Pretty much what you'd expect. \nSAM (with a sigh) That's what I thought. \nLEADER (in French) There's a charge for parking on our block. \nThe other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French, of course). \nVINCENT (to Sam) He says this is their block. \nSAM As in, they own it? \nVINCENT Something like that... \nSAM And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh? \nVINCENT I didn't know that you spoke French. \nSAM I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal. \nANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam. Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is speaking the universal language of \"give me some money or I'll kick your ass.\" \nSAM Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is. \nVINCENT So is the woman. \nSAM Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous. \nVINCENT I wonder if she truly left the IRA. \nSAM I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though... (suddenly direct) Why bring me? \nVINCENT I wanted to see who you were. \nSAM Who am I? \nVincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance before speaking. \nVINCENT You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. (beat) Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around. \nSAM That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this. \nVINCENT They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something. \nSAM Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless. \nAnd on that thought we - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nThe Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out. Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to - \nAN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere. When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath. \nVINCENT Lovely, isn't it? \nSAM They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up. \nThe two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. \nFRANCOIS That's good right where you are, Vincent. \nVincent signals for Sam to stop.  Both Vincent and Sam are still several feet away from Francois. \nVINCENT Do you have it? \nFRANCOIS Not so fast. (nods slightly to Sam) Who's that? \nVINCENT He's company. \nFRANCOIS (as if he recognizes Sam) Bad company... \nVINCENT What do you mean? \nFRANCOIS He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now! \nSam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which Francois spoke.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it turns out) Francois speaks fairly well. \nSAM (to Vincent) What's going on? \nVINCENT I just wanted to see something. \nSAM (that edge creeping into his voice) See what? \nVincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois chimes in. \nFRANCOIS He wanted to see how you reacted when I said that you were a cop. \nEXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER/NIGHT \nVincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this apartment house.  Vincent and Sam exit the car and move towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.  He thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam. \nVINCENT You saved my life back there in the park. I know this doesn't begin to make it right between us... \nVincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say. Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for himself, the other he gives to Vincent. \nSAM What I did back in the park I did because we're working together -- we're on the same team. (holding up the money) This is business -- this is work.  We did it together, we share the spoils, even split. \nSam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last thing to say to him. \nVINCENT I owe you a heavy debt. \nSam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't seem to be something he believes in. \nSAM Whatever you say. \nThey enter the house and the door closes behind them.  A second later we hear - \nDEIRDRE (V.O.) What'd you do with the money? \nINT. THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nVincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.  They've told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about all of this. \nVINCENT We kept it... \nDEIRDRE (a little annoyed) Is that right? \nSAM Hazard pay... \nDEIRDRE (with an exhalation of disgust) The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war... \nSAM We weren't real thrilled about it either... \nDeirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.  We FOLLOW HER INTO - \nAN ADJOINING ROOM - \nWhere Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.  They look up expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events. \nLARRY So what's the deal? \nDEIRDRE (barely stopping, very snappish) The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light. \nAnd she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.  larry looks at the two of them. \nLARRY What'd you guys do? \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nA CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind a window on the third floor.  Sam's room. \nINT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nSam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more, and then retracts his leg. \nDEIRDRE I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that? \nSAM I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed. \nDEIRDRE I still am. \nSAM Is that right? \nDEIRDRE That's right. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake -- looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance. \nDEIRDRE Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again. \nSAM You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre. \nDEIRDRE (almost surprised by this) I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a - (almost with a sneer) Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. (a quick beat) Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  \"Send the girl to do it.\"  \"Tell The girl to take care of it.\"  \"Have the girl fuck him.\" (a quick beat) But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less. \nSAM You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me. \nDEIRDRE Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me. \nSomewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam. They're lips brush and - \nA MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A QUICK BEAT, then - \nDEIRDRE I better be getting that. \nSAM Duty calls? \nDEIRDRE (with a trace of a sigh) Just business. \nDeirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits us in the eyes as we find ourselves above - \nEXT. NICE - DAY \nA DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to MOVE DOWN TOWARDS - \nEXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE \nA TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays, sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER. Nearby - \nAT A ROUND TABLE - \nA nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse, still eating. \nDEIRDRE Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? (to Gregor) What's your job? \nGREGOR I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you. \nDEIRDRE (to Larry) Next. \nLARRY (a sigh, he's done this too many times) You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road. \nDEIRDRE (to Swede) Which leads us to... \nSWEDE I ride with fat-boy... \nLARRY (under his breath) Eat shit and die slowly... \nSWEDE After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard. \nLARRY I blast the lead car into oblivion... \nVINCENT (picking up) While Sam and I take out the back two cars... \nDEIRDRE Leaving... \nSWEDE (picking it up) ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target in the back seat, and get the package... \nDEIRDRE (with a quick look at Sam) While... \nSAM (returning her look) ...While I back him up, making sure to get the package if something goes wrong and somebody takes Swede down. \nNobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we should -- if only to note that there's something about the way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the flow of the dialogue. \nSWEDE Nobody's taking me anywhere... \nLARRY I never did trust that blonde fuck... \nDEIRDRE That's why you were riding with him. \nVINCENT The question still remains: what do we do now? \nSAM (he figures something out) Gregor's cell phone... \nLARRY (to himself) What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit? \nSAM (ignoring Larry, to Deirdre) Did he bring that with him? \nDEIRDRE I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes. \nSAM Check this out. (he's thinking on his feet) Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think... \nDEIRDRE (finishing his sentence) That we're too stupid to trace his calls. \nDeirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they might still win this one. \nEXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT \nWe're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France: the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix. \nOutdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING, DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits, sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet. Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which drives off as we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEEP - SAME TIME \nGregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down the length of the Cours Mirabeau. \nGREGOR (breaking the silence) It's a beautiful street, no? \nThe Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident of what used to be called the Soviet Union. \nDAPPER GENT (he can't wait any longer) Do you have it? \nGREGOR Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything. \nDAPPER GENT This is important. \nGREGOR Do you really think so? \nDAPPER GENT You know it is. \nGregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece. \nGREGOR Relax! \nThe Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat. Gregor pulls the van to a curb. \nGREGOR Look over there. \nGREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF CHILDREN are playing. \nGREGOR (O.S.) Do you see that one?  The girl in the light blue dress? \nWe find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his silenced pistol, as if to shoot her. \nDAPPER GENT What are you doing, have you lost your mind?!? \nGregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing. BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent hadn't ruined his aim. \nDAPPER GENT Why did you do that? \nGREGOR To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk. (giving the Gent a look) I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything... \nTHE BATHROOM: pitch black.  He moves in, swipes the string of the overhead light and - nothing.  Nobody's here.  The only place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.  He opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into - \nINT. THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME \nThis is a small building.  There is no other apartment on the floor.  At the far end of the landing, there is a small ladder which leads up to - \nTHE ROOF.  And the door which leads to the roof is flapping in a light wind. \nEXT. THE ROOF - SAME TIME \nVincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at Vincent.  A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that they know when it's safe to relax. \nSAM What's going on? \nVINCENT You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. (off Sam's look) This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... (a quick beat) Including you... \nIn answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and tosses them back to him.  Vincent looks almost delighted at this. \nSAM I came up here to sneak a smoke. \nVINCENT You were smoking? \nSAM I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table. \nVINCENT (very sincere, offering the pack) Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like. \nSam considers for a minute, and then takes one.  Vincent does so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent. \nSAM (a shrug of the shoulders) I borrowed that, too... \nVINCENT (puffing contentedly) Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself. \nSAM I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own. \nBEAT.  The two men smoke in silence, looking out at - \nTHE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE - \nWhich glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais. \nVINCENT (O.S.) That was a bad bit of business, today. \nBACK ON Sam and Vincent. \nSAM It was at that. \nVINCENT A lot of people died. \nSAM I've seen a lot of people die before. \nVINCENT I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it? \nSAM You don't.  You just learn to live with it. \nVINCENT I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't. \nSAM We live in a singular world, my friend. \nVINCENT I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. (off his look) I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun. \nSAM You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits. \nThis conversation might have gone further, but it is interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof. \nDEIRDRE Christ, I was starting to think that the two of you had thrown it in and walked away. (to Vincent) There's someone on the phone downstairs asking for you, and my somewhat limited French leads me to believe that he might have something to tell us about Gregor. \nEXT. THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT \nCUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - \nWho has finished his phone call and returned to join them. \nVINCENT ...but we've got to get back on the road. \nVincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head -- Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.  All eyes are on Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news. \nVINCENT We've got him. \nLARRY I'm driving. \nEXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY \nGregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music, have entered the Square -- everything about these guys screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is, but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one of the Gunmen goes to pick it up. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE \nThe Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising the streets, looking for Gregor. \nINT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME \nVincent stares out of the window and sees something that causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's - \nThe Gunmen walking down the street. \nVINCENT I know those men. \nSam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction, but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for - \nEXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE \nTHE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang back and then separate from the crowd. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME \nTHE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam stays behind for a second to say something to Larry. \nSAM Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when your partners come back out, you make sure you're here with the motor running. \nAnd on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre. Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them. He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand, barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE \nThe Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum- like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group, standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find - \nAN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice come at them from out of the dark. \nGREGOR (V.O.) Thank you, gentleman, that will do nicely. \nIN THE HALL - \nON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see - THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES, and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can see his quarry, but they can't see him. \nGREGOR Edvard, is that you? \nEDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen responds. \nEDVARD Yes, Gregor, they sent me. \nGREGOR I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice. \nEDVARD That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it. \nGREGOR I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem. \nDEIRDRE I guess you don't know me, then, if you think I won't kill you for an insult like that! \nSeamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at him until he starts to laugh. \nSEAMUS Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I had to do it. \nDeirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun. \nDEIRDRE Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when we get home, I don't play \"the girl\" again. \nDeirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is clear and we - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT \nThe Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get out.  Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN- PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly. \nVINCENT Hello, Jean-Pierre. \nJEAN-PIERRE Hello, my friend. (with a look at Sam) He doesn't look French to me, Vincent. \nSAM American. \nJEAN-PIERRE Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you? \nINT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATER/NIGHT \nSURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth. Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and needles.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre, who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound. Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating himself. \nVINCENT (to Sam) It's right there, beneath the surface.  I can just make it out. \nSam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this next procedure. \nJEAN-PIERRE Are you sure you won't have a drink? \nSAM (sharply) No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. (quick beat) Alright, let's do it. \nDuring this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where he's watching. \nSAM Douse the wound with alcohol. \nVincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his central nervous system. \nSAM (to Jean-Pierre) Take that sponge and wipe away as much of the blood as you can, keep it clean so I can see. \nJean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean- Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge. \nSAM (to Vincent) Take the clamp... \nVincent picks up the clamp. \nSAM Peel back the skin and attach the clamp. \nVincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.  Finally Vincent is done. \nVINCENT Alright, it's done. \nSAM You see the bullet? \nVINCENT Clearly. \nSAM Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out. \nVincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the clamp was attached. \nSeveral times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain. Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a single tug, Vincent extracts it. \nJEAN-PIERRE Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you. \nA QUICK CUT TO: \nINSIDE THE FARMHOUSE \nWhere Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from outside. \nSAM (O.S.) Vincent doesn't owe me a thing. \nVincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards the sound of the voices. \nJEAN-PIERRE (O.S.) He sees this differently, as you well know. \nSAM (O.S.) I didn't expect that he would. \nBACK ON THE PORCH - \nJEAN-PIERRE You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law. \nSAM Vincent told you that I'm a cop? \nJEAN-PIERRE Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop. \nAnd now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say, \"you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're gonna have a problem.\"  Sam notices the weapon, but he doesn't react overtly. \nSAM So this is what, a test? \nJEAN-PIERRE Call it a reckoning of character. \nBEAT.  Sam looks at the Revolver again. \nSAM If I was healthy, I could take that away from you. \nJEAN-PIERRE Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you. \nQUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of sight, but not out of ear shot.  He's listening to everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his own gun. \nBACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.  By now Jean-Pierre has raised the pistol.  He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks the hammer. \nSAM So what is it you want to know? \nJEAN-PIERRE I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created. \nSAM Created? \nJEAN-PIERRE Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. (beat) I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you. \nSAM Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai. \nJEAN-PIERRE You seem one to me. \nSAM A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire. (beat) The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival. \nLONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre. He relaxes his finger on the hammer. \nJEAN-PIERRE Survival.  I suppose that's as good a cause as any. \nBACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A PARIS STREET - DAY \nA BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office. Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.  Now, coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus Reilly.  Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.  There's no sign of the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into - \nINT. THE CAR - SAM TIME \nSAM What's the story? \nTONY It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners. \nVINCENT Do you have the tape? \nTONY I might know where you could get a copy. \nThe Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with him. \nTONY (to Vincent and Sam) Let me do some business with my boy here, and I'll meet you across the street in five.  I gotta make homes here feel like he's getting a good deal while I give him the pleasure of overpaying me for a couple of second generation pirates. \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nThe Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the street towards - \nINT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT \nA HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end. We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and Sam. \nTONY (his mouth full) What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix. \nVINCENT You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape? \nTONY All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version. \nSAM (instantly) Gaelic. \nTONY You sure? \nSAM I'm sure. \nVINCENT (to Tony) Can you get it? \nTONY The Russian would be easier. \nSAM Why's that? \nTONY Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find. \nSAM It's the Irish tape we want. \nTONY (with a sigh) Gonna be tough. \nTony scribbles something on a piece of paper. \nTONY Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly. \nSAM (repeating it, he knows this name) Seamus Reilly. \nVINCENT (to Sam) You know him? \nSAM I know of him. \nTONY Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying. \nVINCENT I get the picture. \nSam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand on top of it. \nVINCENT Tony and I have to talk some business, first. \nTONY I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle. \nVINCENT It's a matter of respect. (to Sam) Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long. \nSam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent are now discussing the price of the information.  They are both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying themselves immensely. \nVINCENT I know.  Jean-Pierre did. \nSAM You were behind the door? \nVINCENT I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to. \nSAM You would have done that? \nVINCENT I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have. \nSAM (almost to himself) How could you have done that? \nVINCENT Because I owe you. (he sees something) Look at that... \nTHEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the apartment building. \nSAM (O.S.) (quietly exultant) All things come to those who wait. \nNow Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor. \nVINCENT (O.S.) (really surprised by this) He's not dead. \nBACK ON Sam and Vincent. \nSAM (figuring it out) They don't have the package. \nVINCENT You think? \nSAM You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him. \nVincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it out. \nVINCENT & SAM (simultaneously) They're going to get it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the counter.  It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System. Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket which lets us know where his gun is.  Now - The two men start to move towards the exit as we - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATER/LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre behind the wheel.  She's staring so intently at the front of the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls across her.  She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the car.  Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts her off with a word. \nSAM Don't do it... \nSomething in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she backs off.  Now she and Sam exchange a long look. \nDEIRDRE Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself. (she really sounds betrayed) I can't believe I misjudged you like I did. \nSAM Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission? \nDEIRDRE I'm a patriate. \nSAM Don't even think that I'm buying that. \nDEIRDRE Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us. \nSAM I didn't say I was. \nDEIRDRE (she sees something) Bloody fucking hell... \nCUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office. By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor. Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he carries with him.  Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look. He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is still on her like a hawk. \nSAM Don't even think it. \nIN THE COMPACT - \nSEAMUS (lecturing Deridre) You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no... \nIN THE PEUGEOT - \nVINCENT You put everything on the line because you... \nIN THE COMPACT \nSEAMUS (as if finishing Vincent's sentence) You slept with the fucker!! \nON THE PERIFERIQUE - \nTHE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle, while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the roadways. \nVINCENT (O.S.) Fuck... \nIN THE PEUGEOT - \nVINCENT Left left left!!! \nSam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.  At the last second he takes the left turn as we go back to - \nIN THE COMPACT CAR - \nWhere Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening Gregor.  Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in the other. \nSEAMUS (waving the package) This better be the real thing or you're a dead man! \nGREGOR It is, I'm telling you it is!! \nSEAMUS You've told me a lot of things, boyo... \nZING-SHATTER!  A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out of his window, firing away.  Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre. \nSEAMUS Lose them! \nDEIRDRE You lose them! \nDeirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're both speeding towards another junction, where several other roadways of the Periferique run together.  Now we see that - Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre. \nSEAMUS To the right!!! \nDeirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now on an - \nEXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.  Now - \nDeirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars, but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along, and now - \nOne of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained by their seatbelts.  The car has stalled, and Sam has to start her up again and slam it into gear before following after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now - The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent. \nSAM Give me a cigarette. \nVINCENT Right now? \nSAM Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!! \nVINCENT (fumbling with a cigarette) Why are you driving? (rapid fire) You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving? \nHe puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!  About fifteen cars pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus breathes a hugh sigh of relief. \nSEAMUS About time! \nDEIRDRE (glancing in her mirror) Not yet... \nThe Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's back on their tail. \nVINCENT So I do it. \nSAM No you don't, and you know it. \nVINCENT If our positions were reversed, would you leave me? \nSAM (he says this too quickly) In a minute. \nVINCENT I think not. \nBEAT.  Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what Vincent is saying is true. \nVINCENT (considering the weapons) Do we need anything else? \nSAM Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined. \nVincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out laughing as we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILE/NIGHT \nDeirdre once behind the wheel.  The passenger seat next to her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror, which reveals - \nA glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge. \nDEIRDRE You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. \nSEAMUS (a hideous laugh) Plastic fucking surgeon? (indicates his face) You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. \nDEIRDRE You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... \nSEAMUS (losing it) Shut up!!! (he puts a gun to her head) Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!? \nBEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing. \nSEAMUS Do I need to repeat myself? \nDEIRDRE No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME \nTHE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does - \nA LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT \nTHE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN. Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like \"Da!\" and \"Nyet!\" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front, because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress - \nA WOODS - \nA forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam. Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit. They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands. \nSAM Not here.  They might see it. \nVINCENT If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. (takes the cigarettes back and lights one) Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing. \nVincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of his head. \nSAM Time to quit. \nVINCENT Just like that? \nSAM Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette. \nGREGOR (suddenly sharp) Enough! \nGregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his wrist via the handcuff.  Gregor rests the Briefcase on the table. \nMIKHI Ahh... \nThe moment of truth.  Before this scene can develop any further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice speaks, Gregor blanches. \nSEAMUS (O.S.) The moment of truth, is it? \nANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room. And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except for Gregor, that is).  It's as if they were expected. \nGREGOR What is he doing here? \nAs Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably closer to Gregor.  His face is, if anything, even more horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh wounds have started to scab over. \nSEAMUS What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together. \nGREGOR But you hate each other! \nSEAMUS What's a little hate between business partners? \nEXT. THE WOODS - MEANWHILE \nVincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men rise with a slow purpose.  They exchange a look and then Sam steps forward, leading the way \nSAM I'm on point, Vincent. \nA WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU - \nPure Kurosawa.  The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts to play again as - \nTHE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and into the brilliant light of the back lawn.  For one minute they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.  Now the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep from being discovered for as long as possible. \nBACK IN THE DINING ROOM - \nGREGOR (to Seamus) So, you've got it all figured, do you? \nSEAMUS Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him. \nGREGOR I think not. (holds up the Briefcase) I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off. \nDEIRDRE (under her breath) That fucking figures... \nGREGOR Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time. \nMIKHI And more importantly -- \nGREGOR I'll destroy whatever's in the case. \nBEAT.  Nobody moves.  Nobody speaks.  Until finally - \nSEAMUS It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna have to sit down to table and work out an agreement. \nBefore this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go back to - \nTHE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU - \nSam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth, avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go - \nBACK TO THE DINING ROOM \nAUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks. \nMIKHI What was that? \nBACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU - \nSam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective. \nSAM Call that number and ask them what you should do. \nThe Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously. \nFIVE MINUTES LATER - \nThe Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now - \nThe DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks back.  Everything in SUBTITLED. \nDOCTOR You can see your friend, now. \nSAM Thank you very much. \nDOCTOR The field dressing you put on saved his life. (giving him a look) Where di you learn to do that? \nSAM Here and there, I guess. \nThe Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past into - \nINT. VINCENT'S ROOM \nHe's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.  And he's heard Sam speak in French to the Doctor. \nVINCENT You son-of-a-bitch... \nSAM What? \nVINCENT You speak French. \nSAM What of it? \nVINCENT (in mock exasperation) Nothing... \nHe lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused. \nVINCENT (repeating the Doctor's words in English) \"Your field dressing saved his life.\" That's three I owe you. \nSAM You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me. (very seriously, he now believes this) I owe you a heavy debt. \nVINCENT (relishing this) I know. \nSAM (rising to leave) You better get some sleep, alright? \nVINCENT Tell me something first. (a quick beat) The package: what was it? \nSAM I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon. \nVINCENT What happened to it? \nSAM Gone.  Destroyed. \nVINCENT (sighs, then a beat) I guess that's for the best. \nSam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say. \nVINCENT Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake, you could have killed the two of them with one shot.  You could have had the package, finished the job.  But you didn't, you sacrificed the job to save her life.  Why? \nSame has to think about this for a second, and his answer reveals just how full circle he's come. \nSAM It's what you would have done. \nAnd on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused Vincent behind. \nEXT. THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING \n", "test1_input": "SWEDE It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world. \nLARRY Not in mine. \nTHE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.  Deirdre's Voice is heard on the speaker phone. \nDEIRDRE (V.O.) Hello gentlemen, are we ready? \nEXT. THE CAFE \nDeirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions. She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet intense. \nDEIRDRE You want to take a left, then, so that you're going west. \nDuring this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play, building with the action as we do - \nTHE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS - \nThe Volvo takes a flying left turn - \nGregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as - The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does the same flight through the air and lands with a thud - \nTHE CARAVAN of cars - \nTHE TARGET CAR - \nTHE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now - \nThe Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build to a crescendo as - \nThe Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind together, as - \nCARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat, which forces them to slam to a halt, as - \nLarry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS stop. \nLarry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet- proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle. \nSam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them, pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning fire as - \nLarry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER, which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as it scorches the air, traveling towards - \nThe LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the Car sideways. \nMeanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new one. \nAnd even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray, firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's side so that Sam can run towards - \nThe Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat, pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death himself as - \nSwede continues blasting away at the windshield with his monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver. \nNow Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires, winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits Swede with the Briefcase. \nTHE TARGET Fuck you! \nSWEDE Not today. \nBANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now - DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because - Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now - Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him. \nSWEDE I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy. \nLARRY (sees something over Swede's shoulder) I don't think so. \nSwede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin. Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger, firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground - Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS get louder. \nLARRY (in shock) He just...I don't believe that son-of- a... \n", "test1_true": "LARRY (still having trouble believing it) We've been crossed... \nThe SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive, charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car, and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET \nThe FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old City a coppery red. \nWe're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and turns of what an American would call back alleys but that pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted, then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried. Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear - \nLARRY (V.O.) What is this? \nINT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nA SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make- shift stand. \nSAM (answering Larry's question) It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. \nLARRY Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. (a quick beat) I don't mean that in, like, a literal way... \nDEIRDRE Of course. \nVINCENT Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is. (he looks at Deirdre, and suddenly he's deadly earnest) What did we steal? \nDEIRDRE (suddenly defensive) I don't know. \nVINCENT When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on. \nDEIRDRE Well I don't! \nVINCENT And I don't believe you... \nVincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as well, jammed into his stomach. \nDEIRDRE (suddenly feral) You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground. \nVINCENT (matching her intensity) I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth! \nSAM (O.S.) (with a dead cool in his voice) Both of you... \nANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun - an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is: whose side is he on? \nSAM (continuing without missing a beat) ...put your guns down and chill out. \nA BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons, followed by Sam. \nSAM Like it or now, we're on the same side: we're here and the package isn't. (looks at Deirdre) You're not the boss any more, you're our partner.  So tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this mess. \nSam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust based upon their physical intimacy. \nSAM Now, what did we steal? \nDEIRDRE (she hates to admit this) I don't know... (defensively, off Vincent's look) Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. (quick beat, then reluctantly continuing) But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob. \nLARRY Your people?  Who the fuck is your people? \nVINCENT Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA. \nDEIRDRE And you believed me? (passionately) But it wasn't my people who did it. \nLARRY How do we know that? \nSAM Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us. \nDEIRDRE Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede... \n", "test1_id": 2229, "test2_input": "Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry, the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as we go back - \nINTO THE THEATER - \nEdvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later, Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam. \nVINCENT You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you. \nSAM But you can't. \nAnd now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow Sam into - \nTHE TUNNELS - \nIt's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena. Except that everything here is made of stone and the only light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while - Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor sees the final exit ahead of him as we go - \nOUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that - The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back - \nIN THE TUNNELS - \nDeirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost reached the exit as - \nOUT IN THE STREET - \nGregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but as he runs by - \nThe car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it. He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured. Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one: SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear. \nSEAMUS (to Gregor, with an Irish accent) If you want to live you'll do exactly as I tell you. \nTHROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to - \nINT. THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME \nVincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels. Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren. Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face. It's Edvard. \nEDVARD Where do I know you from? \nVINCENT Vienna. \nEDVARD Of course...I remember.  I quite liked you, I'm sorry to have to do this. \nEdvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when - \nSAM (O.S.) Hey... \nEdvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.  Even as he squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head that kills Edvard. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE \nDeirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.  She sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if surprised. \nDEIRDRE Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you think? \nSCANT SECOND LATER - \nLarry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off, Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds from the wound in his side.  They arrive at the street only to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can even think to raise their guns. \nVINCENT That double-crossing bitch. \nSam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any we've seen in the film: \"how the hell did that happen?\"  But there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless, holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance, another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself, but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.  The door is yanked open and the Driver is yanked out, as we - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A BACK ROAD - LATER/EARLY EVENING \nThe town of Orange is just visible below us as the commandeered Car drives up into the hills.  Vincent is behind the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat. Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a small raw hole in Sam's side.  The wound bleeds, but moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit. \n", "test2_true": "SAM I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit. \nVINCENT You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor. \nSAM (hopeful) You know one around here?  Somebody you trust? \nVINCENT No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital. \nSAM (sharply) No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to. \nVINCENT (he can't believe this) Fix it yourself? (a thought comes to him) Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ... (he can't disguise his disgust) You're a cop. \nSAM Not exactly. \nVINCENT You're with Interpol -- you're a cop. \nSAM If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do. \nVINCENT And what job is that? \nSAM My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish. \nBEAT.  Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one to Vincent and takes another for himself.  They smoke for a second, before Vincent speaks. \nVINCENT It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group. \nSAM We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me. \nVINCENT I'm going with you. \nSAM This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this. \nVINCENT It isn't about money for me, not anymore. \nSAM You don't have to do this. \nVINCENT (with great finality) Yes I do. \nSam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief -- Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider this as we - \nCUT TO: \nINT. A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nA PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into - \nINT. AN ADJOINING ROOM \nwhere Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide with fright.  Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre turns to face Seamus Reilly. \nDEIRDRE When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself. \nSEAMUS Now there's the Deirdre I know. \nDEIRDRE And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly? \nSEAMUS It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it. \nDEIRDRE So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it? \nSEAMUS It's been known to happen. \nDEIRDRE Not to me, you know that. \nSEAMUS (goading her) I thought I did. \nSeamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it to his head. \n", "test2_id": 2230, "test3_input": "GREGOR (a feral hiss) We'll die if we stay here! \nMIKHI (threatening with the gun) You'll die if you leave here. \nGregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade, already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground, jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move to - \nTHE GALLERY - \nFilled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200 years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees - Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps out firing - \nAnd now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them, using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage, gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then - No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved Vincent's life. \nVINCENT You have to stop doing that! \nSAM I'll work on it... \nThe two men don't have time for any more words, they move from the Gallery and find themselves in - \nTHE DINING ROOM - \nWhere they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a VOICE comes from BEHIND them - \nSEAMUS (O.S.) Turn around real slow, and try hard not to breathe when you do it. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to find Sam in his place. \nSEAMUS It's you... (touches his face) You're the one did this to my face, are you? \nSAM That's me. \nSEAMUS Have a nice afterlife. \nSeamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side, a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time, and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal, taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen - \nDEIRDRE (O.S.) Seamus! \nANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the two men. \nSEAMUS Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking bullet in his head! \nDeirdre hesitates, uncertain. \nSEAMUS Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can find that stinking Gregor, he's got the bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a soldier... \nThese last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.  Her gun swivels towards Sam. \nSEAMUS (sensing he's getting to her) You're one of us...You been born and bred with your own people, you can't go against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm you're people. \nDeirdre makes up her mind. \nDEIRDRE I'm no girl, Seamus... \nShe fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW. \nDEIRDRE And you ain't nobody's people. \nShe moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded -- perhaps life-threateningly so. \nSAM (to Deirdre) Let's get him out of here... \nVINCENT Finish the job... \nSAM And now... \nVINCENT (a commanding whisper) Finish it! \nSam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window - \n", "test3_true": "DEIRDRE (calling out) Sam... \nSam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed out from blood loss. \nVINCENT I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go out and get the bastard. \nSame makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs out after Deirdre and towards - \nTHE PRIVATE DOCK - \nAnd as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM. \nDEIRDRE He's got the briefcase rigged to explode five seconds after anybody other than himself tries to open it. \nAnd now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat. \nSAM Deirdre, wait up -- \nBut it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind - \nA BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head. His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is still handcuffed to his wrist. \nGREGOR You might have made a good field agent you arrogant American prick, but you're not smart enough to go up against me. \nGregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body. \nGREGOR Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care. (beat) And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away. \nDEIRDRE Don't do it, Sam! \nGREGOR Shut up! \nDEIRDRE He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker. \nSEAMUS (O.S.) (a horrible croak) If you don't, I will... \nANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven him this far. \nSEAMUS (to Sam, in a cold pale rage) Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let you live. \nTHE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and for all, killed by - \nVincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary shot.  But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN - \nIMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're in SLOW MOTION as - \nGregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the other, into the lake, while - \nBABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while - THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be possible for her to have survived - her head splits the surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help her out. \nSAM Are you alright? \nDEIRDRE Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here! \nSam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.

JENNY Are you stupid or something. 
FORREST Mommy says stupid is as stupid does. 
Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over and shakes her hand. 
JENNY I'm Jenny. 
FORREST I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump. 
FORREST (V.O.) From that day on, we was always together. Jenny and me was like peas and carrots. 
EXT. OAK TREE - DAY 
Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree. 
FORREST (V.O.) She taught me how to climb... 
Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest. 
JENNY Come on, Forrest, you can do it. 
Forrest dangles from the branch. 
FORREST (V.O.) ...I showed her how to dangle. 
Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read. 
FORREST "...a good little monkey and..." 
FORREST (V.O.) She helped me to learn how to read. 
Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree. 
FORREST (V.O.) And I showed her to swing. 
EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT 
The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit on a branch. 
FORREST (V.O.) Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars. 
FORREST Momma's gonna worry about me. 
Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand. 
JENNY Just stay a little longer. 
FORREST (V.O.) For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home. 
FORREST Okay, Jenny. I'll stay. 
FORREST (V.O.) She was my most special friend. 
INT. SAVANNAH/BUS STOP - DAY 
Forrest nods as he remembers. 
FORREST My only friend. 
Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up from her magazine. 
FORREST Now, my Momma always told me that miracles happen every day. Some people don't think so, but they do. 
EXT. OAK ALLEY - ANOTHER DAY (1954) 
Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks. 
BOY #1 Hey... dummy! 
Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him. 
BOY #2 Are you retarded, or just plain stupid? 
BOY #3 Look, I'm Forrest Gump. 
Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more dirt clods at Forrest. 
JENNY Just run away, Forrest. 
Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm. 
JENNY Run, Forrest! 
Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him. 
JENNY Run away! Hurry! 
Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes. 
BOY #2 Get the bikes! 
BOY #3 Hurry up! 
The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.

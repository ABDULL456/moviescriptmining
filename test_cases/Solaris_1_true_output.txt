GIBARIAN You'll end up like me. 
KELVIN You're not Gibarian... 
GIBARIAN No?  Who am I, then? 
KELVIN A puppet. 
GIBARIAN And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human! 
Gibarian smiles. 
KELVIN 
wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled: 
RHEYA What's wrong? 
KELVIN Gibarian.  He was here. 
RHEYA You said he was dead. 
KELVIN He is.  But he was here... 
He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian, some proof.  Finding none: 
KELVIN He spoke to me. 
Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows. 
INT.  LAB 
Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's body. 
It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not with him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She just looks at them. 
KELVIN Are you going to take them? 
She nods and takes them. 
RHEYA What's happening to us? 
KELVIN It's all right. 
RHEYA Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here.  Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it. 
KELVIN I love you. 
RHEYA Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive. 
He goes to her.

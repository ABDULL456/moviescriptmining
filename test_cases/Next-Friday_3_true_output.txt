MR. JONES Go to the body, Craig!  Go to the body! 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Day-Day and Roach have made it a little further to the door, but they still look like fish searching for H2O.  Uncle Elroy stumbles in.  He grabs a knife and starts to cut them loose. 
UNCLE ELROY Boy, Day-Day, I'mma kick yo' ass for getting me into this mess and hurting my back!  I moved out here to get away from this kinda shit! 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Fight's still on.  Craig is giving Joker the ass-whipping he deserves when Uncle Elroy, Day-Day and Roach reach the back porch. 
DAY-DAY Get 'em, Craig! 
ROACH Bite his ear! 
UNCLE ELROY What 'em!  Watch 'em! 
Joker takes a few more shots from Craig, then grabs Craig around the waist and slams him to the ground.  Craig is hurt. 
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Get off yo' back, Craig! 
Craig struggles with Joker, who now has the devil in his eyes. 
CRAIG Ya'll mothafuckas help me! 
Day-Day and Roach look at each other.  They rush to Craig's aide.  Joker spots them coming, he also spots the AK. 
In SLOW MOTION, Day-Day and Roach dive on Joker...at the same time Joker dives for the AK.  Day-Day and Roach land on top of Craig and our trio try to hurry to their feet.  But as soon as they get up, they're looking down the barrel of an AK- 
JOKER (smiling) Say hello to my little friend. 
BOOM! 
Debo hits Joker from the back.  Joker is out cold. 
DEBO No way, Jose.  This one is mine. 
Ezal picks up the gun and hands it to Debo. 
DEBO (cont'd) Hi, Craig, remember me? 
Craig knows he can't fight a gun.  Everybody is helpless.  We can hear SIRENS getting CLOSER and CLOSER.  Suddenly, out of nowhere... 
CHEECO! 
The pitbull is back!  And he's mad as hell.  He runs through everybody and jumps on Debo, knocking the gun from his hand. Craig and Day-Day jump on Debo.  Roach WHISTLES, and Cheeco stops his attack on Debo. 
Cheeco runs over to Roach and jumps in his arms.  Roach's being licked to death by the pitbull. 
DAY-DAY Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach? 
ROACH He's a boy, dude. 
EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Out front, three sheriff cars swoop into the driveway.  The cops jump out, guns drawn. 
EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Debo and Ezal are tied up next to the Jokers. 
EZAL Mr. Jones, we was just playin'.  He made me do it. 
Mr. Jones don't wanna hear it.  Craig runs into the house. Uncle, Day-Day, Roach and Cheeco look at the five on the ground...it's over, or is it? 
SHERIFF #3 Freeze, Sheriff's Department! 
The SHERIFFS are on our heroes, guns drawn.

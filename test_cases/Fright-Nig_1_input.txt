ED (CONT'D) And that's you guys at the center, see? His windows are totally 
BLACKED OUT-- 
CHARLIE There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip-- 
ED But every window? No. I've been watching him. It all fits-- 
CHARLIE That Jerry's a Dracula. 
ED No. Dracula is a specific vampire. 
I'M SAYING-- 
CHARLIE I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight-- 
ED Fiction, okay? This is real. A real monster. And he's not brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble. He's the fucking shark from JAWS. He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead. 
(MOST EMPHATIC) And that book SUCKS. Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real. But he shakes it off. 
CHARLIE 
COME ON-- 
ED What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you? 
CHARLIE Yeah, in San Diego like a month ago! 
ED Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation. 
CHARLIE No, but-- 
ED Your mom? Lonely divorcee... 
CHARLIE You're on drugs. 
ED No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd take my word, but I have evidence at home. Hard evidence. Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it. 
CHARLIE Yeah. Okay. 
ED 
(INTENSE) We have to stake him in his nest. You and me. Not now, it's dark. 
CHARLIE Right. Cause he's nocturnal. 
ED Just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now-- 
CHARLIE Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight-- 
ED 
SIXTEEN-- 
CHARLIE 
(LOSING IT) Whatever! I grew up, okay? You don't want to, fine. But don't get an attitude because I'd rather have a life than make shit up! Ed stops. Stung. 
ED Right. Got it. You're soooo cool "Brewster." Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers. This is the pinnacle for them. And that includes your girl-- 
CHARLIE Shut up.

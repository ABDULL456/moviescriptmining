THE BRAIN (on the phone) You didn't call. 
BRENDAN Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't she? THE BRAIN Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill. 
BRENDAN Get the numbers? 
THE BRAIN No. Sorry. 
BRENDAN S'alright. Are me and Brad front page news? 
THE BRAIN All the buzz. You really do that? 
BRENDAN Yeah. 
THE BRAIN Why? Is Brad the Pin? 
BRENDAN Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though. 
BRAIN For kicks? 
BRENDAN Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang? 
THE BRAIN I told you before I don't know the car. Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody I know that you don't. And Trueman again- 
BRENDAN Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I need to find that kid. 
THE BRAIN Okay. 
Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly. 
A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face. 
Brendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows. 
Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face. 
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off O.S. 
Brendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
INT. OFFICE Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office. A man in his early thirties behind a wood colored 
desk and name plate, "GARY TRUEMAN, ASSISTANT VICE PRINCIPAL" plays with a pencil. 
TRUEMAN You didn't know this boy? 
BRENDAN No sir, never seen him. 
TRUEMAN And he just hit you? 
BRENDAN Like I said, he asked for my lunch money first. Good thing I brown bagged it. 
Trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on Brendan. 
TRUEMAN Alright Brendan. I've been looking to talk to you. 
Brendan doesn't react. 
TRUEMAN (cont'd) You've helped this office out before. 
BRENDAN No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed. 
TRUEMAN Fine, and well put. 
BRENDAN Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk. 
TRUEMAN Tough teacher? 
BRENDAN Tough but fair. 
TRUEMAN Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean, and you've, despite your motives, you've been an asset to us. I think you're a good kid. BRENDAN Uh huh. 
TRUEMAN I want to run a couple names by you.

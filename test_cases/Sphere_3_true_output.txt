HARRY Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion. 
Norman watching them... 
HARRY Wisconsin's your answer. 
NORMAN Wisconsin? 
HARRY (off screen) Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin. 
NORMAN How do we decode it? 
HARRY Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you. 
THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally... 
"SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS TO YOUR LOCATION ETA: 1600 HOURS.  END." 
Norman and Beth smile... 
NORMAN The cavalry is on it's way. 
THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count. 
BETH Just in time, too. 
HARRY In time for what? 
BETH What? 
HARRY Just in time for what? 
Beth, nervous, tries to cover... 
BETH Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack. 
HARRY Another attack? 
A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry. 
HARRY Why are you looking at me like that? 
BETH Like what?  I'm not -- 
HARRY You're staring at me. 
BETH No I'm not.  I'm not star-- 
HARRY Yes you are... 
Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously... 
HARRY Did I miss something?  You two seemed to patch things up awfully fast. 
A tense beat. 
NORMAN We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this. 
HARRY The three of us. 
NORMAN That's right. 
HARRY (beat) Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag? 
Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL." 
INT.  LABRATORY 
CLOSE ON THE MEDICAL CABINET -- WHIPPING open. 
Norman quickly digs through the medicines... 
NORMAN Diphenyl parlene. 
BETH (O.S.) Something for burns. 
NORMAN Ephedrine hydrochloride. 
Beth at the computer, looking up the names... 
BETH It's for motion sickness. 
NORMAN Valdomet. 
BETH Ulcers. 
NORMAN Sintag. 
BETH A synthetic opium analogue. 
NORMAN Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under. 
BETH Nothing about drowsiness. 
NORMAN Tarazine? 
BETH Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness. 
NORMAN Bingo. 
BETH "... and may also cause bizarre halucinations". 
Norman throws it on the floor.  Picks another... 
NORMAN Riordan? 
BETH Antihistamine.  For bites. 
NORMAN Damn it!  Chloramphenicol? 
BETH Antibiotic. 
NORMAN Parasolutrine? 
BETH How do you spell it? 
NORMAN P-a-r-a-s-o... 
BETH It's a soporific. 
NORMAN What's that? 
BETH Causes sleep.

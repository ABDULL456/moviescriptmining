The travellers settle down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife working at the open fire. (CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                     56 PRIEST Just bread and water for me, Mistress. I have no need of wine or meat. She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver- sation with the Almighty. \n57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57 In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a blanket of soft sound over the human forms. \nOne of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs. Hector rouses himself and follows the other. \n58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58 Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 * figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector standing by the table. They recognize one another and relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He speaks normally, cheekily. \nPRIEST God, I'm starving. Do you think I dare heat that up on the fire? \nHe indicates the large pot containing the remains of the stew. PRIEST No... I'll eat it cold... I deserve to suffer. \nHe pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the table to Hector. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                       58 Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks of meat as they talk. \nPRIEST Have some wine. \nHector takes a drink. \nHECTOR I saw some fighting today... back up the road... \nPRIEST So, the mad knights are at it again... what were they, Swiss or English? \nHECTOR I don't know.    They all look the same to me. PRIEST It might help us get through... if there's a bit of confusion... we'll still travel separately though, for now. The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own holy act. PRIEST But, Hector, you must keep out of the way of temptation... I saw the way you were eyeing up that widow... now stay away from that... although she is beautiful, is she not... but we're going home, remember. Hector is smiling. \nHECTOR How do you know she's a widow? PRIEST Look at her eyes... hungry eyes... she could lead you into trouble... she smells like paradise, though. He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  58 PRIEST Listen, Hector, let's get this clear... if anyone's going to dally with that widow it'll be me... you couldn't handle her... she'd bewitch you... at any rate, you're not a sinning kind of fellow, are you... why don't you get off up the road tomorrow, and I'll catch you up, in five or so days... \nHector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely. PRIEST You're not a sinning fellow, remember... another month and we'll be at the channel, then home... the little ones you only talk about when you're drunk... don't forget them... Hector still remains silent.        The Priest is worried. \nPRIEST Why do I always talk so much... you weren't even thinking of her 'til I opened my mouth... but I trust you... don't worry. I know you wouldn't do anything to anger your God, or me. Get me some bread. Hector obeys the Priest without thought.        The Priest is           * happier now that he is in control again. PRIEST Who saved your neck in Venice? HECTOR You did, Ronald. \nHector approaches the Priest with the bread. PRIEST And don't you forget it. \nHe raises his cup to Hector. PRIEST May the Lord forgive us our sins, those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of. She's a glory of a woman. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58 For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims Hector needs him. \n59   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            59 \nOvernight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             * from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               * watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires. \n", "test1_true": "HECTOR I won't be travelling today. \nThe Priest looks him straight in the eye. PRIEST The fighting's behind us, brother ... you'll be safe enough. Hector shakes his head, catching Beatrice's eye. \nHECTOR I'll stay. PRIEST You should go. \nThe Nun puts an arm around the Girl.

God will protect his ewe lambs.                                          * Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man- handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems inhuman, robot-like. \nSOLDIER Must be sore in there.   Is it your dada? The Squire looks at him and nods his head.       Hector looks        * with sympathy at the boy.                                            * \nSOLDIER #2 If he's got a little head it might be alright. Has your dada got a big head? \nAn OFFICER comes into the room. OFFICER Is there a blacksmith here? Where's the smith? FARM WOMAN In the village, sir, half a day away. The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the Priest. OFFICER You, Priest, come here... get to work on him... he's not ready for heaven yet... there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if I get him to Paris alive... Start                         * praying... there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives... \nThe Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers. \n(CONTINUED) \n60   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              60 OFFICER Get that helmet off... get hammers, anything you can find...                      * and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an armorer. \nThe Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            * takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          * father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor twitches and MOANS. \nHector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they slide past the table and head for the door. \n61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61 More soldiers have continued to make their way to the shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war. Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups. Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir- teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in expensive armor. \nHector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers, reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci- plined unit. Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting their pikes in unison. They become like one evil, inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                * more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love-play. \nHECTOR I think you know what I'm saying ... a little... \n(CONTINUED) \n61   CONTINUED:                                                    61 BEATRICE No, I don't, I don't understand a word. HECTOR How come you don't speak like anyone else? Are you far from home? Home? Where you sleep and live? BEATRICE I think I know what you mean... home. HECTOR I'm far from home, too... way, way                    * over there... then across the sea... BEATRICE You're losing me again. HECTOR Have you ever seen the sea? Water                     * everywhere... right to the end of the world... I come from the other side of the little water, then                        * there's the big, big water...

They never came back... they fell off the world... Hector smiles, pleased with himself.    Beatrice laughs. HECTOR You think that's funny? It's true... it's a sad story... you shouldn't laugh. BEATRICE Talk about home again... remember                     * you said home? HECTOR I'm not making sense, am I? Well, let's go back to homes. That's where I'm going...

BEATRICE I know what you're saying... you're saying home... say something else. HECTOR Home... home... try it... home... BEATRICE You want the word for home? It's home... say it... home... home... \nHECTOR I don't want your word for home, I want you to say mine... home... home... BEATRICE Come on, you can do it... home... home... Beatrice has her way, turning the tables on Hector.    He says it in her language. \nHECTOR Home... home... Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of their relationship is set. BEATRICE That's it... clever boy! \nThey fall silent, suddenly shy. Beatrice breaks this             * moment by reaching out to Hector's neck, very delicately, like a caress. Hector smiles. There first touch. Then            * it changes. Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp grab at Hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something. Triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught. \nBEATRICE Tick... it's a tick. HECTOR Flea... a flea... thanks. \nBeatrice looks at him directly now, their intimacy well under way.

She ruffles his hair, in a motherly but then again sex-                  * ually provocative way. He understands her well now. \nHECTOR Why don't we go somewhere and have a good session... I could do you... I'd like to give you a good grooming... They understand each other perfectly now.         They look around for a more private spot. \n62   INT. FARM - DAY                                                     62 Ronald the Priest still kneels by the inert knight in armor. The boy Squire still sits by his father's head. Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside. OFFICER How is he? PRIEST Sleeping now... at peace, for the moment. OFFICER Leave him for a while. There are                            * a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven.

BORIS Everything can be fixed... always. \nThen Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower motifs and slogans like \"ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS,\" and \"FRESH OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE.\" Anna is a florist. Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car. He runs to meet her. ANNA Get in... you can dropp me at the shop. Hector gets into the car, smiling broadly. \n152   INT.

CAR - DAY                                         153 A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence whatever you do with it, and that's fine. Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the threads together. And after so many images of the natural world, a world little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen- sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New Jersey Hector will complete his journey. We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE RINGS ONCE. \nHECTOR Hello... Leonard, hello... yes... we're insured... thank God... yes now I know God's a lawyer... thanks... On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban street he is looking for.

BETSY Everything you buy is junk... I don't eat steak... and what's this... She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers. \nBETSY Ugh! Why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it... A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice. Hector warms to her. \nHECTOR You're right. \nHector pushes the cart to her. \nHECTOR Well, get to it... I'll just tag along... \nBetsy moves off with the cart. BETSY I do it every week anyway. (CONTINUED) \n156   CONTINUED:    (2)                                          156 Thomas backs her up. \nTHOMAS She does. She tells us what to eat. We let her. \nHector follows them up the aisle. \nHECTOR Can I just keep a couple of those steaks? We can't live on chicken.                   * \n157   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157 \nHector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the back of the car the kids have watched it all. Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car. \n158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158 Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep, searching for some traces of the little children that have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots he abandoned. \n159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159 \n", "test3_true": "160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160 Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW. A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones which he regularly scatters on the floor. \nTV MAN (V.O.) This is good, Tony, the stones are talking to me already... now here's something... travel... movement... Tony, are you planning a move... travel... anything? TONY (V.O.) Yes I am... I've been thinking about a move to California... \nTV MAN (V.O.) The big one, eh, Tony? These stones are really talking here... what are you planning for yourself in California? TONY (V.O.) I'm hoping for an acting career, Mel... TV MAN (V.O.) Tony, these stones really like what you're planning... there is no doubt in my mind about that... now listen... you have to be specific... these stones really want to tell you something, be it love, money or the purpose of your life... but I want a specific question from you... think about it... what do you want to know... love... or your income level next year? Be as specific as you can, Tony... \nPerhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He stands up and leaves the room. \n161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161 Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright. (CONTINUED) \n161   CONTINUED:                                                      161 Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep. \nBETSY Get me the books... all the books... all of the books... no, no, no... not the pancakes... not the pancakes... no... She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully. \nBETSY ... not the pancakes... \nHector is a confusion of feelings: frightened, fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door. TV WOMAN (V.O.) ... find your true cosmic partner first time around... every weekday morning at three here on the Psychic Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating Show... remember there is an answer, and there is a special partner out there for you... Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas. THOMAS ... don't let the oil run out... yes you did... watch the oil... why... why? Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved human being. \n162   INT. HOUSE - MORNING                                          162 \nIn the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen. The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is scrambling some eggs. \nHECTOR How about some eggs? They shake their heads. \n(CONTINUED) \n162   CONTINUED:                                                 162 HECTOR You don't eat eggs? \nBETSY How many have you got in there? \nHECTOR Three.   Is that all right? BETSY For a week, maybe. \nHector does a little probing. HECTOR How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you like pancakes? BETSY Not much... why? HECTOR I just wondered. Pancakes don't mean much to you? BETSY They don't mean a thing.     Why? HECTOR Nothing. The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity. Hector changes the subject. \nHECTOR I thought we could walk into town this morning. I saw the Funfair when we came through last night. THOMAS We don't go to Funfairs. \nHECTOR Let's take the walk anyway. \nTHOMAS I brought some books.   I want to stay home and read. Hector is determined to make it work. \nHECTOR No.   We're taking a walk. \n163   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                         163 They are preparing to leave the house.   Thomas is still reluctant to go. \nTHOMAS It's going to rain... we should stay. \nHECTOR Here's an umbrella... and there must be some old coats in here... and shoes... I only have these I'm wearing... THOMAS Donald has some shoes... \nThomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs.   He emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes. HECTOR I don't know if I want to wear Donald's shoes. THOMAS Why not? Hector declines to explain the complex   reasons that he might have for not wanting to wear the   shoes of his children's replacement father. He sits    down on the            * stairs to put them on. Then something    on the wall catches his eye. HECTOR Wow.   Look at this. The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them. \nHECTOR Six years ago. Look at that... What's this? \nHe points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall. THOMAS That was the flood. The sea came right up. Donald says it's the icecap melting. It's going to get worse. That's why Mom's selling the place. \n", "test3_id": 830}

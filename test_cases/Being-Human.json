But there is just one story. Because we blend into one developing narrative the lives that we show. \nThere is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real time and with real characters what other movies strive to do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are dealing with is real, human magic. In moving from one character to the next everything will change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate to the one before and the one following. The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one character and advancing the film through hundreds or thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi- tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it together. The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human connection at the heart of the film is that one actor will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple drama of being alive. We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave and the others who have gone before. The resolution of his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps, we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec- tive, too. \nAnd the structure of the film itself has the thrill of novelty. It has never before been used in cinema. Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta- lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the planet itself and all its people, come and go in the story. For the audience the game of making the connec- tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering associations of their own, will be endless in this big- gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new cinematic experience.                                       * \nBEING HUMAN Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com- fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family. Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten square miles of it. \nFADE IN: FIRST IMAGE is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself, deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and fingers a blemish on his cheek. Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns. Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out. HECTOR Go back home... leave me alone... \nWe see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and disappearing behind the rocks. \n1-4   TITLE SCENES                                               1-4 \nThe small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and throws him hard, much too hard, on his back. \n(CONTINUED) \n1-4   CONTINUED:                                                   1-4 The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on. Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci- nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him? Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector. \nIt is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi- cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it. On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep. Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover. We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching, learning children. Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave. The Boy wants to go foraging with him again. \nHECTOR No... stay here... stay! Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows. \nHECTOR No... go back... go away... \nHector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides. The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector walks on for some time before turning on him. \nHECTOR Leave me alone! Stay here... Stay! \nThere is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it. With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach. \n5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5 Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles, seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed. Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light paperwork propped up on some pillows. \nThe sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur- veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro- vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte- gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land- scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist, never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world being rather empty. Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of their cave. Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh- tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some- thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar- driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows is fear, blind, gut-turning fear. \n6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6 \nHector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up the steep slope in the direction of his home. (CONTINUED) \n16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16 The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover. His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            * whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         * \nThe last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis- tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of departure, watches the faces of his family. Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         * runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling. Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          * motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely. His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         * The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat. He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him. The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise man, although he's still only about thirty years old. The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him, take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        * as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          * own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           * \n17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17 Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely. At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of large stones at the very summit of the headland. The mound of stones is obviously man-made. PRIEST I told you! I knew they did it around here! Ask him... The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a friendly, reasoning tone. \nLEADER What do we do? Do we throw you over, is that the idea? Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly. LEADER He wants me to throw you over. What does it do? Does it help the sun? Should I throw you over? The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know how to respond. PRIEST I tell you, it's one man, one stone. It'll help the voyage. The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He squats down and squints through it to the watery sun emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits down beside him. They sit together like friends. The ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim. \nLEADER What's it got to do with the sun? PRIEST I don't know, yet. \nThe Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind. (CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 LEADER No.  It's too much of a risk. Just add a stone to the pile. Let him go. That's the best we can do.  Let's go. \nWith that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment, almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action. \nPRIEST It's meaningless, without him going over the cliff. \nThe Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean- ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope that binds his hands. When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector. LEADER Off you go.   We don't want you. He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in following them. They    are his only connection now with anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link with them is all that   is left. Again and again the Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags along behind. \n18   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               18 \nThe Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him. The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life. (CONTINUED) \n18   CONTINUED:                                                 18 Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under- stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades back to the boat. \nAs the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles. Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a family. \nHector watches them for some time, his family and the strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from his view and his life. At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge, picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks off with it. It might be of some use to him. \n19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19 Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty of life. He is working on his instincts now, still emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         * and blow at the fire's remains. We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems of emotional survival without his family lie ahead. \n20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20 \nThis is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive, low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting. Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood. We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam at every joint. \n21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21 Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance, some around the edge of the pool, others in the water rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie- torial way that they look after their masters gives the place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over- indulged grown-ups. \nAnd then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall, holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         * by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need that he might have. \nHector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        * man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius' pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         * immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as Lucinnius climbs out of the water. LUCINNIUS I'm going to the cool room. \n22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   * Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him, a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are Hector's also. Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and the massage room as they go. All around them slaves attend to their pampered masters. \n23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   * \nAfter an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes towards three men occupying a marble bench. (CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                                   23 Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends. The eldest of the three gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con- tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave and master exist so closely together that many of their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange. From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too, Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's. Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic schizophrenia? As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres- sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one of the three. MAN #1 Well washed, Lucinnius. \nLucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              * \n24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24 \nLUCINNIUS Of course. \nHECTOR This is the worst it's been. \n37   EXT. COURTYARD - DAY                                           37 \nHector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that he lost. Today there is an air of distraction about Hector. Understandable, considering his scheduled death. The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk. \nHECTOR But even if it's round you can still fall off the edge. Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make his point. GALLUS No... it's not round like that... it's round like this. Gallus sees his playball.     He picks it up. \nHECTOR Do you believe everything that Greek tells you...? \nGallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball. GALLUS Rome must be right in the middle... here... and we must be out here somewhere... Hector becomes more interested. \n(CONTINUED) \n37   CONTINUED:                                                37 HECTOR So, where is my home? \nGALLUS How many months did they march you here? \nHECTOR Seven. Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers,      * as if there is serious calculation.                            * GALLUS It must be about here.                            * \nHis fingers stop on the other side of the ball. GALLUS But then you'd be upside down... HECTOR I wasn't upside down... and how                   * could you see the sun round there ... I saw the sun at home... every day... Gallus is stumped for answers.                                 * \nGALLUS I'll ask him tomorrow...                          * Hector remembers that he and the boy's father are              * supposed to die that night. He looks on Gallus with a          * new tenderness. HECTOR Yes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like to know... because my children are round there and I want to know that they're getting the sun... ask him something else, too... where are the gods if the whole thing is round? \nGALLUS I think I know that... they're out here, and all around... that's how they can look down and see everything... \n38   INT. ALTAR - NIGHT                                        38 Lucinnius is at it again. In the lamplight, a live chicken stands on the altar. (CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                                   38 Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended on it. Perhaps they do. \nLUCINNIUS If he eats the grain it means yes. \nHe scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once begins to peck them up. HECTOR It's saying yes... there's a way... \nLUCINNIUS No, it's saying yes, we should die. \nHECTOR But you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way... it's saying yes, there is... LUCINNIUS No, it's saying yes, we should die. The bird is certainly enjoying his food. HECTOR Maybe it's just hungry... The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be. 39   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                     39 A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also there, serving her mistress. Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what. She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook from the kitchen. DALMIA Solus! \nThe kitchen slave quickly appears. DALMIA Solus... I'm eating chicken again. I ate chicken yesterday and the day before... will I be eating chicken again tomorrow? Why am I always eating chicken? \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                  39 SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector, but they offer him no help. \nSOLUS It's what we have to hand in the kitchen, ma'am... I always try to use the fresh stuff... the chickens have just been turning up... He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she was before. \nA SLAVE interrupts them. \nSLAVE Two men have come to see you. From Cyprian. Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a moment of hope. They might be coming with good news, perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart. \n40   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT                                 40 The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers. They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that they would break his back at the whim of their master. VISITOR Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian asked us if we could be of any                      * assistance... in the business that you have to conduct tonight... to make that business as...                            * comfortable... as you could wish... Lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires. \n43   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           43 LUCINNIUS Take it... do it... \nLucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released from the wound. His voice is even more faint. \nLUCINNIUS Do it, Hector... do it... do it... Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits, looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from him. LUCINNIUS Do it... do it... do it... The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still. Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor. Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest against the wall. \n44   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                          44 Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain- ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals. 45   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                      45 \nHector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into the house. 46   INT. THALIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                  46 \nThalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder, trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two Thalia opens her eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \n46   CONTINUED:                                                     46 Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her mouth. \nHECTOR I'm leaving... come now if you want to... but we must hurry... I'm a free man... I'm free. Will you come? \n47   EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT                                            47 \nThe shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the            * harbor are Hector and Thalia.                                       * \nNearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout, WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him. HECTOR I have some mail for Tyre... where are the east-bound ships? WATCHMAN Ask at the harbor.                                     * With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels. Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot. HECTOR We want a timber ship... they go west... straight to Rome... \nTHALIA And then?   Then you go home?                          * Hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply. \nHECTOR You can go to anywhere from Rome. \n48   EXT. QUAY - NIGHT                                              48 Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with timber. Final supplies are being carried aboard, super- vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them. \nHECTOR Where is the Captain? \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:                                                 48 CREWMAN He's on the ship. \nHe indicates a man standing on the rear deck. Hector and Thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him. \nHECTOR Good morning, Captain... I'm looking for passage to Rome, for both of us... \nCAPTAIN And who might you be? HECTOR I'm the steward of Lucinnius the merchant... we have business in Rome... I need an immediate passage... CAPTAIN It's five or six days... to                        * Brundisium... you can walk or ride from there... you have money? HECTOR Of course. CAPTAIN Well, let's see... passage for two... food for two... six days... what were you thinking of offering? HECTOR When do you leave? CAPTAIN Anxious to leave, are you? HECTOR Keen to start, yes. \n49   INT. SHIP - DAY                                            49 Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor- ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters. \nA CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA- WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS. \nCREWMAN Captain says to come on deck. Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea. \n50   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                             50 There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every- thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         * the ship. Her excitement is childlike. \nTHALIA Where's the land gone? Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the empty horizon noncommittally. THALIA Have you been on a ship before? \nHECTOR Yes, of course. We can tell he is lying. THALIA Me, too, but they kept us down there. She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then she gets even more excited. \n56   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         56 \nThe Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife working at the open fire. (CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                     56 PRIEST Just bread and water for me, Mistress. I have no need of wine or meat. She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver- sation with the Almighty. \n57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57 In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a blanket of soft sound over the human forms. \nOne of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs. Hector rouses himself and follows the other. \n58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58 Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 * figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector standing by the table. They recognize one another and relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He speaks normally, cheekily. \nPRIEST God, I'm starving. Do you think I dare heat that up on the fire? \nHe indicates the large pot containing the remains of the stew. PRIEST No... I'll eat it cold... I deserve to suffer. \nHe pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the table to Hector. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                       58 Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks of meat as they talk. \nPRIEST Have some wine. \nHector takes a drink. \nHECTOR I saw some fighting today... back up the road... \nPRIEST So, the mad knights are at it again... what were they, Swiss or English? \nHECTOR I don't know.    They all look the same to me. PRIEST It might help us get through... if there's a bit of confusion... we'll still travel separately though, for now. The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own holy act. PRIEST But, Hector, you must keep out of the way of temptation... I saw the way you were eyeing up that widow... now stay away from that... although she is beautiful, is she not... but we're going home, remember. Hector is smiling. \nHECTOR How do you know she's a widow? PRIEST Look at her eyes... hungry eyes... she could lead you into trouble... she smells like paradise, though. He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  58 PRIEST Listen, Hector, let's get this clear... if anyone's going to dally with that widow it'll be me... you couldn't handle her... she'd bewitch you... at any rate, you're not a sinning kind of fellow, are you... why don't you get off up the road tomorrow, and I'll catch you up, in five or so days... \nHector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely. PRIEST You're not a sinning fellow, remember... another month and we'll be at the channel, then home... the little ones you only talk about when you're drunk... don't forget them... Hector still remains silent.        The Priest is worried. \nPRIEST Why do I always talk so much... you weren't even thinking of her 'til I opened my mouth... but I trust you... don't worry. I know you wouldn't do anything to anger your God, or me. Get me some bread. Hector obeys the Priest without thought.        The Priest is           * happier now that he is in control again. PRIEST Who saved your neck in Venice? HECTOR You did, Ronald. \nHector approaches the Priest with the bread. PRIEST And don't you forget it. \nHe raises his cup to Hector. PRIEST May the Lord forgive us our sins, those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of. She's a glory of a woman. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58 For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims Hector needs him. \n59   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            59 \nOvernight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             * from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               * watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires. \nThe Officer leaves.       Ronald quickly follows him outside.            * RONALD                                        * Twenty sous is normal.    How many                          * are there?                                                  * \nWhen they have gone the Squire gives his father a nudge,                 * but there is no response from the knight, just the impression of lifeless bulk. \n63   EXT. FARM - DAY                                             63 Hector and Beatrice have found some privacy, near the trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide them from full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross- legged and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head a thorough going over. Mutual grooming is the original, and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. Hector certainly likes it. \nBEATRICE That's four. \nHECTOR Yes, it does feel good. She gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops. \nBEATRICE You can do me now. Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            * She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers. Hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly         * her scalp and neck, still with the outward purpose of looking for fleas. HECTOR Got one... a tiny little one... yours are so small... and fair...                      * To Hector even her fleas are a delight. He seems to want         * to keep it as a pet. There is no hope for this man.              * Beatrice moans softly, happily. Hector still kneading            * her scalp. HECTOR I don't know your name. I'm Hector... who are you? I'm Hector. Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness. \nBEATRICE Hector... yes... I'm Beatrice... \nHECTOR Beatrice. BEATRICE Yes. Hector... I think you'll have to do under my arms... I'm a little itchy there... (CONTINUED) \n63   CONTINUED:                                                     63 HECTOR Yes, I think Beatrice is a good name.                                                  * Beatrice is sighing contentedly now. \nBEATRICE Maybe we should find the river, and have a proper wash... In between parting the hairs on her scalp Hector is kiss- ing her on the neck now. At first it is small, snatched kisses amongst the grooming, but soon the kisses become longer and the grooming less. \nBEATRICE I'm still itchy lots of places, Hector. \n64   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            64 The Priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers, laid out in a corner of the farmyard. Whether he is a bogus priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties seriously. There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave. They have acquired a mule. They mount up, the Girl behind the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard. They stop briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells. PRIEST Goodbye, little girl... the Lord will bless you, I know, in his house. He talks to the Nun as they move off. \nPRIEST How long for you on the road? \nNUN Three or four days. PRIEST Good luck to you. \nNUN They're not killing nuns, yet. \nPRIEST The Saxon, won't he go with you? (CONTINUED) \n64   CONTINUED:                                                  64 NUN He's nowhere to be seen. \nThe Priest watches them go, and then returns to his duties with the wounded. \n65   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                            65 The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of her there might be many a bleak night in her convent when she will remember the image, and that same smile will return to her lips. \n66   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                         66 \nThe Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier. He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it. He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald. SOLDIER My name is Peter... don't forget ... tell everybody that was my name... Peter... Ronald is mumbling his prayers. PRIEST Lie still, Peter... \nSOLDIER That's it, Peter... tell everybody ... write it... don't forget it... Peter... tell them Peter died here ... my name is Peter... Peter... say it again. \nRonald stays with the boy as he struggles against his own annihilation. PRIEST Peter... \nRonald behaves well with the dying boy. \n67   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                     67 The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest, if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre- tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep. \n68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68 In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration. \nHe steps over her and settles into his own space by the window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of sleep. The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           * cloak over his head. \n73   CONTINUED:                                                    73 Hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream. Soon they have covered his head completely with stones, his body lying exposed. HECTOR It's all we can do. It won't keep the wolves away though. \nBeatrice is still taken by the boy's shoes. BEATRICE His feet are like mine, you know. I'll give you mine, poor boy, and I'll have yours. I have more walking to do. \nShe looks at Hector. BEATRICE It's not stealing if I give him mine, is it? Hector watches as Beatrice exchanges her old shoes for the squire's. They fit her well, and she proudly shows them off to Hector. He smiles at her. \n74   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                             74 \nLater, Hector and Beatrice are enjoying each other immensely, making love by the stream. Beatrice hasn't removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. She is dabbing Hector with her perfume which, he has discovered, she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain around her neck. Nearby the corpse of   the squire still lies, its head shrouded in stones,   as if absurdly hiding its eyes from the antics of Hector   and Beatrice. The old shoes Beatrice has placed   on its feet look odd compared to the fine uniform.                                                  * \nHector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of their situation, but perhaps it only looks strange to our modern eyes. \nHector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma. HECTOR You've put magic in this stuff, haven't you, you're bewitching me... They appear to get the gist of one another's love talk. \n(CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:                                                    74 BEATRICE You're eager today, Hector, aren't you? Is it all this death? HECTOR I don't know what you're saying but I like you when you talk. \n75   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                           75 \nHector is watching Beatrice conduct some kind of ceremony over the corpse of the squire. She takes a handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she walks around the corpse three times, scattering the leaves over the body. Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches from a safe distance. During the few moments that it takes, Beatrice seems like a different person. Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few drops of her perfume over the body. She smiles.                    * BEATRICE That should help him a little. \nHECTOR We should go now. We've been here too long. BEATRICE I wonder if his mama will ever know what happened. \nHECTOR You said mama. I know what that is... mama... We can talk the same... \nBEATRICE Mama... that's right... mama... \n76   EXT. HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                           76   * They have reached the summit   of the hills. It is like the roof of the world. Below    them lies the valley. The air is clean. The landscape    looks untouched by man, but a few smudges of smoke in   the distance suggest farms or villages. There might be    the glimpse of a castle on a hill. \n(CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:                                                  76 If it all feels oddly familiar to us, then perhaps it is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not from a dream, but in a dream. \nThe moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of Hector and Beatrice. HECTOR I have to keep the sun on my back, that's what Ronald said... the sun on my back all the way home... I'll stay on this side of the river... \nBEATRICE Yes, of course... we stay on this side of the river, all the way down... until tomorrow... HECTOR I stay on this side... \nBEATRICE Yes... On this side. Then the other. They move off, each thinking that they have reached agreement. Beatrice starts to sing as they make a                * gentle descent into the forests below. \n77   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           77 Beatrice is milking a stray cow they have found in the forest. Hector is watching her, especially her hands. She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily. Her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of their own. She is chattering non-stop, explaining the            * subtleties of milking to Hector. But he can't take his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands. He responds distractedly.                                           * HECTOR Oh yes... oh yes. \n78   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          78 \nHector lies by their small fire, watching Beatrice, who sleeps by his side. She is dreaming. She mumbles in her sleep, whole sentences. She turns this way and that. Hector watches in fascination. \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                   78 We feel the echo of another night when a man watched someone sleep and dream. \nHe handles some of the things spilling from her bag, lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or simply an early version of a cluttered handbag? \nWe don't know what is passing through Hector's mind. Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his side. And how many people have done that through the ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms? There are many ways in which we will be able to connect with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home, huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as we all are. \nHector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't know what to do. Eventually he speaks.                               * \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                     85 HECTOR Is there water... to drink... to wash? He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he wants some breathing space. She talks to her son. \nBEATRICE Take Hector to the well... but come here first. \nShe takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little dance in them before leaving with Hector. \n86   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                86 Hector stands at the well some way from the house. Beatrice's garden is a madness of wild flowers, harvested by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable woman, living as she does in the harsh male world of her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze. He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some decisions to   make. \n87   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                             87 The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of embarrassment. HECTOR No, no... sit down... I just came to watch... please... sit... He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily. \n(CONTINUED) \n87   CONTINUED:                                                    87 MOTHER We can't have this... this was Arnaud's seat... it's yours now... I can sit on the box... Hector gently pacifies her. \nHECTOR You must sit there... look... you need the light from the window... it's your seat... I don't want it... it's yours... I can sit on the box. The old woman   allows herself a shy smile. Whether in innocence or   mischief, she has secured the best seat in the house for   herself. If he stays, Hector will never dare rest his   bones in it. \n88   EXT. YARD - DAY                                               88 Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a large jar of colored liquid. Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere. This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes meet briefly. Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness. He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant. \nHECTOR Ah... The Boy says something and points towards his sister. She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid. Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron. HECTOR Good color... for cloth? \nWithout thinking, Hector leans over the cauldron to sniff. A hideous odor assaults him. He backs off. (CONTINUED) \n88   CONTINUED:                                                    88 HECTOR Ugh... \nThe Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like the word \"peepee.\" \nHECTOR Peepee? The Girl nods enthusiastically.      The Boy is sniggering. \n89   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            89 \nHector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family. There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as a future father. The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's house there is the luxury of small individual plates. The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with food. There is definitely some power play going on in the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence. Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food. The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly and methodically. She is an eating machine. During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But this time their talking without words is a serious affair. HECTOR Mmmm... good food.... \n90   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            90 \nFrom the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden. he is making an effort to appear relaxed, but as he paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy. She leaves the kitchen to join him. \nBEATRICE Take a walk to the village if you want... you look as if you need a walk... \nHector opens his heart to her, knowing she will understand his feelings if not his words. \n(CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED:                                                        90 HECTOR I have to leave soon. I can't stay... it would be wrong to stay for just a while... \n91   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                                91 \nIt is awkward for Hector to say goodbye. HECTOR I have to go... have to keep the sun on my back... I have to get home... I have a family, just like you... I like you... you                             * smell good... wonderful... \nHector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks off down the track. He turns to look at Beatrice. She stands outside her house for a long time, watching him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT. The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless. Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth? It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one. \nHECTOR Some bread and raisins. \nFRANCISCO I thought everything was shared out on the raft... \nHECTOR Well this wasn't. It's for her... and you. Francisco looks Hector straight  in the eye, looking for his angle. But this time there   is none. Hector is simply a lonely man seeking to  retrieve lost friendship. There is a glimmer of sympathy  in Francisco's face. (CONTINUED) \n103   CONTINUED:                                                    103 On the high dunes the Slave and the natives have now parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end of their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet. Francisco walks away from him.      Hector calls out. \nHECTOR I must speak to her! \n104   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               104 \nThe Slave approaches Dom Paulo outside his tent. SLAVE They want to make a visit here... with their King... he will bring gifts, and will receive gifts. They said not to sacrifice anymore                     * men for them... they don't like that... Dom Paulo and the others laugh. \n105   EXT. BAY - DAY                                                105 The tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay. Barrels and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the sea.                                                                * The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             * in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man- handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             * to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     * By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in crate after crate. An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo. \nOFFICER Turtles' eggs, sir... Doctor Correa was shipping them to the Royal Zoo... I think they hoped some of them would hatch. \nDOM PAULO Well... it's eggs for supper tonight... for everyone...                             * \n106   EXT. CAMP - DUSK                                           106 That night everyone does eat turtles' eggs. At their fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them, scramble them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the afternoon has survived into the night. For once there is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be heard.                                                           * \n107   INT. HECTOR'S TENT - DUSK                                  107 Sadly for Hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent. Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them outside to his fire. \n108   EXT. CAMP - DUSK                                           108 Andre is there eating the last of his omelette. HECTOR How are they? ANDRE Good. \nHector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan. Inside          * is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust. Hector            * grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is discolored and the smell is rank. Hector looks at Andre, rapidly finishing his omelette before Hector can demand          * it. HECTOR Yours were fine? ANDRE Yes. \nHector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his ear. It seems as empty as the other two.  He picks up a fourth egg and cracks it open. A small dried-up, half- formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan. Andre is quietly enjoying Hector's frustration. He stands up to leave. ANDRE Good night. \n(CONTINUED) \n108   CONTINUED:                                                     108 HECTOR Have you any eggs left? \nANDRE The slaves only got three.    I want to ask you something. \nHECTOR You were lucky. What? ANDRE I want my real name back. HECTOR You don't like Andre anymore? \nANDRE I think of my home all the time. I want to hear the name they call me. We should die with our real names. HECTOR We're not going to die, Andre... Hector smiles at his own insensitivity. HECTOR I've forgotten your name... ANDRE Ketabomago Pululo. HECTOR Now I remember why we called you Andre. \nAndre looks at him expectantly. HECTOR I will, Andre... I promise... I'll call you that... when I remember... Andre is satisfied, and leaves.      Hector calls to him. \nHECTOR Good night... Keta... ANDRE Ketabomago Pululo... \nHECTOR Yes... good night... (CONTINUED) \n108   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              108 Hector is alone. Hector gives up on the eggs and pulls               * out his store of bread and fruit from the tent. The                  * next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the HARMONIUM. He shouts across to the musical enthusiast, a YOUTH with a few older children by his side. \nHECTOR Hey! Stop that, will you? Think of the older people, and the sick... I'll give you an egg if                         * you stop... here... \n109   EXT. CAMP - NEXT MORNING                                       109 \nThe Officers and Dom Paulo are selecting items for barter            * from their crates and boxes of valuables. Hector and other notables are also there. Cheap goods, a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of                * common beads, for example, are being gone through and suitable junk selected for gifts. They talk as they work. DOM PAULO How many are sick? DA CUNHA About fifty, sir, some of them very sick indeed. It's the eggs. A couple of the crates were full of                     * rotten ones, but eaten just the                         * same. Others just ate too many. It would have been better to ration them, I suppose. DOM PAULO How wise of you to think of that now. Any deaths? DA CUNHA Six. \nDom Paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap rosary from around his neck and offers it to the King. DOM PAULO I shouldn't do this, but it is such a special occasion, and he is such a great and worthy King... This is translated.    The King refuses to accept the               * rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which he has forgotten to   remove. SLAVE He says he could not accept such a treasured gift, something of such value to your family... instead he would be happy to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers... but please do not insist that he take your necklace... It is impossible to know if the King is being naively polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles around his own neck. The King begins talking again. The Slave translates. \nSLAVE He will give you guides to help                        * you across the first of the big rivers... it is ten days from here... (CONTINUED) \n113   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             113 DOM PAULO Thank you, thank you... \nThe Slave continues. SLAVE ... and he asks you to be ready to leave the beach in two days time... he cannot permit you to stay longer... \nDom Paulo looks shocked. SLAVE Because with the new moon the turtles will arrive and lay their eggs... you may frighten them... you must be gone... The mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs of most of the survivors, even the fit ones. The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               * Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost- looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if ever there was. \n114   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                          114 The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large fire the survivors have made on the beach. Small groups of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh. The image is once again timeless, the elements of it simple; man, fire, flesh, food. One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people. Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle. They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be. \nHector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly at the fire, licking his fingers. Hector sits down in the sand beside him. Nuno hardly notices him until Hector offers him one of his bones. Nuno grabs it. \nNUNO Thanks. \n(CONTINUED) \n114   CONTINUED:                                                     114 HECTOR Suck out the marrow... it's the best bit. Nuno follows Hector's example. Hector allows him to feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk. \nHECTOR I'm sorry about today... NUNO It doesn't matter... HECTOR But it does... it was mean of me... I was upset at something... I wasn't really angry at you... NUNO I know. Nuno is taking it rather well.      Hector regains his natural self-confidence.                                             * HECTOR You don't think too badly of me? NUNO No... HECTOR You still like me? Nuno shyly nods his head. HECTOR You do? \nNUNO Yes. \nHector is satisfied now. HECTOR Well, that makes me feel better... we all have to like each other... and respect each other... that's important too. They are silent for a moment. \nHECTOR If you don't respect me, just say so... \n(CONTINUED) \n114   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              114 Nuno looks at him, smiling weakly. Then he turns away in silence. Hector tries another approach to win the Boy over. HECTOR I have a boy like you... maybe                          * you could meet him when we get home... This doesn't produce much of a response. Hector tries again. He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno in the ribs. HECTOR You can take her back there tomorrow, eh? \nNuno shakes his head. NUNO No... she's sick now... \n115   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                              115 Dom Paulo and the Priest and some of the Officers are having a more formal meal at Dom Paulo's table outside his shelter. An argument is in progress between Dom Paulo and GASPAR DIAS, the navigator. Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the table. DOM PAULO Can't you be more accurate? Hector comes to the meeting. He sits down on a box near the table and watches and listens, his expression changing with the shifts in mood of the others. This                 * is Hector the social animal, our Hector with his pockets             * full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of food. DIAS How can I be accurate without instruments? As it is I'm sighting the sun with two pieces of wood... Call it five hundred and be done with it... he said                          * twenty rivers.                                          * \n(CONTINUED) \n115   CONTINUED:                                                      115 DOM PAULO We just want you to be as accurate as we know you can be, Dias. After all, the ship did manage to find that rock with admirable precision. \nDIAS Confound you, Dom Paulo, that's an insult... she hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable... She was overloaded before she left India and you know it.... Dias pounds his fist on the table. \nDIAS I've told   you... we vote for a                         * leader or   you can walk into the jungle on   your own... it should have been   done days ago... DA CUNHA Calm down, Dias... you can't stay here forever, living on turtles' eggs... There are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it. The tension for the moment is broken.                                 * DA CUNHA What about the sick and the injured, Dom Paulo...? \nDom Paulo lets out a heavy sigh. DOM PAULO I've discussed it with Father Diogo... I don't see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick... \nFATHER DIOGO I'm going to search the scriptures tonight. I'm sure that God has an answer to it. \nDIAS An excuse, you mean... we'll be leaving them here to die... \nSALGADO Oh, so you're coming with us now, Dias! (CONTINUED) \n115   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              115 Dias mumbles to himself. \nHECTOR And afterwards... what will you do then? \nNUNO Follow you and the others. HECTOR Alone? \nNuno remains silent. ANDRE Let him be. \n122   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               122 Dom Paulo and Father Diogo are standing beside Dom                    * Paulo's table, all that remains of his headquarters on                * the beach. \nFATHER DIOGO I'll comfort them as best as I can. DOM PAULO You're staying with them? Father Diogo hastens to correct this misunderstanding. \nFATHER DIOGO No, no, I'll comfort them before we leave. I think my place is with you... Two sailors, like stagehands, enter and remove the table, leaving Dom Paulo and Father Diogo propless on the beach. \n123   EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY                                        123 The trek from the beach to the village has started. A long line of people, including some local natives, carry the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short trip is hard.  Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the harmonium up the jungle path. \n(CONTINUED) \n123   CONTINUED:                                                    123 Just behind   them Hector is helping Nuno to carry his Mother in a   litter. It is like a civilization on the move. In a    day or two the wind and the sea will have rubbed out   all evidence of their stay, and the bay will welcome its   regular tenants, the turtles. \n124   EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY                                   124 There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the European sick are settled into their huts and the others prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take place in                * dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved sailors are playing cards in the dirt.                              * \nIn amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco. He finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut.             * HECTOR Francisco... I have to see her                         * before we leave. FRANCISCO I'll ask her. Francisco goes into the hut. Hector waits outside, watching the small human dramas all around him. Soon Francisco emerges from the hut. \nFRANCISCO In you go. Hector goes into the hut, stooping low at the small entrance. \n125   INT. HUT - DAY                                              125 \nUrsula is lying in a darkened corner. Hector is shaken by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to show it. He kneels beside her. \nHECTOR Ursula... it's Hector. \nShe turns her eyes to him but doesn't speak. \nHECTOR We're leaving soon. I've come to say goodbye... \nHer voice is a whisper. (CONTINUED) \n125   CONTINUED:                                                       125 URSULA Goodbye. \nHECTOR I won't forget you... I won't forget India... I can't forget how I hurt you... \nShe looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak. HECTOR We should have talked... I could have explained... many things... She manages a whispered word. \nURSULA Lisbon... HECTOR Yes... I'll pray for you in Lisbon... at the Cathedral... She lies still.       Hector lingers for a moment.   Then he speaks again. HECTOR I'm sorry I hurt your pride... \nHector has blown it. Ursula pulls herself up on an elbow, finding wells of energy from sheer indignation. Hector is astonished, almost jumping out of his skin. URSULA What? What did you say?    What are you talking about? \nHECTOR Nothing, nothing... Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead faint. URSULA Idiot! \nShe lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she is still breathing. He whispers nervously. HECTOR Ursula? \n126   EXT. HUT - DAY                                             126 Outside the hut, Dom Paulo is talking with Francisco. \nDOM PAULO We won't forget you, or what you are doing for these poor people... \n129   EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY                                           129 Hector has scoured the campsite.      He holds up a canteen he has found. \nHECTOR It's Sandy's... whiskey... BOBBY Well done, my lad! Hector walks to the fire, pleased with     himself. Bobby unfolds his fist and looks at what he     has found, an Indian arrowhead with a few inches of     broken shaft. He folds his hand over it again, keeping     his secret. Behind them, nailed to a tree, is a plaque their companions have left. It reads, \"Pennsylvania Boundary Expedition 1761, Marker 152.\" Also on the plaque someone has written, \"We left here, 20th October.\" \n130   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             130 Hector and Bobby sit by the fire with their supper.      They are both anxious, but pretend not to be. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:                                                 130 BOBBY Even if we lose their track, we'll still hit the river... we can't miss that. HECTOR It's too high for Indians? \nBOBBY Much too high. You won't find an Indian up here. We just have to keep our heads... no panic. HECTOR If you did find an Indian, what would he be? \nBOBBY You wouldn't... but he might be a Delaware if you did. HECTOR We keep working? \nBOBBY Why not. We can log the peaks on the far side, just a couple of sightings a day... keep us busy... \nTheir forced tone of matter-of-factness only serves to heighten the growing feeling of doom. HECTOR You think we'll get out? BOBBY If we keep our heads.   I wish I had some tobacco. \n131   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                        131 \nHector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon become aware of them and move off. He is worried about something else. From under the pack that makes his pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it, then looks back to Bobby and the wolf. \n132   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                        132 In the morning Hector and Bobby are taking readings from the instruments they have hung on a large tree, main- taining the disciplines of their work. It gives some shape and meaning to their predicament. BOBBY Barometer... twenty-eight and three-eighths... temperature...                        * low... thirty-four... high... forty-two and a half... time... \nHector writes it in the log book. Bobby goes to the              * horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped to the saddle. Hector takes out a smaller chronometer from his own pack. They compare readings. There is a difference of some four or five minutes in the time. \nBOBBY It's getting worse... you're nearly five minutes fast now... HECTOR I'm not fast... you're slowing down. They obviously have this tiff every morning. HECTOR What's the point of having two chronometers when you don't take the average? BOBBY Exactly... you should throw yours away. HECTOR You're unscientific, Bobby... at heart... Hector writes in the book.   He speaks pointedly. \nHECTOR Seven twenty-five... \nBobby mocks him with a laugh.                                    * \n133   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          133 \nBobby is leading the horse and Hector walks on ahead.            * The going is easy through the ferns and grasses. Bobby           * for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing loudly. \n(CONTINUED) \n133   CONTINUED:                                                    133 BOBBY I see her in the dewy flowers I see her sweet and fair... His voice rings sharply around the forest. Hector far ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath. BOBBY There's not a bonny bird that sings But minds me o' my Jean... \n134   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                        134 \nHector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock looking out across the broad valley. They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in the name of science. They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn. They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they work. \nWhen they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest. It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley. HECTOR Sure this is a good idea. \nBOBBY Let's get out of here. \nThey hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic. \n135   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          135 \nThey are travelling together now, on either side of the horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each other. They stop for Bobby to consult his compass. \n140   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          140 They are making a round frame of bent branches and cover- ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in the undergrowth, it is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they feel the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide. \n141   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          141 \nThey are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud. BOBBY Maybe he's lost too... on his own... must be Delaware... they were chased up here years ago... everybody thought they'd cleared off west... the other side of Ohio... they were an angry lot... no wonder... they used to farm on the coast. He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile. BOBBY Go on, read it out... Hector looks up. HECTOR What?     No... not tonight... BOBBY I've had to listen to it every night since April... why not now? \nHector gives in. He holds a scrap of paper close to the candle and reads. HECTOR Dear, Father, I miss you. Three frogs are dead. Everybody misses you.  Bring me a bear's head and claws and a gun. School is good. Miss White has married a fireman. Come back soon. Do not worry about the frogs, they did not have names. Nathaniel. \nHector looks up at Bobby. \nHECTOR It's not so funny now as it was. \n(CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:                                                     141 BOBBY It wasn't funny then. \nHECTOR If you knew him... if you could picture him saying it... it would be funnier. \nBOBBY I had a father like you... nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us... HECTOR I'm going home, for the winter... \nBobby doesn't pursue his argument.    He tenses, then sniffs the air vigorously. BOBBY Smell it? HECTOR No. BOBBY Goddam it... smell it? \nHector sniffs some more. HECTOR Tobacco? \nThey whisper. BOBBY Where the hell is it coming from? He puts his head out of the shelter. \nBOBBY I can't tell... a night like this it could carry for miles... \nHe huddles back inside the shelter. BOBBY I wish I had a smoke. \n(CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              141 After a tense silence, Hector takes a small package from an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby. \nHECTOR I was saving it... you have it... \nIt is a wedge of tobacco.      Bobby takes it. \nBOBBY What do you mean, you were saving it? You know the rules... no hoarding, tobacco or food... you've listened to me for a month, day and night... wanting a smoke... \nHECTOR Well have it now... I don't smoke... take it... BOBBY You've kept it from me, and you don't even use it... HECTOR I was saving it for my birthday... I was going to give it to you then... BOBBY I have to wait until your birthday for a smoke? Who are you... the fucking king? HECTOR Go on, smoke it... have it now... BOBBY I bloody won't... I'm not smoking on your command... I bloody won't. There is a brooding silence. \nBOBBY God,   your poor children... what do they   have to do for a piece of candy   in your house? It's very hard   to like you sometimes... d'you know   that? HECTOR I know, Bobby... but that's how I feel about you, too... that's why we're friends... we try hard... come on... smoke your pipe... (CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                141 Hector is neatly turning the tables on Bobby, who now appears churlish, childish. \nBOBBY No... I'll have it in the morning. \nHECTOR Come on... tell me... who would you rather be sitting here with... have a think... \nBobby does, and then breaks into a smile. BOBBY Daniel Boone? \nHector smiles, too. HECTOR Yeah. He would be a help... but after Daniel Boone... BOBBY I can't think of anyone else... but you're impossible to like sometimes. Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy. BOBBY We should sleep. We've got a lot of running to do in the morning. But Hector has other plans.          He is in control of their friendship now. HECTOR No we're not... we're going to talk... all night... Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable smile we have yet seen on his face. \nCAMERAMAN Look here for a second, will you, Mr. Troup? REPORTER #1 Will you talk to us when you come out? (CONTINUED) \n145   CONTINUED:                                                    145 Hector enters the building. The media mob immediately switch off their energy. They light cigarettes, fiddle              * with cameras, stare into space, as if someone has shouted \"Cut.\" \n146   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         146 \nHector climbs to the fourth floor.     A POLICEMAN goes with him. \nTwo paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a stretcher. The Policeman stops. POLICEMAN You guys are downstairs... third floor... thirty-eight... The paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs. Hector looks at the Policeman curiously. POLICEMAN You're forty-eight. \nThey continue climbing. \n147   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                        147 \nHector and the Policeman squeeze past a cluster of people at the door and enter the apartment. POLICEMAN This is Troup! A DETECTIVE is with another man who looks like a city official. \nDETECTIVE Come here, Troup. I'm Cobb. \nHector joins them. DETECTIVE You bring everything? \nHECTOR What? DETECTIVE Building warrant, license, fire certificate, sanitation certificate... I want them all... This is Mr. Santiago, from the city... insurance...

I have to leave town in an hour                          * or so anyway... \nDETECTIVE Slow down, Troup... so it's 3:15 on a Friday... you're staying here 'til Mr. Santiago gets the paperwork... get your partner over here, with everything... this is serious... \nHector looks at his watch. \nHECTOR MR. SANTIAGO I might have to close the place down. \nHECTOR Where is she? The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below, surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over the rim of the hole. She looks angry. MR. PHILIPPOPOLIS I phoned you Monday... I told you the floor was making noises... HECTOR Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis... my ex-partner... I think you spoke                          * to him... How are you feeling? Hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the Detective and Mr. Santiago. The Detecitve is unimpressed. \nDETECTIVE Come back from there, Troup, the floor's still moving... \n(CONTINUED) \n147   CONTINUED:     (2)                                          147 HECTOR I'll make a couple of calls... I'll straighten it out... is she bad? Why don't they move her? DETECTIVE They waited for a portable X-Ray machine... they can move her now. HECTOR She seems in good spirits... \nAs if in response, Mrs. Philippopolis shouts up to Hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her. \nMRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS Wait 'til my son sees his mother lying here like this... he's gonna sue you... you're a lousy landlord... you should be ashamed... to let old people live like this... I phoned you Monday... I have a witness! I was dancing with a prince on my eighteenth birthday, and now look at me... you have me falling down a toilet! \n148   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         148 Hector retreats into the hallway. Takes out his mobile phone and dials, while watching the ominous Mr. Santiago making copius notes in his book. Hector gets connected. \nHECTOR Boris... why did you do this to me? Get down here now... they want all kinds of certificates... They won't let me leave the building... I have my kids tonight, I haven't seen them in four years... I did tell you, I've been talking about it all week... how come they phoned me, this isn't my building? What? Don't tell me anymore... I want you here, now... and on your knee... I'll phone the lawyer... but you move. My weekend's ruined before it's started. \nHector quickly dials another number. \n(CONTINUED) \n148   CONTINUED:                                                    148 HECTOR Anna... thank God... you have to help me...

Please... right... okay... \nHe finishes the call just as Santiago approaches, waving his notebook now full of incriminating notes. SANTIAGO It looks like water rotted the floor... You have any plumbing maintenance records? HECTOR At the office... I might have some bills... it's not my building.                         * Santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the mundane mechanics of Hector's building. SANTIAGO It's a weird one... I don't know how water could sit in there for so long without somebody noticing ... you didn't use water-resistent paint on the ceilings did you? \nHECTOR Let's go. \n155   INT./EXT. CAR - DUSK                                         155 They are driving on the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is on the telephone again. He can't let go of business. HECTOR Excuse me, kids... I have to consult the oracle... \nHe gets connected. HECTOR Hello... God? No, Leonard, it's Hector... just a joke... sorry to phone you at home, did Boris call you? The insurance is fine? Good ... but she could claim negligence ... oh, she's got a lawyer already? That's a bad omen... Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for clues about this virtual stranger in front of them. HECTOR Is there anything we can do right now... make her an offer... Sure, with the insurance company... sure... you're right... me, too... I have the kids in the car with me right now... sorry to bother you... 'bye... \n(CONTINUED) \n155   CONTINUED:                                                       155 Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror. Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them. He smiles and puts on an act of brightness. \nHECTOR That's it! The last call... the weekend starts right now... we have things to do... look out for a Safeway... we need some supplies... and gas... oh my God, gas... soon... They return his look with blank expressions.        He picks up the phone and offers it to them. \nHECTOR Want to make any calls?    Betsy? She shakes her head. HECTOR Tom? TOM No... and it's Thomas... HECTOR But we called you Tom... that's what it says on your birth certificate... THOMAS (TOM) I changed it. Hector wisely lets it go. \nHECTOR Right... it's your name... you                            * can do that... Safeway... keep your                       * eyes skinned... and I could murder                        * a Chicken McNugget.                                       * \n156   INT. SAFEWAY - NIGHT                                           156 \nHector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway. The place is almost deserted. Betsy and Thomas are tagging along. \n(CONTINUED) \n156   CONTINUED:                                                      156 For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he makes a stand. He turns to face her. \nHECTOR What's wrong with that? It's a kitchen roll... why can't I pick a kitchen roll? \nBetsy is defiant. BETSY It's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk... She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the sense to back down. HECTOR Good point, Betsy... Betsy keeps on the attack. BETSY Everything you buy is junk... I don't eat steak... and what's this... She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers. \nBETSY Ugh! Why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it... A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice. Hector warms to her. \nHECTOR You're right. \nHector pushes the cart to her. \nHECTOR Well, get to it... I'll just tag along... \nBetsy moves off with the cart. BETSY I do it every week anyway. (CONTINUED) \n156   CONTINUED:    (2)                                          156 Thomas backs her up. \nTHOMAS She does. She tells us what to eat. We let her. \nHector follows them up the aisle. \nHECTOR Can I just keep a couple of those steaks? We can't live on chicken.                   * \n157   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157 \nHector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the back of the car the kids have watched it all. Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car. \n158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158 Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep, searching for some traces of the little children that have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots he abandoned. \n159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159 \n(CONTINUED) \n163   CONTINUED:                                                      163 HECTOR It comes up every year? \nBETSY The last two. \n164   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               164 They are on the beach, walking in the direction of town. Hector strides ahead in a show of enthusiasm, although awkward in Donald's big shoes. The kids trail behind. He calls back to them. HECTOR Where are the birds?    Is it the wrong time of year? BETSY They don't come over so much. The shellfish have gone... that's what... HECTOR That's what Donald says? BETSY Yes... and it happens to be true. \nHector looks at the sky.       He speaks quietly to himself. HECTOR Please don't rain... please... \n165   EXT. FUNFAIR - DAY                                             165 \nThe light DRIZZLE now falling is keeping away what few                * fun-seekers there are left in town. The Funfair is not much fun. It is the end of the season. Hector and the                 * kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys. The kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back at Hector for four years of neglect. Heavy-hearted, Hector still tries to make a go of it. \nHECTOR Let's have a ride... He has stopped at some dated space rockets. \nBETSY The seats are wet. Hector triumphs. He pulls a wad of kitchen roll from his pocket and starts to wipe the seats. (CONTINUED) \n165   CONTINUED:                                                     165 HECTOR Kitchen roll, unbleached, re-cycled, biodegradable... dry seats... Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb aboard the rockets. \nAs the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he has to do something to break the awful distance between him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom? Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence, her stoicism, her patience, her courage. It moves him. He leans over to her. HECTOR This is ridiculous. Let's go somewhere and talk. Betsy smiles her small patient smile. BETSY All right, if you want to... Hector looks to Thomas. Thomas vigorously nods his agreement. Hector is happier. He looks down on the decrepit fairground. \nHECTOR How do we land these things? \n166   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                       166 The only place the small town has to offer is a deserted coffee shop on the shorefront. Hector, Betsy and Thomas sit at a corner table, beyond them through the window is the beach and the ocean. \nHECTOR Sure you won't have a pancake,                          * Betsy?                                                  * Betsy gets impatient.                                                * \nBETSY                                      * No!                                                     * (CONTINUED) \n166   CONTINUED:                                                       166 HECTOR Okay, first question?                                     * \nThe kids are ready for this.        There is no coyness now. THOMAS Where have you been? \nBETSY What he means is why did you stay away? \nHector begins like a story-teller embarking on a long saga. \nHECTOR Well, that's a fair question... your mother and I got divorced... you're big enough to remember... she must have told you all that? BETSY Sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear... HECTOR You're right... what can I tell you... I went kind of crazy after that, for a good while... I came around a few times... remember? THOMAS Not really. HECTOR Well, it wasn't easy... everything with her and Donald happened pretty quickly. I missed you both really badly... but for a while I thought I should stay away, until your mother got settled... no, that's not really true... I missed you... but I was kind of crazy at the same time... your mother and I married young... I wasn't used to the freedom... it went to my head ... then you moved to New Jersey. (CONTINUED) \n166   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             166 BETSY It's forty minutes away on a slow bus... HECTOR You're right, you're right. I don't have too many excuses for the first year... the second year is easier... I was in jail. Hector is pleased with this.       A solid excuse. \nTHOMAS What for? \nHECTOR We were doing government work, big contracts... there were some temptations... my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers... there was a lot of money in it... I had to testify against him... it was like killing somebody. \nHector thinks about this, remembering the pain. For us there is the echo of the real killing that was done long ago. BETSY Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.                        * Hector looks at Thomas. \nHECTOR You did? \nThomas nods proudly. HECTOR Well I appreciate that... but I'm glad your mother didn't let you. I'll tell you all about it some day.  It was no fun. One year and eight months. \nTHOMAS We didn't even know when you got out. \nBETSY Sure. HECTOR You'll be there, right beside me? BETSY I'd have to take the morning off school. HECTOR Is that bad? \nBETSY No, that could be good... \nBetsy and Hector are quite close now. \nHECTOR Just tell them you were with your invisible dad. \n168   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                             168 Hector and Betsy are walking on the shore.     Thomas tags along behind them. \nBETSY What's she like? How did you meet her? \nHECTOR The funny thing is I fell in love with her before I ever saw her... I smelled her... It was the day I got out of jail... I was on the train and she was sitting behind me... it was just this incredible perfume... remember I'd been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males... She got off the train and I followed her... I couldn't help it... that's how good she is... she listened to a bum who followed her off a train... Betsy looks at him kindly. HECTOR ... but she's still going to kill me on Monday... \nThey share a laugh.   Betsy looks out to the ocean. BETSY I think I'll paint the sunset tonight. HECTOR It's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it? Betsy doesn't take the bait.   There is a silence. \nHECTOR I remember when you two were tiny.. I used to watch you sleeping... it was like now... I felt close to you, could touch you... but you weren't there... you were gone... dreamland ... just when I was closest to you, you weren't there... I felt it last night, too. \nBETSY That's what it's like... you should know that. \n(CONTINUED) \n168   CONTINUED:                                                     168 HECTOR I'm not smart about things like that, usually. BETSY Don't be so tough on yourself. You seem to want to be... you don't have to... HECTOR No? \nBETSY No... we can do that... \nShe smiles. Hector is out of his depth with this daughter of his. HECTOR Is that a joke? BETSY No, I mean it... look out for yourself... Hector looks at her in wonderment. One of those moments when another human being stands before you and is an utter mystery. \nHECTOR Who are you?   Who's inside there? BETSY You'll never know. Future generations of women are going to be just as unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails after her, hooked. \n169   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              169 Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat, some distance from the shore. They are watching Hector who is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach. Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one is making a fire for the barbecue. These human rituals never stop. \nBETSY I thought he was taller. (CONTINUED) \n169   CONTINUED:                                                        169 THOMAS Well, it's been a while... you're bigger. BETSY I suppose so. He's getting fat, too. I bet I could beat him at the breast-stroke now. \n170   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                              170 \nHector turns from his work. Out at sea the kids look small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to them. \nHECTOR Come on in, kids... that boat doesn't look too safe... They call back to him. BETSY We're fine! Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the confidence yet, or something. He is edgy. \nHECTOR I've just found you... I don't want to lose you. What would I tell your mother... come on in... \nHe walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks. Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls to Thomas. HECTOR Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll pull you in. Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh. HECTOR This is one useless piece of rope, Thomas... \nJust for a moment we have the image of our     Hector standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe. \n171   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                          171 At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on the beach. It's like action painting. She works frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose patience with the sun. \nBETSY Why does it always go so fast...? Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out. \nThe sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then he becomes a little self-conscious. HECTOR I used to know how to do this... \n", "test1_input": "HERMAS If you want to do it  again, you need another chicken  and another fifteen sesterces...  and I'd like the first fifteen now  please. Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas. \n27   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           27 Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage. \nLucinnius is still in a talking mood.   His troubles won't allow him to relax. LUCINNIUS Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships... I'm                           * finished. Just when things were going well... I had plans for you too, Hector... in four or five years I was going to make you a free man... and then in ten years                       * you'd be a citizen... you... you                        * could've found your family... brought them here... everything... \nHector smiles ruefully. HECTOR It sounds good. Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses about his own future generosity. LUCINNIUS It does, doesn't it! Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to            * rub his shoulders. LUCINNIUS I shouldn't give up. I can't... I'll visit Cyprian, first thing tomorrow... before the others can get to him... he's got to see reason... I can pay him back... sometime. It's the only chance we have, Hector. Should I do it? HECTOR You must. LUCINNIUS You're right.    I must. \nThis burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense muscles yield more to Hector's fingers. THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius watches her. (CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 LUCINNIUS Thalia, I think I need one of your massages. Hector, you can                       * finish the lamps. Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius as he closes the door. LUCINNIUS Lower, Thalia. \n28   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28 \nLate at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him, some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed- room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a master's privilege. \n29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29 In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage, Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall. He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his head. \n30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30 Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof. In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He moves towards it. The figure speaks. \nFIGURE I missed you last night. It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.      Hector sits down beside her. \nHECTOR He kept me working until morning. \nTHALIA What's happening? (CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                                     30 HECTOR He has no money and a lot of enemies. If he's very clever he'll survive... but the omens are bad... and he's not very clever. \nTHALIA She doesn't like him. HECTOR Nobody does. He's unfortunate. You get people like that. Clumsy and sad. Thalia looks out towards the sea. \nTHALIA Why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean? Hector puts an arm around Thalia. At first it feels                 * strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter- of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place where they can be themselves. HECTOR It's the Gods arguing. They're working out what to do with Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake down there... wondering what they're saying about him. \nThey laugh.    Far away some street DOGS BARK. HECTOR If he goes down I'll ask for my freedom... he owes it to me... he said as much... you too... we could be free... \nTHALIA Then what? HECTOR What we talk about. \nBy now he is kissing her. (CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                30 THALIA We talk about going home. Yours is that way and mine is that way... your family is that way. HECTOR I just made that up... I don't                           * know which way they are... anyway                        * ... you can't think like that.                           * Not after so many years...                               * \nTHALIA It's what you talk about. HECTOR We talk about it because it can                          * never happen. What we do is you                          * and me... THALIA I don't understand. I think you'll leave. You're going to leave me here. \nHECTOR Never. It's you and me now. That's all. THALIA Well.   We stay here.   He'll survive.                   * Hector is silent, still kissing her.      He yawns as he              * speaks. \nHECTOR Then I can see you every night. I'm tired. \n31   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31 \nHector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him, whispering. \nLUCINNIUS I can't sleep. Get me a chicken. I want to make another sacrifice. We'll do it ourselves. \nHector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows Lucinnius out of the room. \n", "test1_true": "MAN Can't you find a woman, Hector... Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves have their meeting places scattered all over the house. HECTOR Sorry to trouble you... just fetching a chicken... good night ... the roof's free... The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms. HECTOR Come on, miss, you can tell Lucinnius his future. \n33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33 Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian. Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master, and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but there is already activity around the house, visitors coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor- tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves. Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial Mr. Big. \n34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34 The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds. \nHector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching her child from a distance on its first day at school. (CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:                                                     34 Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself. Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits. The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door. One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian. \nEventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him. HECTOR You look happier. \nLUCINNIUS Relieved anyway... relieved that it's over at last. Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector following after him. \n35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35 \nLucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they can talk. \nHECTOR Will he help you? \nLUCINNIUS I have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. He has all my letters to Titinius, none of them got through. He says it's like treason... and he says I should want to die for owing him half a million anyway... \nHector is shocked. \nHECTOR What if you don't... \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 LUCINNIUS Then he will... and that wouldn't be pleasant... he would drag me to Rome... those letters... Lucinnius shivers to think of them. \nLUCINNIUS I'm done for, Hector... but it's strange... I feel kind of good about it... the struggle is over ... we've seen it through together, eh? HECTOR I don't know what to say. \nLUCINNIUS Let's get home. We have a lot to do. Lucinnius quickens his pace. LUCINNIUS Tonight... peace at last... Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock. \n36   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               36 Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what he has to do. LUCINNIUS We'll do it with a knife, Hector. When everyone has gone to bed. The two of us, to the end... \nHECTOR I don't understand. What do you want me to do... I don't think I can help you... \nLUCINNIUS We'll help each other, Hector. We must. We've been through this whole mess together... we must die together. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                                   36 HECTOR I don't know what you mean.   What mess?                                                * LUCINNIUS You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor... we're choosing                      * death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we? \nHECTOR You say we... I don't know... what is we? I've done nothing... I                        * know nothing... Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own mind, frank, man-to-man. LUCINNIUS Hector... at Cyprian's this morning ... I had to sign certain papers ... tell a bit of a story... HECTOR What kind of story? LUCINNIUS A confession. That we were plotting against Cyprian and the provincial senate... we were short of names... most of the people I know were in the room... people I thought were my friends... so I mentioned you... I had to... Hector is stunned with shock... \nHECTOR So I'm a conspirator? \nLUCINNIUS Yes. So you see, I don't want you to die with me just because of my honor... it's more complicated... I'm sorry, Hector. I would be honored... if you would die with me... I mean it... Hector manages to speak. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:     (2)                                             36 HECTOR Can I sit down? \n", "test1_id": 828, "test2_input": "FRANCISCO Keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else... leave us alone...! \n(CONTINUED) \n96   CONTINUED:                                                     96 Then from along the beach the sound of RAISED      VOICES distracts them. They see some figures, laden       with supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly in the direction of the trouble. They see two       of the Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers.       The rest make their escape into the jungle. \n97   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                97 \nHector and Francisco reach Dom Paulo's office in the sand. The leading citizens are gathering there as the two captured Deserters are brought in. \nSAILOR They ran off with the dry bread...                     * about eight of them, sir...                            * Dom Paulo looks at the two prisoners. DOM PAULO You men are deserters. You will die tomorrow. He speaks again to the Sailor. DOM PAULO Chain them on the raft for tonight, and watch them... Francisco steps forward, outraged. \nFRANCISCO I must object... these sentences can't be lawful... \nDom Paulo's authoritative manner vanishes in an instant. He becomes hesitant, unsure of himself. As always, his              * Son watches every detail of the exchange.                           * \nDOM PAULO Do you think so? \nFRANCISCO Of course... we can't allow ourselves to fall into terror and violence... \nDOM PAULO You're right... but then how can we punish them? We can't lock them up... \n(CONTINUED) \n97   CONTINUED:                                                    97 Dom Paulo looks around at the assembled notables, confused, out of his depth. Other opinions are voiced. \nSALGADO You were right the first time, sir... they must hang... they were stealing the bread from our mouths... The captured Deserters look on helplessly as their lives are argued over. \nYOUNG DESERTER I didn't steal any bread... Gomes had the bread... he's off, in the forest... \nDOM PAULO Oh dear... Dom Paulo turns to the Priest. DOM PAULO What do you think, Father? The Priest throws open his arms noncommittally. PRIEST I'll comfort them whether they live or die, now or later, any of you, all of you... I'll comfort you all. SALGADO Hang them... you have to set an example... \nDom Paulo is deeply confused. DOM PAULO So I was right the first time? \nFrancisco confuses him even more. FRANCISCO No, sir... there must be proper justice... DOM PAULO What's proper justice?                                * \nDESERTER I didn't steal any bread...

A lot of hands go up. Hector hesitates, his instincts are not for killing. But the force of the majority weighs on him. He starts to raise his hand. At that moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the Deserter whose death they are voting on. For a moment they communicate. Hector is thrown. He drops his hand, only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of Salgado on him. He hesitates again, then starts to raise his hand. Then the eyes of the Deserter find him once more. This comic pantomime goes on while a solid majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands. DOM PAULO ... and those against death... \nOne of the Deserters raises his own hand meekly. DOM PAULO You can't vote... \nThen he looks to Salgado. DOM PAULO Can he? SALGADO It doesn't matter. \nThen the other Deserter raises his hand too. SALGADO I don't think this is working, Dom Paulo... we need authority... you must decide... Dom Paulo thinks. \nDOM PAULO Very well... Da Cunha?

CAMP - EVENING                                           98 It is growing dark. Fires are being lit outside     the shelters. Andre is building Hector's tent while     Hector watches him. The tent is only large enough for     one person, and somehow looks mean compared with the    others. HECTOR Good work, Andre. \nHe looks across to the well-made shelter of Ursula and Francisco. Ursula herself works at the fire. Hector turns to Andre. HECTOR You go and sleep by the big fire, Andre. Keep warm. \nAndre leaves. \n99   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             99 Hector goes inside his little    house. He puts his back to the entrance and opens the    canvas sack which contains all his possessions. He pulls     out his prize, a sizeable chunk of bread and some dried    fruit. He guiltily gnaws at the hard bread. He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside. NUNO Senor Hector? Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the shelter. \nNuno is holding four fruits, about the size of large apples, but green and thick-skinned. NUNO This was all they found in the forest. Four for each of us. They taste kind of milky, but sour. \nHECTOR Thank you, Nuno. NUNO My mother ate three and she was sick. So try two... but she's sick anyway... maybe you can try three... \n(CONTINUED) \n99   CONTINUED:                                                     99 HECTOR I'll start with two. \nNuno makes to leave, but then hesitates. NUNO Hector, will you help me? \nNuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the raft on the shoreline. The shapes of the two Deserters chained there can just be seen. \nNUNO Lopo... the boy they're going to hang tomorrow... he was cook's cabin boy... I was going to take                       * him something to eat... I thought, perhaps, one of yours and one of mine... He looks at the fruit he has just given Hector. NUNO You said you might just eat two... HECTOR But there's tomorrow, Nuno... we must eat tomorrow too... \nNuno looks disappointed. His eyes turn again to his playmate tied to the raft. HECTOR Dom Paulo would call it a waste. You must keep yourself strong, Nuno, that's what he'd say... so that you can help the others... God knows what we have ahead of us... we'll need strong people like you... Nuno is silent, unconvinced. \nHECTOR Try not to think about Lopo any more... The guards wouldn't let you near him anyway. \nNuno stomps away in silence.       Hector shouts after him cheerily. \nHECTOR Goodnight! \n100   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                         100 In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend of formality and madness make the scene comic. \n101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101 \nThe sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party making their way along the beach. The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the camp. Most people are  attending to their morning chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being carried out along the shore. \nOur view of the hangings will be from the distance of the camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form- ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners. It takes a while for the people in the camp to become aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold. The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo and his officers are discussing the appearance of the natives. DA CUNHA Some gunpowder would scatter them, sir. DOM PAULO No, they might want to be friendly... they'll have food too... get one of our African slaves... we must try and talk to them... If they think we're timid we're dead. \n102   EXT. DUNES - DAWN                                           102 A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the natives on the dunes. Everyone in the camp watches as he approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem most interested in the hangings, and point in that direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads. By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the cross making an efficient double-gallows. \n103   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                            103 While Francisco's attention has been on the natives, Hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate himself. He talks while they watch the two events, the hanging and the meeting. HECTOR I hate it when people have to die.                      * FRANCISCO It's foolishness. Killing our own men when we have the whole of Africa to face. HECTOR It's foolish squabbling at all. We should be friends. Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from his jacket and gives it to Francisco. FRANCISCO What's this? \n", "test2_id": 829, "test3_input": "BORIS Yeah... we're covered for most things... the license is current, the inspection certificate is okay... \nHECTOR What's with the we... it's your problem. \nBORIS How is she? HECTOR She's a witch... her   bones must be made of steel... she   didn't break a thing... it might   help if you make a visit to the   hospital... why did you do this   to me? BORIS I'm sorry, Hector... I   just put your name on the lousy   forms... I didn't plan this... I   just borrowed your name on   the titles. Hector doesn't let up on his anger. \nHECTOR I told you to stop doing that... why does this keep happening to me... my name is mine... use your own name, Boris Borlonski... will you remember that? Boris Borlonski! \nBoris is conciliatory. BORIS Hector... forgive me... I'll take care of it... don't let it spoil your weekend... four years, huh? You make the most of it... and don't worry, you'll walk away from this... I'm sorry... \nHector is calm now. We can sense real depth in their relationship, despite Boris's pranks. \n(CONTINUED) \n151   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             151 HECTOR Yeah, I'm sorry too... you have to get out of this business... I thought I had... BORIS Go on... have a great weekend... I'll talk to you on Monday... we'll straighten everything out... HECTOR This is the worst it's been. BORIS Everything can be fixed... always. \nThen Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower motifs and slogans like \"ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS,\" and \"FRESH OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE.\" Anna is a florist. Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car. He runs to meet her. ANNA Get in... you can dropp me at the shop. Hector gets into the car, smiling broadly. \n152   INT. CAR - DAY                                                152 Anna drives skilfully through the busy Friday streets. \nHECTOR You bring my bag? ANNA Yeah. Your camera's in there too. Take some photographs of the kids... \nHECTOR Sure.   Thanks. ANNA Nervous? \n(CONTINUED) \n152   CONTINUED:                                                      152 HECTOR Not much... just like I'm being executed... ANNA Well you deserve to suffer. \nOur Hectors have been hearing this for centuries, but at least Anna smiles when she says it. ANNA Don't worry... this is the beginning of something... not the end... you can start being a father again. \nHECTOR I'm glad you talked me into it. ANNA I didn't do much... you were ready... HECTOR You're right... you're absolutely right... I was ready... I am ready, for everything... I'm fixing all that shit with Boris... I told him... it can't go on... I want my freedom. Anna is looking at him amusedly, nodding her head with every earnest pronouncement that he makes. \nHECTOR ... and the kids... that'll work out... we can have them over sometimes... Yeah? ANNA Sure... that was the plan... when we have the space... HECTOR Right, when we have the space... when we get the bigger apartment... together... ANNA There you go... you said it... the bigger apartment together... \nHector is pleased with himself.

I said it, didn't I? \nANNA You're a man of decision, Hector... \nHector is high on his optimism now, and cheeky with it. HECTOR Yes I am... Together... I said it ... and get out of my car at the corner here... I don't have the time to go 'round the block. \nAnna pulls into the curb. Hector leans over to embrace her before she has stopped the car. HECTOR Thanks... for the car... everything... ANNA Do the best you can with them, Hector... and one more thing... deliver these... She indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in cellophane, taking up the whole of the luggage space in the car. HECTOR What?   Anna, I can't... \nANNA Here's the address... just two blocks before the bridge... a five minute detour. It's a golden wedding... you have to... She looks him straight in the eye. \nANNA We have to help each other... \nHector accepts this. \nANNA Oh, you'll need gas too... Go to it, Hector... \nShe kisses him quickly, but lovingly.

CAR - DAY                                         153 A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence whatever you do with it, and that's fine. Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the threads together. And after so many images of the natural world, a world little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen- sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New Jersey Hector will complete his journey. We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE RINGS ONCE. \nHECTOR Hello... Leonard, hello... yes... we're insured... thank God... yes now I know God's a lawyer... thanks... On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds on green then he might even make it on time. Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out a sigh of relief. \n154   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                        154 \nHector's former wife, JANET, and her new husband, DONALD, come out of the house as Hector walks up to the door. Donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their car in the driveway. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED:                                                      154 DONALD Hi, Hector. \nHe starts loading up the car.       Janet talks to Hector. JANET You made it. The kids are just coming. They're not over the moon about going to the beach house. I ought to warn you. \nHECTOR Why didn't you say? I could have fixed up something else. I thought it would be a good place to get to know them again... \nJANET Well, I figured you should be                            * allowed to make your own mistakes. It's only for a couple of nights, they can take it... and you'll learn... Check into a hotel if it gets too much... they like hotels. She shouts into the house. JANET Come on, you two... your father's ready to go... She hands Hector a piece of paper. \nJANET This is where we'll be, if anything crops up... thanks for the break... Hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on. \nHECTOR Maybe this is a bit sudden for them... Maybe I should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them... \nJanet doesn't let him off the hook. JANET By Monday, you'll know them... \nThen the children come out of the house, BETSY, who is about thirteen, and TOM, who is eleven. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               154 JANET Here he is, the invisible dad. \nShe turns to Hector. JANET That's what they call you. \nHector is daunted by how grown up they are, not any more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet. \nHECTOR Hi. They hardly lift their heads to him. \nBETSY Hi. TOM Hi. Janet takes control of the farewells. \nJANET You three have a good weekend. If it's too miserable at the house your father said he'll take you to a hotel. Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow Hector to his car, eyes to the ground. \nJANET Good luck, Hector. \nDonald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he has been hiding. DONALD See you Monday, Hector. The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car. \nBetsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped in cellophane and red ribbon. It seems to have grown even larger than before. BETSY Are those for mom? \nHector looks at the flowers.       His face contorts in guilt and anxiety. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            154 HECTOR Oh no... Jesus save me... what have I done... BETSY What's wrong? \nHe picks up his mobile phone and is about to dial Anna's number, then he stops. HECTOR No... I can't face it, not just now... He looks at the kids. \n", "test3_id": 830}

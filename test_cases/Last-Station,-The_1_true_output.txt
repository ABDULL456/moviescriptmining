VALENTIN They have a whole life togehter. Why do you have to deny that? 
CHERTKOV You're a victim of her romantic nonsense. You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do. She travels with that unctious little priest. 
VALENTIN Keep the priest away- 
CHERTKOV These people are vultures. They send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church. That's their fantasy. (beat) A death bed recantation. Do you have any idea the damage it would do? Everything he's dreamed of, everything we've worked for will be gone. A simple noble death is what we want. It is what he wants. 
VALENTIN No, you want an icon. You want to take photographs and give out postcards..You want people to kneel in front of an image you´ve created. But he doesn´t wanted that. He never wanted that, and it will give him no peace. (beat) He wants to see her...let her come. 
They see Sasha looking from the door.   She turns and closes it. 
CHERTKOV I will do everything in my power to prevent that. 
VALENTIN Oh, God. You exhaust me. 
CHERTKOV I used to think you were just naive, Valentin, maybe a little stupid.   I see now you're more dangerous than she is. 
He turns back at the door. 
VALENTIN Tell me one thing. That image you want to create, just looks like you, doesn´t it? 
Valentin leaves the room. 
137   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. NIGHT.                             137 
The circus sleeps. Valentin sits on a bench outside the station master's house. The tents erected by the press glow like lanterns in the field. 
Some people lie on the hard platform. He looks across the tracks at Sofya's private car. A single light burns in the window 
138   INT. ASTAPOVO. PRIVATE TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT.               138 
Sofya keeps her solitary vigil. The priest has fallen asleep sitting up. She finishes her prayers, gets up, looks across at the lonely cottage. She can make out Valentin's figure on the platform. 
139   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM.NIGHT                               139 
Dushan appears in the doorway. Solemn, he gestures for him to come inside. Valentin stands. 
140   INT. ASTAPOVO. PRIVATE TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT.               140 
Sofya watches the two figures disappear inside. 
141   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.                141 
Valentin sees Chertkov standing near the bed. Dushan returns to the chair next to Tolstoy. His cheeks are damp, his breathing irregular. 
SASHA It can't be right.    His fever is down. 
DUSHAN His pulse, you see... 
Dushan begins to cry. Suddenly, Tolstoy becomes lucid. 
TOLSTOY Sofya...my dear Sofya. So much has (hic) fallen to her. 
Everyone moves nearer the bed. Tolstoy looks at Valentin. 
TOLSTOY Who's going to look after her? (beat) Someone needs to look after her. 
There is a long pause. Sasha looks at Valentin. 
SASHA Shall I call her? 
TOLSTOY This is it(hic). The end. 
He seems to smile. 
SASHA Do you want to see her, papa? 
TOLSTOY Sasha, Sasha.. It's(hic)nothing...Nothing. 
He falls onto his pillow, asleep. 
CHERTKOV It's almost over. 
Sasha looks at him, shakes her head.

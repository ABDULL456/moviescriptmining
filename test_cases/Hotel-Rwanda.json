{"test1_input": "HOTEL RWANDA \nWritten by \nKeir Pearson & Terry George \nFADE IN: SCREEN TYPE:    THIS IS A TRUE STORY \nEXT. KIGALI AIRPORT. DAY \nA burning white sun high in a clear blue sky, \nPAN DOWN TO: \nA rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat. \nA mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on. \nCLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES. \nA HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm. \nThe van stops next to the policeman. \nPOLICEMAN Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning. \nIn the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie, it is a matter of pride). \nA quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other. \nEXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY \nThe van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio. Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch. \nZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously. \nAn airport baggage handler approaches the van. \nHANDLER Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour. \nPAUL Thank you. (to Zozo) He can get the beer. \nZOZO (suddenly worried) Rutaganda's place? \nPAUL What's wrong? \nZOZO Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there. \nPAUL You are with me, Zozo, don't worry. Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off. \nEXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY \nThe white van, marked \"THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES,\" whips its way through Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets. \nZXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY \nZozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic. \nZOZO What is it like to fly on a plane, sir? \nPAUL It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. \nZOZO That is why they call it coach? \nPAUL Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates. \nZOZO (impressed) You have taken business class? \nPAUL Many times. \nSuddenly, Zozo slows. \nPaul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts. They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia. \n(Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road, obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Turn off. \nZozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind. \nZOZO There is nowhere to turn, sir. As the van approaches, \nPAUL Slow down. \nThe van pulls up beside the Militia. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Boys, do you know the way to Mr. Rutagunda's warehouse? \nSome Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful. \nMILITIA MAN #1 It is one more mile on this road. \nPaul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars. \nPAUL This is thirsty work, let me treat you to some beers. \nAs the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved. \nINT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY \nAt his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso. \nBehind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer. \nGeorge holds out his massive shirt. \n", "test1_true": "Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee. \nPAUL I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics. \nGEORGE Politics is power, Paul. And money. \nPaul studies his watch. \nPAUL Time is money, George. We need extra beer today. \nGEORGE Business is good at the hotel? \nPAUL Very good. \nGEORGE I am always glad to see you Paul. \nGeorge leads Paul out into the warehouse. As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Hell man, that is not beer, put it back! \nDRIVER But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind... GEORGE Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch. (to Paul) I won't charge extra. PAUL Thank you. \nThe driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds of them, spill out. \nAn awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades. \nGEORGE A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar. \nPAUL At least. \nOff Zozo terrified. \nEXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY \nA Sabena airliner lands. Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase. \nPaul's van pulls up by the luggage belt. \nA large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt. It has Brussels - Kigali destination stickers all over it. \nAs Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid. \nPAUL The ice has melted! \nZozo goes to open it. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Don't. Let's go. \nPaul slips money to two customs officials. \nEXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY \nThe van speeds through traffic. More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the sidewalk. Then at an intersection they see. \nTHE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears, wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, \"Hutu Power.\" \nA flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd. \nZozo sinks down behind the wheel. \nPAUL Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself. \nZOZO Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi. \nThe parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George gave him, peels off a few dollars. P \nPAUL Here, Zozo, for your trouble. \nZozo takes it. \nEXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE. DAY \nThe van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway and HONKS twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs. An ARMED GUARD rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. Perfectly timed. The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. A sign on the guard house reads \"WELCOME TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES\". \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY \nLush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an exotic African paradise. The van heads to a magnificent colonial building. \nPAUL (V.O.) Pull up at the front door. \nA valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. It's unheard of for a service van to stop out front. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (urgent, to the valet) Help Zozo. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nPaul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful blend of Africa and Europe. Guests stare as water sloshes and spills from the crate. \nGREGOIRE, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look of disapproval. Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him. \nPAUL (re: spilled water) Gregoire. Take care of this. \nGregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Gregoire!   See to this right away. \nThe elevator door opens and reveals BIK the Belgian hotel manager, mid- 40's, reading some reports. He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying the box as they step in. Bik looks puzzled. \nPAUL (CONT'D) It's an emergency, sir. Now Bik sees the wet floor. \nBIK Paul! \nPAUL Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me. \n", "test1_id": 171, "test2_input": "GENERAL BIZIMUNGU I will see what I can do. \nPAUL I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness? \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU I am strong, Paul, like a lion. \nPAUL I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one. \nPaul nods over toward Gregoire. \nENERAL BIZIMUNGU He is staff? \nhe General gets up. \nGregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D) Get to work, you slug. \nGregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend. \nThe General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D) Make sure, Paul, your guests are generous. \nINT. LOBBY. DAY \nBenedict greets Paul in the lobby. \nBENEDICT Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office. \nPAUL We, who is we? \nBENEDICT A delegation. \nINT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nPaul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled, there's an air of tension in the room. \nPAUL Yes. \nA brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks. \nBANKER You have no right to charge us rent. \nPAUL Why not? \nBANKER This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery. \nODETTE That is not true. \nAnother accuser speaks up. \nTUTSI ACCUSER Yes it is. He charges for food, for everything. Where is all this money going? We hear he has a deal with Bizimungu. \nTUTSI ACCUSER #2 It is said that you work for the murderer George Rutagunda. \nMurmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough. \nPAUL I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a deal with General Bizimungu. He was just here. I worked out another money making scheme for him. New arrivals will be taxed at the gate. \nSilence. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Do you know what my deal is with Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you alive. Anyone want to take their money back? \nPAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Here, here take it. And you don't have to pay your bill. I will move you into the ballroom or out into the gardens. \nHe walks among them. \nPAUL (CONT'D) And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda. I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I will have to visit his warehouse soon because we are running out of food. Who wants to come with me? \nPaul holds the door open. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Anyone who wants to come with me stay behind. If not, please leave. \nThey hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste remain. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (laughs) You are most certainly not coming with me. You will get me killed. \nJEAN BAPTISTE You can't go to that place, they know what you are doing here. \nPAUL George will not hurt me, I am too profitable to him. \nODETTE What if he is not there? \nPaul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out. \nINT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT \nRoger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on the floor. \nTO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates the Gregoire story in whispers. \nPAUL As soon as the General left he came running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me, sir, I have been possessed by a witch. (Paul's own voice now) A witch you say? (mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was in that room. The president's room, why would I be in the president's room? (own voice) Indeed, the General asked me the same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own voice) Does Gregoire think he is president now? \nPAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear. \nTATIANA (laughing) Stop, stop, we will waken the children. \nPaul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more. \nPAUL Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef. \nTATIANA So where is the lamb? \n", "test2_true": "They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over him. \nTATIANA What's the matter? \nPAUL We're running out of beer and other supplies. \nShe kisses him. \nTATIANA The foreigners abandon us and you do inventory. You are so conscientious. \nShe kisses him again, tries to cheer him. \nPAUL I have to go out to get food. \nTATIANA Go out! Where? \nPAUL To Rutagunda's place. It is close by. \nTATIANA No, no. \nPAUL I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide. TATIANA You cannot go alone. \nPAUL I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nThe lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed. \nG           PAUL regoire it is good to see you back to work. \nGREGOIRE Please, except my humblest apologies... \nPAUL Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George? \nGregoire nods, impressed. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Fetch the van. \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN \nA thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge. \nGREGOIRE (fearful) Where are we going, sir? \nPAUL For supplies, you drive. \nGREGOIRE The fog is too heavy, sir. \nPAUL Just drive, Gregoire. \nINT. VAN. DAWN \nThey pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box. \nThe van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over broken glass, the fog swirls around them. \nThen Gregoire hits the brakes. \nIn front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across two oil drums. \nThey wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one. \nGREGOIRE We should go back, sir. \nPaul wants to agree, but can't. He opens his door. \nEXT. ROAD. DAY \nPaul gets out, tentative. \nPAUL Hello? \nNothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the ground, hurries back to the van. \nINT. VAN. DAWN \nPAUL Let's go. \nThey drive past the barricade. \nThe van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets. \nhey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress, shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner. \nEXT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAWN \nThe fog still hangs like a cloud. As they pull up, a group of young Militia emerge from Toyota trucks. \nMILITIAMAN #1 What do you want? \nPAUL We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda. \nMILITIAMAN #1 The commander is not here. \nPAUL He will be here. \nMILITIAMAN #1 Show me your ID \nPaul and Gregoire hand over their ID cards. The Militia man studies them, then pockets the cards. \nPAUL Excuse me. \nMILITIAMAN #1 What? \n", "test2_id": 172, "test3_input": "The UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out, strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand. \nCOLONEL OLIVER Great news, Paul, we're going to get you out of here. \nI The sweetest words Paul has ever heard. \nINT.

We can wait there to obtain visas. \nCOLONEL OLIVER I can't do that. Our camp at the airport is overwhelmed already. We could not defend you there. You are better to stay here and work to get an exit visa. \nOliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd. Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the list. \nPAUL Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be on the list. \nOliver shakes his head no. COLONEL OLIVER Paul, only those I called can get on the trucks. I do not want to have to pull people off, you understand? \nPaul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside. \nTATIANA I will not leave without the twins. \nPAUL We have to get out of here Tatiana. \nTATIANA Please, please try one more time. \nPAUL I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. \nShe reluctantly nods yes. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nMr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby. \nPaul arrives. \nMR. GARINDI It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches. \nPAUL I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins. \nMR. GARINDI (emphatic) No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead. \nPAUL How do you know? \nMR. GARINDI Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go. \nPAUL I will give you my house. \nThe businessman turns back. \nPAUL (CONT'D) It's a fine house. Here is a paper. \nPaul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He runs to her.            P \nPAUL (CONT'D) Madame Kawunda, please. \nPaul leads her over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I need you to witness this signature. (to the businessman) Madame Kawunda is the Minister for Agriculture.

HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT \nPaul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn. The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds are a mini refugee camp. \nPaul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the pool. \nDETTE Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next list. \n", "test3_true": "ZOZO No ma,am, I am too busy. \nPAUL Zozo you are family, join us.

{"train": "HOTEL RWANDA \nWritten by \nKeir Pearson & Terry George \nFADE IN: SCREEN TYPE:    THIS IS A TRUE STORY \nEXT. KIGALI AIRPORT. DAY \nA burning white sun high in a clear blue sky, \nPAN DOWN TO: \nA rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat. \nA mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on. \nCLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES. \nA HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm. \nThe van stops next to the policeman. \nPOLICEMAN Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning. \nIn the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie, it is a matter of pride). \nA quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other. \nEXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY \nThe van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio. Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch. \nZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously. \nAn airport baggage handler approaches the van. \nHANDLER Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour. \nPAUL Thank you. (to Zozo) He can get the beer. \nZOZO (suddenly worried) Rutaganda's place? \nPAUL What's wrong? \nZOZO Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there. \nPAUL You are with me, Zozo, don't worry. Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off. \nEXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY \nThe white van, marked \"THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES,\" whips its way through Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets. \nZXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY \nZozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic. \nZOZO What is it like to fly on a plane, sir? \nPAUL It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. \nZOZO That is why they call it coach? \nPAUL Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates. \nZOZO (impressed) You have taken business class? \nPAUL Many times. \nSuddenly, Zozo slows. \nPaul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts. They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia. \n(Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road, obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Turn off. \nZozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind. \nZOZO There is nowhere to turn, sir. As the van approaches, \nPAUL Slow down. \nThe van pulls up beside the Militia. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Boys, do you know the way to Mr. Rutagunda's warehouse? \nSome Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful. \nMILITIA MAN #1 It is one more mile on this road. \nPaul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars. \nPAUL This is thirsty work, let me treat you to some beers. \nAs the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved. \nINT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY \nAt his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso. \nBehind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer. \nGeorge holds out his massive shirt. \nThe elevator doors shut. Bik's left standing in disbelief. \nINT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY \nThe crate is hefted onto a counter. The top pried off. A crowd of cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in. \nZOZO Any of them make it? \nHEAD CHEF Into the sink! \nThey hoist up one end of the crate and LOBSTERS spill out. Many make it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall onto the floor. \nThe cooks sort the living from the dead. \nZOZO Twelve are dead. \nPAUL How dead? \nThe cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill them will ah, a stuffing, something local. \nCOOK Cassava, and Tipali. \nPAUL Yes. Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a cassava and Tipali crush'. \nPaul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved. \nINT. BANQUET ROOM/HOTEL MILLE COLLINES. DAY \nPaul inspects the tables' fresh flowers, sparkling crystal glasses. He looks to the bar - Grolsch on ice. \nThe sound of African drums fills the air. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nPaul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume - Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of European dignitaries. \nThe male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in similar ceremonial dress. The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale. The guests break into LOUD APPLAUSE. Paul flings open double doors to a reception room and the crowd moves in. \nPAUL Mr. Ambassador, please come in. \nUS AMBASSADOR Thank you, Paul. \nA UN Colonel, OLIVER, middle aged, Canadian,follows the US Ambassador. The Colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of UN Peacekeepers. (all UN troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets, white helmets and arm bands) \nPAUL Colonel Oliver, you are very welcome. The Ambassador shakes the Colonel's hand. \nUS AMBASSADOR Colonel. I'd like you to meet Mr. Colson, of our Regional Aid Division. \nMR. COLSON, crew cut, military build, is obviously CIA. \nUS AMBASSADOR (CONT'D) Colonel Oliver is the liason officer for the U.N. peace keeping forces. \nPaul backs away unnoticed... \nINT.

He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local independent newspaper. \nBENEDICT Paul, Paul, a moment please. \nPAUL Yes, Benedict, what can I do? \nBENEDICT Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception? \nPAUL I'm sorry, it's a private function. \nBenedict takes out his reporters notebook. \nBENEDICT At least tell me who is attending. The newspaper will be grateful. \nPaul laughs. \nPAUL I will be grateful if you keep my name out of your newspaper. Wait here and you will see who has attended as they leave. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nPaul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock room hatch. \nPAUL (to the coat check) Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase? \nCOAT CHECK Yes, sir. \nPAUL Excuse me? \nBIK The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish? \nPAUL Leave it to me. \nBik leans slightly closer. \nBIK Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times? \nPAUL Of course. \nEXT.

This is ODETTE, their family doctor and close friend. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time? \nTATIANA I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais.

She laughs. \nCARINE I am Carine. \nPAUL You are not Anais? \nANAIS I am Anais. \nPAUL Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a present for Anais. \nAnais reaches out her hand.

George points his glass toward the Europeans. \nGEORGE Look at them, they want to see the tribes dance to their tune. Here is our dance. \nRutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the Hutu Militia War Dance. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Come on, Paul. Show them our dance. \nPaul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then   appears to stumble and shoulder bumps the big man. \nGeorge falls into his chair. \nPAUL Forgive me, George, my step was off. \nRutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts: \nGEORGE To our president.

Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon? \nGLORIA We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection. \nShe walks off. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nA convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco wig, waves a cordless power drill.

Behind her two monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads. \nGLORIA Okay London .... and five four three two one ...That's correct Tom. Today's gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force in a state of disarray. Its commander has called for re-enforcements. However, the General Council is deeply divided. The United States, still smarting from the UN's disastrous Somalia mission, has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce. Meanwhile, the slaughter goes on. Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda. \nGloria on the phone, listens. \nGLORIA And, cut ...good, give me a call guys, let me know you've got it. \nJock turns to Paul. \nJOCK Perfect timing. \nPAUL This goes out live? \nJock points skyward. \nJOCK Satellite feed. \nGLORIA (ON PHONE) Great.

Holy shit. \nGLORIA What is it? \nJock focuses \nOn the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill. \nNOW FOCUS: Of a crowd hovering close to a group of Rwandan Tutsis seated on the ground. Two Militia emerge from the crowd, waving machetes. They SLASH their way along the line, savage, powerful blows, butchering people like cattle.          (Author note: we will use real news footage of this) \nJOCK (CONT'D) You fucking see that! \nGLORIA (shock) Oh my God! \nOn Screen: The crowd run off, waving machetes. \nCOLONEL OLIVER (raw cynicism) Congratulations. You should spit in my face. \nPAUL Excuse me, Colonel. COLONEL OLIVER We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. \nPAUL I don't understand. \nCOLONEL OLIVER Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing. \nPaul doesn't answer. \nCOLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D) You're fucking black!

Black soldiers, Pakistanis. \nHe looks up at her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) The most the Colonel can spare for the hotel are four men, and they're not allowed to shoot. \nHe takes her hand, makes her sit down. \nPAUL (CONT'D) If anything should happen, if the Militia arrive, you must take the children and go to the roof. \nTatiana's eyes are wide with fear. \nTATIANA What for? \nPaul takes his anger out on Tatiana. \nPAUL Do what I say, woman.

TATIANA Where's Roger? \nDanielle points to under the bed. \nCLOSE ON: Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears. \nPAUL Come on son, everything is all right. He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to Tatiana as he phones the front desk. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (on phone) Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer. \nHe turns to Tatiana. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Go to the roof now. \nTATIANA (terrified) What for Paul. \nPAUL (forceful) Do as I say. I will be there soon. \nHe hurries out. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY \nPaul's door opens, his head appears round the corner. \nThe corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs up. \nPAUL (to the man with the pistol) Are you mad? They will gun us all down. \nPISTOL MAN Better to die by the bullet than the machete. \nPaul pulls the gun off him. \nPAUL Wait here, please. \nPaul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off. \nINT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nPaul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials. \nPAUL (ON PHONE) Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do you know where he is? Please ask him to call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent. \nPhone again. \nA SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him? \nANOTHER CALL: \nPAUL (CONT'D) Who would order such a thing? \nANOTHER CALL: \nPAUL (CONT'D) Did you find the General? \nPaul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it. \nINT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. DAY \nThe Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches. \nPRESIDENT If British Airways abandons the route we should bid for it. \nHis intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then. \nSECRETARY (ON PHONE) I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent. \nThe president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button. \nPRESIDENT Paul. Are you alright? \nPAUL (O.S.) We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. \nThe president is baffled. \nRESIDENT Out? Where are you going? \nPAUL I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all. \nPaul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have left.) \nTatiana is frozen to the spot. \nPAUL They have gone. \nTatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him, thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as he shakes hands and hugs them. \nZOZO Sir. The president of Sabena is on the phone for you. \nINT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nPaul arrives behind the front desk. \nPaul hits the button. \nPAUL They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did you do? \nINT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. BRUSSELS. DAY \nGotfroid is at his desk. \nSABENA PRESIDENT I managed to get the President of France on the phone. \nPAUL (O.S.) Thank you, sir, you saved our lives. \nSABENA PRESIDENT Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen. \nPAUL Why? \nSABENA PRESIDENT I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans. \nSilence. \nSABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D) You have to get out of there, Paul. I will do whatever I can. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nThe elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad, are gathered in the office. \nPAUL There will be no rescue, no intervention force. We can only save ourselves. Call any foreigner you know, tell them what will happen to us. Say goodbye but when you say goodbye, say it as though you're reaching through and shaking their hand. Let them know if they let go of that hand, you will die. (silence) We must shame them into sending help. \nThe others look stunned. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Get on the phones while we still can. At least we can say they heard our cries. Zozo come with me. \nPaul leaves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nPaul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a five star hotel. \nHe turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and erases the register. \nHe picks up the phone, calls. \nPAUL Send two of the housekeeping carpenters to the lobby. \nPaul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Everyone gather together now. Zozo get them all together. \nThey herd together quickly. \nPAUL (CONT'D) No one can remain in this lobby any longer. I have rooms available. Who can pay? The rental is six hundred francs per day. \nAbout fifty percent of the hands go up. \nTUTSI WOMAN I cannot pay? \nPAUL Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one will be allowed to stay in the lobby. \nThe carpenters arrive beside Paul. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Good. I want you to go around and take all the numbers off the doors. \nCARPENTER What shall we put in their place. \nPAUL Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY \nPaul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi refugees. A door opens. \nPAUL Good day. Here is your bill for the last week.

The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees that it is Paul. \nXAVIER Come in Paul. \nINT. HOTEL LUXURY SUITE. DAY \nA beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the other refugees. \nPAUL I'm afraid you will have to move room. \nXAVIER Move? Where to? \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU I will see what I can do. \nPAUL I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness? \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU I am strong, Paul, like a lion. \nPAUL I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one. \nPaul nods over toward Gregoire. \nENERAL BIZIMUNGU He is staff? \nhe General gets up. \nGregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D) Get to work, you slug. \nGregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend. \nThe General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D) Make sure, Paul, your guests are generous. \nINT. LOBBY. DAY \nBenedict greets Paul in the lobby. \nBENEDICT Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office. \nPAUL We, who is we? \nBENEDICT A delegation. \nINT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nPaul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled, there's an air of tension in the room. \nPAUL Yes. \nA brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks. \nBANKER You have no right to charge us rent. \nPAUL Why not? \nBANKER This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery. \nODETTE That is not true. \nAnother accuser speaks up. \nTUTSI ACCUSER Yes it is. He charges for food, for everything. Where is all this money going? We hear he has a deal with Bizimungu. \nTUTSI ACCUSER #2 It is said that you work for the murderer George Rutagunda. \nMurmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough. \nPAUL I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a deal with General Bizimungu. He was just here. I worked out another money making scheme for him. New arrivals will be taxed at the gate. \nSilence. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Do you know what my deal is with Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you alive. Anyone want to take their money back? \nPAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Here, here take it. And you don't have to pay your bill. I will move you into the ballroom or out into the gardens. \nHe walks among them. \nPAUL (CONT'D) And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda. I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I will have to visit his warehouse soon because we are running out of food. Who wants to come with me? \nPaul holds the door open. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Anyone who wants to come with me stay behind. If not, please leave. \nThey hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste remain. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (laughs) You are most certainly not coming with me. You will get me killed. \nJEAN BAPTISTE You can't go to that place, they know what you are doing here. \nPAUL George will not hurt me, I am too profitable to him. \nODETTE What if he is not there? \nPaul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out. \nINT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT \nRoger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on the floor. \nTO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates the Gregoire story in whispers. \nPAUL As soon as the General left he came running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me, sir, I have been possessed by a witch. (Paul's own voice now) A witch you say? (mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was in that room. The president's room, why would I be in the president's room? (own voice) Indeed, the General asked me the same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own voice) Does Gregoire think he is president now? \nPAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear. \nTATIANA (laughing) Stop, stop, we will waken the children. \nPaul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more. \nPAUL Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef. \nTATIANA So where is the lamb? \nPAUL Our cards, please. \nMILITIAMAN #1 What cards? \nPAUL You have our cards. \nMILITIAMAN #1 No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards? \nPAUL How much? \nMILITIAMAN #1 One thousand francs. \nThen from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out. \nhe Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back. \nMILITIAMAN #1 (CONT'D) apologetic) joke. \nRutagunda strides over. \nGEORGE Paul. My old friend. \nPaul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors of the warehouse. They walk in. \nINT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY \nThe warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George points to the stacks of beer. \nGEORGE Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? \nPAUL I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.    G \nEORGE Beer yes, but no whiskey. \nPAUL You have no whiskey? \nGEORGE No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul. \nPaul counts out the Rwandan francs. \nPAUL What do you mean George? GEORGE Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead. PAUL (incredulous) ) You cannot kill them all. \nGEORGE \nWhy not? We are half way there already. \nPaul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window. EORGE (CONT'D) Let me give you a tip my friend, our generals in the army say 'do not go near the Mille Collines or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here'. But the generals are about to leave, and we will be in charge. It is time to butcher your cow for the meat. (a beat) You can help us Paul. You have some very important traitors at your hotel. The politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If we were to get them, then maybe we could let one or two cockroaches get away. You understand, Paul. \nPaul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully. \nPAUL Let's go. \nGEORGE Take the river road back. It is clear. \nThe van takes off. \nINT. VAN. DAWN \nThe fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead. \nPAUL Are you sure this is the river road? \nGREGOIRE I saw the sign. \nThe van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump. \nPAUL Stop. You've driven off the road. You'll put us in the river. \nThe van jerks to a halt. \nEXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN \nPaul clambers out, stumbles, falls. \nAnd discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own death - an African Munz's Scream. \nPaul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies, men, women, children. \nhe bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them. \nA breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet. \nREVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog. \nFinally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van. \nPAUL Go back! Go back! \nGregoire throws the van into reverse. \nhey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another horror. \nEXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY \nThe van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns to Gregoire. \nPAUL Tell no one what you saw, do you understand? \nGregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van. \nEXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY \nPaul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool, laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in Central Park. P \nPAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a flood, he buries his face in his hands. \nThe UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out, strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand. \nCOLONEL OLIVER Great news, Paul, we're going to get you out of here. \nI The sweetest words Paul has ever heard. \nINT.

A plane will land at the airport tomorrow and the named families will be flown to Kenya. Two UN trucks will be here at 7 a.m. The named families must be ready to leave then. \nvoice calls out. \nTUTSI WOMAN Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the airport? We can wait there to obtain visas. \nCOLONEL OLIVER I can't do that. Our camp at the airport is overwhelmed already. We could not defend you there. You are better to stay here and work to get an exit visa. \nOliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd. Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the list. \nPAUL Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be on the list. \nOliver shakes his head no. COLONEL OLIVER Paul, only those I called can get on the trucks. I do not want to have to pull people off, you understand? \nPaul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside. \nTATIANA I will not leave without the twins. \nPAUL We have to get out of here Tatiana. \nTATIANA Please, please try one more time. \nPAUL I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. \nShe reluctantly nods yes. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nMr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby. \nPaul arrives. \nMR. GARINDI It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches. \nPAUL I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins. \nMR. GARINDI (emphatic) No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead. \nPAUL How do you know? \nMR. GARINDI Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go. \nPAUL I will give you my house. \nThe businessman turns back. \nPAUL (CONT'D) It's a fine house. Here is a paper. \nPaul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He runs to her.            P \nPAUL (CONT'D) Madame Kawunda, please. \nPaul leads her over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I need you to witness this signature. (to the businessman) Madame Kawunda is the Minister for Agriculture. She is a very reliable witness. \nPaul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Please witness this deed. \nShe signs. Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand. \nPAUL (CONT'D) There, now go and find them. They have no papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They will be alive. \nThe businessman heads for the door. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow. \nPaul watches him go. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Seven, remember. \nThe Mr. Garindi leaves. \nEXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT \nPaul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn. The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds are a mini refugee camp. \nPaul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the pool. \nDETTE Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next list. \nPaul whispers to Benedict as he boards. \nINT.

You promised us beer. \nPAUL Did you explain to the good General that I have temporarily run out of stock? \nGENDARME He said to ask Mitterand and the French to send you more. \nPAUL You will get it in due time.

I have the answer. Watch. \nThey all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like an ape. \nBENEDICT (CONT'D) We must become mountain gorillas. Then they can put us on the endangered species list. Come on, try it. They think we're halfway there already. \nBenedict hops up onto a desk. \nThe door flies open.

Paul, delirious with fear, runs along the parapet. \nBELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia. \nHe runs back to the stairs. \nINSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time. \nINSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia. \nTO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the bed. \nINTO THE BATHROOM - empty. \nHe's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining hotel room is slightly open. \nINTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER. \nFROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious. \nIN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain. \nReveals: A cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands over the mouths of the younger ones. And there at the back: Tatiana and his kids. \nPAUL (CONT'D) It's alright, they're gone. \nTears, hugs, women tremble. \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN \nThe grey of dawn, before the sunrise. \nColonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of UN trucks past the guard house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive. \nCUT TO: \nTHE UN TRUCKS \nParked in front of the hotel. Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on board by UN soldiers. \nPaul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck. \n", "test1_input": "He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog. \nTATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want Victor? \nThey watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to die. It's a horror. \nTATIANA (CONT'D) Do something. \nPAUL What? \nTATIANA Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake. \nPAUL Please, be quiet. \nTatiana, moves toward the gate handle. \nTATIANA I'm going to talk to them. \nPaul grabs her. \nPAUL No. \nTATIANA We must do something. \nPaul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house. \nPAUL What would you have us do? Argue with these madmen? We cannot interfere. \nINT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nThomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears. \nPAUL You better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets. \nTatiana hides her anger. \nTATIANA I'll fix a bed. \nINT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nPaul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am. \nTATIANA Why didn't you call your contacts in the army? \nPAUL I couldn't help. \nTATIANA You could have asked for a favor. \nPAUL No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? All day long I work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon. Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger. \nTATIANA Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. \nPAUL He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us? \nTATIANA They do not have your connections. \nPAUL Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think \"Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody.\" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment. \nHis turn away indicates the discussion is over. \nEXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING \nPaul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house. \nSUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994. \nAn army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie. \nThe General gives an I'll see you soon wave. \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY \nThe hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps, foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors. Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload. \nPAUL Welcome, gentlemen. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nThe lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset. \nGLORIA We reserved five rooms not two \nGREGOIRE I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here in the computer. \nJock sees Paul. \nJOCK Paul, how the hell are ya'? \nPAUL I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish. \nJOCK They moved you from the Diplomat? \nPAUL Promoted. House Manager. \nJOCK Good for you. \n(moves closer) We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but... \nPaul moves behind the desk. \nPAUL Let me check. \nHe punches into the computer. \nPAUL Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of BBC Gregoire. \n", "test1_true": "Of course, the BBC, five rooms. (lies) They are being prepared as we speak. I have ordered fresh flowers and complimentary champagne. \nGloria picks up her bag. \nGLORIA Great, I really need a shower. \nPAUL Just give me a moment to get your keys. \nPaul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter Benedict hovering at the door. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (to Gloria) Excuse me for one second. \nPaul hurries over to Benedict. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Benedict, you should meet the BBC people. They could use your expertise. \nBenedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (whisper) Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here any moment. The BBC should talk to him. \nThey join the BBC team. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of our best journalists. He covers all the big stories. I thought you should meet. \nGloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm. \nGLORIA Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria Fleming. BBC. \nPaul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure. \nGREGOIRE There are no more rooms. \nPAUL Give me the phone. \nGregoire hands it over. Paul dials. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Madame Denver. I have very good news. I have a present for you, in return for the cancellation of your gorilla expedition I have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no extra charge. A luxury coach will leave in one hour. I'll send maids up to help you all pack. You're welcome. \nPaul hangs up, turns to Gregoire. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him I need three rooms. And send a team of maids up to the Americans. I want those rooms turned around in twenty minutes. \nPAUL heads for the glass doors and sees: \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY \nGeneral Bizimungu, briefcase in hand, gives the tv interview, He's confident, controlled Benedict stands close by as Gloria interviews. \nGLORIA There are rumors, General, that your army, the Hutu army, consider these peace accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU (laughs) Nonsense. At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces. \nGLORIA Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing. Thank you for coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will see what a beautiful country this is. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY \nPaul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his hand out. Gregoire hands him keys. \nPaul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal. \nHe looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity. \nHe wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'. \nHe returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage. \nPAUL Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake. It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa. \nOB Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there was famine in Africa. \nPAUL Exactly, we can't have our guests starving. What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States? \nGen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty briefcase. \nGENERAL BIZIMUNGU Keep that cockroach Benedict away from me. \nAs the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check, hands her the briefcase. \nPAUL Same as last time. \nShe nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out keys, greets each. \nPAUL (CONT'D) The fifth room is your broadcast room. \nGLORIA Good. I'd like to book a massage. \nPAUL Of course. \nJock, the Scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes his key. \nJOCK Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know? \nPAUL I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here. \nJOCK Can we phone them in, Paul? \nPAUL I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. Ah, Zozo. \nPaul calls Zozo over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat? \n", "test1_id": 171, "test2_input": "The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry. \nTATIANA Please, Paul, 'til first light. \nPAUL Dawn. Then they go. \nPaul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest daughter. \nODETTE Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that Roger has gone. \nTatiana comes over instantly, worried. \nTATIANA Gone where? Tell me, Danielle. Their daughter Danielle answers. \nDANIELLE Next door, mama. He was afraid for his friend Simon. He went to fetch him. \nEXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT \nRoger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES. \nHe peers through the long grass. \nSees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a length of chain CLANGING on the ground. \nEXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT \nTatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her. \nPaul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth. \nPAUL Shhhhh. \nSHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing. E \nEXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT \nRoger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate. Engines rev. \nRoger crawls from the bushes. \nCrawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle. \nThen stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR! \nEXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT \nPaul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate. \nPaul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he pulls it back, clambers underneath it. Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry. \nEXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel. \nThen he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING. He moves toward the sound. Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes. He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles. PAUL Ssshh! Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house. \nINT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT \nPaul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is beside them. \nTATIANA Roger! \nPaul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear. \nTATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God! PAUL Where are you hurt, son? \noger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now. \nODETTE Get his clothes off. \nHands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger has no injuries. \nPAUL What happened, son? Where did you get this blood? \nBut Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry. \nODETTE He's not injured. \nHis paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them. \nPAUL Leave us, give us some space. \nHe ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (to Tatiana) The neighbors must go at dawn. \nTatiana hugs her son. \nEXT. KIGALI. DAWN \nThe faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a grenade explosion, echoes. \nThe birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun rips the air. \nINT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN \nPAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. \nBehind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk. \nTATIANA Will you take a little milk? \nNothing. \nPAUL Let him sleep. \nThe door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened. \n", "test2_true": "He heads for the door. \nINT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN \nPaul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the men wait nervously. \nJEAN BAPTISTE It is true. \nHe holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.) \nGLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.) The Hutu president's plane was struck by a ground-to-air missile as he returned from signing the peace accord with the Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors. The Hutu government has already blamed the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied the accusation. Already there are reports of reprisal killings on the streets. \nAs they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window where she's been sitting. \nWOMEN (O.S.) They are here. \nHysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees: \nA HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another up beside him. \nanic in the room now. Paul turns. \nPAUL Shut up! \nPAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols. \nTATIANA (O.S.) What is it, Paul. \nPAUL Stay with the children. \nPAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open. \nTwo jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his garden. The soldiers jump out. \nINSIDE THE ROOM: \nNothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms. Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door. \nThe door gives, SOLDIERS flood in. \nThey are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised, SHOUTS. \nSOLDIERS Out, get out now! \nPaul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier. \nPAUL Who is in charge? \nA Captain is at the door. \nCAPTAIN Who are you? \nPAUL I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu. \nCAPTAIN We are looking for you. \nHe takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside. \nEXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN \nThe Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard. \nTatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded together. \nPAUL What is this about? \nCAPTAIN Let me see your identity card. \nPaul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain. \nCLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU. \nThe Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president. \nPAUL Yes, it is a calamity for us all. \nCAPTAIN You work at the Hotel Diplomat? \nPAUL No. I work at the Mille Collines. \nThe Captain looks confused. Paul quickly: \nPAUL (CONT'D) I used to work at the Diplomat. \nCAPTAIN Do you know how to open the safe there? (Paul nods) Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it. \nPAUL Of course. \nPaul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see what is going on. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here. \nCAPTAIN Where is your family? \nTatiana is beside him now. \nTATIANA (interrupts) This is them. \nTatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned. \nCAPTAIN All of them! I cannot take them. \n", "test2_id": 172, "test3_input": "TATIANA No, no, good Captain, you do not have to. We have the car and our van. \nShe points to the Mille Collines van. \nhe Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent message. He listens. \nTatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second, they are all clambering in. \nCAPTAIN Let's go. \nPaul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed together on the front bench. \nThe convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the street. \nThe Militia men wave sticks, machetes. \nINT. VAN TRAVELING - DAY \nPaul looks back as they speed off down the street. \nSees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway. \nAs they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push a stove on a child's skateboard. \nTATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head. \nEXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY \nThe convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes, nailed clubs and spears as they dance. \nFURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in terror, waiting for the windows to give way. \nIn the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies. \nPAUL (to Tatiana) Don't look. \nEXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY \nThe convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul, bursts into waves of joy. \nROBERT Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open every door right now for the government. \nPaul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep. \nPAUL (to the Captain) The safe is in the manager's office. \nThe Captain nods to two soldiers. \nCAPTAIN Go with him, get the keys. \nINT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY \nPaul runs through the lobby. The staff look petrified. \nINT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY \nPaul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow. \nHe goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten the number. \nThe soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises. \nPAUL Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate, and maybe a few beers in the fridge. Don't let them go to waste. \nThe soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge. \nPaul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens. \nHe sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal. \nHe looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over the beer and chocolates in the fridge. \ns they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I've got them. \nHe is about to leave. \nSOLDIER 1 Wait! \nPaul looks back at the soldier. \nSOLDIER 1 (CONT'D) Sit down. \nPaul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into their pockets. \nINT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY \nPaul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance. \nEXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT ENTRANCE. DAY \nPaul emerges to see: \nAll of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their knees, with their hands on their heads. \nThe Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul. He marches toward him and SLAPS HIM HARD on the face. \nCAPTAIN Traitor! \nPaul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet. \nThe Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the cards in Paul's face. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) They are all Tutsi cockroaches. \n", "test3_true": "He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers, shoves it into Paul's hand. \nCAPTAIN SHOOT THEM! \nPaul looks at him. \nPAUL Please, I don't use guns. \nCAPTAIN There is nothing to it. \nThe Captain raises his own pistol and FIRES it. Everyone jumps with fright. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Shoot them now or you die first. \nThe Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head. Cocks the hammer. \nPAUL Captain, what could I pay you not to do this? \nThe Captain laughs. \nCAPTAIN You want to pay me? \nPAUL Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work? \nCAPTAIN How much? \nPAUL Name a price. \nCAPTAIN Ten thousand francs for each one. \nPAUL I don't have that much. \nThe Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Wait! Wait! \nPaul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines. \nCAPTAIN How many in your family? \nPAUL Six. \nThe Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes. \nAPTAIN Pull your family out. \nPaul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls. Odette kneels beside Tatiana. Paul whispers. \nPAUL Have you any money? \nODETTE Nothing. \nPaul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain pocket the dollars, move toward the line. \nTATIANA Paul, don't let them die. \nPAUL (urgent) Get in. \nPaul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for all the courage he can muster, then turns back. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Captain, let these people give you some money, whatever they have. \nThe Captain hesitates. Paul sees this, runs over to the line of neighbors. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Give me everything, everything you have. \nA pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry falls onto the ground. Paul scoops it all up. T \nhe Captain looks at it, takes it, then: \nCAPTAIN There is only enough for one cockroach. \nThe Captain raises his pistol. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Pick one to take with you. \nNow each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging. \nPAUL Wait, wait. \nPaul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Ten. \nCAPTAIN And four children? \nPAUL I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them. \nThe Captain points the gun. \nCAPTAIN Give me it. \nPAUL I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you. \nCAPTAIN You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N. \nPAUL I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house.

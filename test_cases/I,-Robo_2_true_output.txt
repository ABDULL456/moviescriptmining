ARONSON You don't have to answer that, Dr. Robertson... 
Robertson waves him off. 
ROBERTSON Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us here? 
Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT. Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone but Spooner. 
CALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships. Rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines. He spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home. As a result he was highly susceptible to depression. 
ROBERTSON Dr. Calvin is our Chief Psychologist. 
SPOONER If that was your diagnosis, why didn't you see this coming? 
Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the answer's obvious. 
CALVIN This is U.S. Robotics, Detective. Seventy-five percent of our employees fit that description. 
LANNING (interceding) You'll have to excuse the doctor. We're all a little on edge. This has been a difficult and emotional morning. 
Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin. 
SPOONER Yeah.    I can see you're all broken up. 
Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism. 
ROBERTSON Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company. We developed the "Three Laws of Robotics" together. But these days science is a young man's game. By the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you. Some of us are kicked upstairs. Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky. 
Robertson stands.   Meeting over. 
ROBERTSON Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life. I trust you will come to the same swift conclusion, Detective. Dr. Lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions. 
Spooner looks over at Calvin. 
SPOONER I want her to help me. 
Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement. 
CALVIN That's not really my department... 
ROBERTSON (pointed) Susan would be happy to assist you. 
And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin. The last one to get up. 
17   INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY                                      17 
Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS... 
SPOONER (under his breath) Ah, Christ...Toasters... 
As they duck under the police tape and... 
18   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                   18 
...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS, running across... 
HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out around his contorted lips. 
Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere. Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by... 
SERGEANT They say the price's gonna come down a lot next year. Kinda cool, huh? 
SPOONER How cool will it be when one takes your job? 
Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around. 
CALVIN Is everything alright, Detective? 
SPOONER Yeah. This is just how I like my robots -- in pieces. 
As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them. 
BALDEZ (to Spooner) Can you believe it, man? U.S. Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever see the inside of this building. 
Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it, awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND... 
SPOONER What's the run-down? 
BALDEZ Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four years old. Weapon a small caliber .22, registered in his name. Looks like he walked in, locked the door, and snuffed himself. 
Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face. 
SPOONER I know someone who disagrees with you.

THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded shirts...pants...socks...and hear \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good. \nJIM (O.S.) Yeah, I'm the best, baby. \nNow we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional glimpses of what looks like -- \nJIM (O.S.)(CONT'D) ...oh -- that was a tit, tits... \nAs most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is possible to watch the pay channels while they're scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17, short, horny. \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Give it to me!  Yes! \nJIM Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you. \nJim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe. We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next to Jim on his bed.  \"Cosmopolitan\" is open to a sexy model...a yearbook is open to the \"girl's swim team\" section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the \"Vagina\" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram. \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Don't you love my sexy body?! \nJIM I do, baby, I do. \nHe frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off the floor. \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) You're so big! \nJIM Yeah, that's right. \nPORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.) (deep macho voice) Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl! \nJim is thrown off. \nPORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D) Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad! \nJIM Man, shut up! \nSuddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's oblivious to his doings. \nJIM'S MOM Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say sweet dreams. \nJIM Yep, okay Mom, 'night. \nJIM'S MOM (leans in to Jim) Kiss goodnight. \nJim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss. She turns to leave, and notices the TV. \nJIM'S MOM (CONT'D) Is something wrong with the reception? \nJIM Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch. \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Fuck me!  Yes! \nJIM Uh... \nHe hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE, but instead the VOLUME GOES UP. \nPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!! \nJim panics as his mom reacts, shocked. \nJIM (choking) Must...be...broken... \nJIM'S DAD enters. \nJIM'S DAD What the heck is this? \nJIM Nothing! \nJIM'S MOM I think he's trying to watch one of the illegal channels. \nJIM Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal! They're pay channels.  How could a television channel be illegal?!  God, get a clue! \nJIM'S DAD James, don't speak that way to your mother! \nThe Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, \"hilariously\" attempting to play their instruments from the wrong end.  The guys shudder. \nOZ (to Jim) You guys got the Latin homework? \nJIM No -- Kevin, you? \nKEVIN (offended) Please. (then) We're all golden, we're college bound. I figured it out -- I can get a c- minus in every class, and it's not gonna make a difference.  U of M, here I come. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL NEAR POP MACHINE - DAY \nVicky is talking with JESSICA, a friend of hers, getting a pop (we're in the Midwest now, gang) from the machine. \nVICKY Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M. \nJESSICA Yeah right. \nVICKY What?  We both have cars. \nJESSICA Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet. \nVICKY That's not why we're going out. \nJESSICA What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies? \nVICKY Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment. \nJESSICA Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up? \nVICKY (offended, a la Kevin) Please. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin, Jim, and Oz are still walking down the hall. PAUL FINCH, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench. \nJIM There's our man. \nKEVIN Finch, you got the Latin homework? \nFINCH Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit. \nThe guys keep staring.  A beat. \nKEVIN Whatever. \nSomeone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part of the group. \nSTIFLER (yelling) NOVA!! \nOZ Stifler!! \nStifler runs full-force into Oz, grabbing him in a bear hug. \nSTIFLER You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface? \nOZ Depends if my date wants to stop by. \nSTIFLER That junior chick? \nOZ Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new. \nSTIFLER Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em. \nOZ Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick! \nSTIFLER Bullshit.  From where? \nOZ She works part-time at my dad's store. \nSTIFLER Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store. \nOZ Dude, he does not. \nKEVIN Really, Stifler.  He's the manager. \nOz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue. \nSTIFLER Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm fuckin' impressed.  I mean, \"Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat,\" that's some serious shit to master. \nOz musters a little LAUGH. \nKEVIN (half-joking) Stifler, you're such an asshole. \nSTIFLER Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd. \nFINCH Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool? \nSTIFLER (momentarily puzzled) I do when I'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak. (then) Alright then, see you guys tonight. I'll look for you in the No Fucking section. \nKEVIN The difference is so phenomenal, I can't decide. \nEXT. DOG DAYS - MAGIC HOUR - CONTINUING \nThey exit the restaurant. \nJIM What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base. \nKEVIN You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base? \nOZ (holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude. \nKEVIN Then where does a blowjob figure in? \nThey ponder this for a moment. \nOZ Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out. \nJIM So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like? \nKEVIN Oh, man, that's kind of sad. \nJim shrugs, embarrassed. \nOZ Feels like warm apple pie, dude. \nJIM Apple pie... (then) McDonald's or homemade? \nThey just look at him.  Finch hops on his scooter. \nFINCH Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia. \nHe MEEPS his horn and buzzes away. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFor a high-school party, it's pretty good.  The house is peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.  MUSIC blends with the din of excited conversation. \nKevin and Jim are drinking beers.  Around them, students mingle and flirt.  CHUCK SHERMAN comes up. \nSHERMAN What's up, fellas? \nJIM Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes. \nSHERMAN Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. \nJIM You've got something going? \nSHERMAN Did you see that Central chick? Brunette? \nKEVIN/JIM No. \nSHERMAN She's around.  Seems that she's taken a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time that she experienced -- The Sherminator. \nKEVIN Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever. \nSHERMAN I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent back through time...to change the future for one lucky lady. \nKEVIN Yeah man, right on! \nSherman saunters off into the party. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) (shakes his head) Hopeless. \nVicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys, EXCHANGING GREETINGS.  Jim spots NADIA across the room. She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman. \nJIM Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia. \nVICKY You like her?  Her sponsor family lives on my block.  Why don't you talk to her? \nJIM What would I say? \nVICKY Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on. \nKEVIN (to Jim) Gotta go. \nJIM But -- \nKevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim sees Nadia approaching him.  He freaks. \nJIM (cont'd) Kevin, get back here! \nBut he's gone.  And Nadia is now in front of him.  With no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big. \nNADIA (with a really sexy accent) You are in my English class, no? \nJim smiles. \nOZ There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something. \nAt this, she snuggles up to him.  Oz smiles confidently. \nOZ (CONT'D) Suck me, beautiful. \nThe College Chick backs off, confounded. \nCOLLEGE CHICK What did you just say? \nOZ (not so confidently) Suck me...beautiful? \nThe College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  She tries to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter. \nCOLLEGE CHICK What?! \nOz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just had the rug pulled from under him. \nOZ Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova. \nCOLLEGE CHICK You need some work, buddy! \nShe bursts into laughter.  Oz is ill. \nOZ Well...jeez, don't laugh at me. \nSeeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself. \nCOLLEGE CHICK Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all. \nOZ Like what? \nShe sees that he's lost.  Almost feels sorry for him. \nCOLLEGE CHICK Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic. \nOZ ...okay... \nCOLLEGE CHICK You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal. \nOZ I'm not good in math. \nShe's trying not to laugh again. \nCOLLEGE CHICK Come on, I'll drop you off at your friends'. \nOz couldn't be humiliated any further. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME \nOz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim, Stifler, and some guys. \nSTIFLER (hysterical, toppling over) You actually said that?!  Haaaah!! \nOZ Shut the fuck up. \nJIM Hey, you did better than I did, Nova. \nOZ Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud. \nSTIFLER This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a little hottie. \nStifler strides into another room. \nSTIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd) (yelling) Suck me, beautiful! \nOz wallows in his beer can, beaten. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know. \nVICKY (brief pause) Let me know. \nKEVIN Okay, don't stop. \nShe resumes.  A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to lose it. \nKEVIN (cont'd) Oh -- Now! \nWith awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin frantically searches for a receptacle.  He grabs a nearby cup of beer. \nEXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT \nInsert -- A hand pumping up the keg.  A fresh beer foams out into the cup. \nGUY #1 There we go. \nStifler barfs even more violently. \nEXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT \nJessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg. Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup. \nVICKY He likes it. \nJESSICA Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period? \nVICKY I think I've had one. \nJESSICA Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex. (starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually? \nVICKY ...I've never tried it. \nJESSICA Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse? \nVicky shrugs. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off. (noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am I right or what, Nadia? \nNADIA (no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary. \nJESSICA (to Vicky) See? \nNADIA In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.  I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh. \nNadia walks off. \nJESSICA No wonder she never pays attention in class. \nVicky nods, traumatized. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER \nKevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM on the wall.  Very attractive, late 30's. \nJIM Shit, I can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler. \nTWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this. \nFRESHMAN GUY Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF! \nFRESHMAN GUY #2 What the hell is that? \nFRESHMAN GUY M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck! \nSuddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches.  Sherman pokes his head out. \nSHERMAN (hushed, to guys) Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact?  I've got company.  Know what I mean? \nIn the bedroom in the background, we see the Central Girl.  Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there, dumbstruck. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nJim and Kevin are coming down the stairs. \nKEVIN (snapping) Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really fucking pissed. \nThey turn the corner into the kitchen. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING \nKEVIN Man, I just gotta get laid already! This blowjob thing is bullshit! \nHe stops.  Vicky is there with Jessica.  Staring at him. Vicky quietly grabs her purse.  Hurt.  OTHER STUDENTS watch, silently.  Kevin doesn't know what to say. \nVICKY Jessica, can you drive me home? \nJESSICA Sure. \nThe guys watch as the girls head for the door. \nKEVIN Vicky, wait. \nVICKY Not for you. \nThe girls exit.  Nobody says anything.  Kevin is in shock. \nPARTY GUY (O.S.) Yeti!  I am the Yeti! \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe next morning.  The party is long over.  Plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed. \nJim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin. \nSTIFLER (wandering down from upstairs) What the hell are you losers doing? \nThey all stop.  Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth.  A goatee of dried toothpaste. \nFINCH If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow? \nStifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green and heads back upstairs. \nINT. DOG DAYS - DAY \nThe guys are finishing up breakfast.  Hot dogs & eggs. \nKEVIN Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch. \nFinch gives a wistful \"Who, me?\" \nKEVIN (CONT'D) So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. \nOZ Dude, prom sucks. \nKEVIN I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it. \nJIM Yeah, it's like tradition or something. \nKEVIN Right.  That gives us... \nJIM Exactly three weeks to the day. \nThey take this in with some trepidation. \nKEVIN Alright then.  It's official.  Any questions? \nThere are none.  Kevin raises his Pepsi. \nKEVIN (cont'd) To the next step. \nThe guys raise their drinks. \nALL To the next step. \nThey toast.  And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING FOR SEX MONTAGE: \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow pages.  Finds a \"Floral Delivery\" listing.  Kevin dials. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together, which Kevin takes.  They part ways. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nOz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than that, he's doing absolutely nothing. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, \"E- DATE:  We Make Love Happen.\"  As Jim fiddles with the camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image. He clicks an onscreen-button labeled \"FREEZE IMAGE\" -- the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace. The screen reads, \"IMAGE SENT.\" \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY \nKevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the \"Religion\" section.  Surrounded by piles of different bibles.  No luck. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last bit of mustard. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJim is on his computer.  The screen reads \"YOU HAVE 00 REPLIES.\"  Jim is nonplussed. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's locker, holding their backpacks open.  Kevin holds a big shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the guys' packs are full of various condom boxes. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously examining them. \nAnd THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING. \nJIM (shoving the rubbers into his night table) Just a minute! \nHe opens the bedroom door.  Jim's Dad is standing there. \nJESSICA You got it, stud. \nKEVIN Well...I'm pretty sure I've -- \nJESSICA (interrupts authoritatively) No you haven't. \nKEVIN But that one time -- \nJESSICA (shaking head) No. \nKEVIN Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her? \nJESSICA Do you? \nKEVIN Of course. \nJESSICA Do you love her? \nKevin squirms. \nKEVIN I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that. \nJESSICA Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped. \nKEVIN I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it. \nJESSICA Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O. \nSuddenly Stifler comes running up, breathless. \nSTIFLER Dickhead!  You gotta see this. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER \nThe VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. \"Love You Like I Do\"). Singing with the group is none other than Oz.  He's not doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various vocal jazz girls.  Smiling at them, giving suave little waves. \nKevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the auditorium, listening. \nJIM This is unexpected. \nSTIFLER What did you cocks do to him?  Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll kick Oz off the team on principle alone. \nThe song finishes.  Oz bounds up to the other guys. \nOZ Hey guys, you came to watch me in action? \nJIM Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good. \nSTIFLER I think you need your balls reattached. \nOZ Keep it down, dude. \nSTIFLER What the fuck are you doing here? \nOZ This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot. \nANGLE ON SOME VOCAL JAZZ GIRLS \nA few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom is HEATHER -- conservative-looking, cute. \nVOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1 Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian singing with us. \nVOCAL JAZZ GIRL #2 Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on his forehead. \nHEATHER I think he's got a nice voice. \nVOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1 (ribbing her) Go talk to him, maybe you can teach him how to read. \nHeather shakes her head.  BACK TO: \nSTIFLER You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss? \nOZ Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me. \nOz waves goodbye to a final choir girl. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - LATER \nFinch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree. Kevin and Jim approach. \nKEVIN This is your plan, Finch? \nFINCH Yep. \nHe turns a page.  Skims the articles.  A beat. \nKEVIN This.  Right now. \nKEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.) It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that.  And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it. \nKevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various bibles on the bottom shelf. \nKEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd) After a couple years, guys started adding their own techniques.  Things they figured out themselves. \nKevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of the shelf.  Slides it out. \nKEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd) You have to keep it a secret, and return it at the end of the year.  So, now you know.  Good luck. \nThere, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over it, someone has written \"The Bible.\" \nRemember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's like that right now. \nKevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes. And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the date it was added. \nKevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly runs his hand down the empty page. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nJim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his shoulder. \nJIM (yells) Mom?!  I'm home! \nNo response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note: \"Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late. Enjoy!  Love Mom.\" \nJim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as a quizzical look spreads across his face. \nAfter a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency. \nThen Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like it's... well, not a pie. \nEXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY \nJim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING \nJim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks. His face drops, appalled. \nJIM'S DAD Jim? \nJIM It's not what it looks like! \nCUT TO: \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nJim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at the table.  Jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  Jim's dad is crushed.  You've never seen such disappointment... but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake. \nIn the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated. Mushed up, ruined...violated. \nJIM'S DAD (fighting back tears) I guess...we'll just tell your mother...that we ate it all. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLate.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the Bible. \nIf all students studied the way Kevin's studying this book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher cave paintings. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY \nThe Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing along, really making it look like he's into it.  He closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal \"scat\" to tag the number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good. \nOz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed. \nThe CHOIR TEACHER is a smartly-dressed black woman. \nCHOIR TEACHER What the hell was that? \nOZ Sorry. \nCHOIR TEACHER No, it was good. \nOZ Oh, well... (noticing Heather looking at him, he acts \"sensitive\") It came from the heart. \nCHOIR TEACHER Well then keep it coming. (to everyone) Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition. \nRehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz. \nHEATHER Not bad, Chris. \nOZ (surprised himself) Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right? \nHEATHER Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there. \nOZ (no idea) Yeah.  Right, uh-huh. (then, back into it) I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive. \nVicky wrestles with her own ecstacy.  Groans.  Kevin keeps referencing The Bible.  Whatever he's doing, it's working. \nINT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nVicky's dad approaches the bedroom door. \nINT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nVicky is about to explode.  She pulls the pillow off her face, gasping. \nINT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nVicky's dad reaches for the doorknob. \nVICKY (O.S.) I'M COMING! \nVicky's dad shrugs, turns around, and heads back downstairs. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's door. \nJIM Hey, dad.  Did you knock? \nJim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then he turns around, like he just realized the door was open. \nJIM'S DAD Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol' family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a good one. \nJim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall and looks at the portrait.  A beat. \nJIM'S DAD (CONT'D) Son, I wanted to talk to you about what I think you were trying to do the other day. \nJim's face drops, seeing his death unfold. \nJIM'S DAD (CONT'D) (continuing with his prepared speech) Now, you may have tried it in the shower, or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing. Or perhaps you've heard your friends talking about it in the locker room. \nJim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide. \nJIM Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about. \nJIM'S DAD Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. (a beat) You do want a partner, don't you son? \nJIM (through clenched teeth) Yes. \nJIM'S DAD That's great.  Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it -- (elbows Jim) \"Stroke the salami!\" (chuckles) Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate. \nNauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat. \nJIM'S DAD (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one. \nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY \nThe football field also doubles as the lacrosse field. East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game, muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing very tough. \nOn the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then excited to see Oz dodge his opponents. \nFinally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate each other. \nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY \nAfter the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL snags him -- \nCOACH MARSHALL Good work, Ostreicher. \nOZ Thanks coach. \nCOACH MARSHALL You're a killer, Ozzy! \nOZ (trying to get away) -- Thanks, coach -- \nFOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in mud. \nOZ Hey, what're you doing here? \nHEATHER Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, \"kicked butt.\" \nA clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's skirt. \nOZ (brushing it off her skirt) Whoops, excuse me... \nOz wipes the mud from his hands.  A beat.  Heather has something to say that's not quite coming out. \nHEATHER Um...Chris -- \nOZ You can call me Oz. \nHEATHER Do I have to? \nKEVIN (cont'd) Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul Finch is? \nRANDOM CUTE GIRL Of course!  Have you guys seen his tattoo? \nKEVIN ...Yes? \nRANDOM CUTE GIRL Is it cool?  I heard it was like an eagle, blazing in fire and stuff. \nJIM (nods, loving it) Actually, it's an eagle and this big python. \nRANDOM CUTE GIRL Really?! \nJIM Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here, and the eagle -- the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the snake is like his -- \nKEVIN (interrupting) That's good, Jim. \nRANDOM CUTE GIRL Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool! \nShe hurries off to tell her friends.  The guys exit the classroom. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR HIGH LOCKERS - CONTINUING \nOZ Okay, explain. \nKEVIN I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together. \nJIM (a little aggravated) Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it. \nJim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in front of him.  Jim says nothing.  Stuck.  Staring.  Oz elbows him.  Jim gives a startled GRUNT. \nNADIA You are very good in the world history class, yes? \nJIM (gulps) Me? \nJim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him encouraging looks and gestures. \nJIM (CONT'D) (trying to decipher the guys' signals) Yes.  No.  Yes. \nNADIA Perhaps you can help me with my studies? \nThe guys nod, \"Yes!  Yes!\" \nJIM Okay...that would be cool sometime. (sees the guys gesticulating) How 'bout tomorrow? \nNADIA Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place? \nJIM (barely, overwhelmed) I suppose that would be okay. \nNadia walks off.  Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  They pat him heartily in congratulations. \nEXT. RAST GREAT FALLS - SIDE OF SCHOOL - DAY \nAfter school.  Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new Saab. \nOZ Nice car. \nHEATHER I'm glad you think so. \nOZ You don't like it? \nHEATHER No, I like the car. (then, direct) By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you. \nShe hastily walks towards the school. \nOZ What?! \nHEATHER Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk. \nOZ What?  No I'm not. \nHEATHER I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies. \nOZ I wasn't making fun of you. \nHEATHER Give me a break, you're so full of it. \nShe hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the school.  After a moment, he slowly heads in. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER \nOz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement of \"HOW SWEET IT IS.\"  It sounds jazzy, cool. \nOz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is hooked. \nThe Choir Teacher halts the song. \nCHOIR TEACHER Okay, Heather, that was good, but I want to thicken up that solo. Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke. \nJim's dad gives a knowing look and exits. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nSTIFLER'S YOUNGER BROTHER, 11, a monster, is tugging at Stifler, who sits at the computer, watching Jim's room. \nSTIFLER'S BROTHER Steve!  Steve!  It's my computer and I wanna use it! \nSTIFLER Shut up and watch this, you might learn something. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJIM So you need to change, right? \nNADIA Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable. \nShe sets her duffel on Jim's bed. \nJIM No, go right ahead and get dressed. I'll just be downstairs, studying up. Get me when you're ready. \nJim exits, closing the door behind him. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME \nKEVIN Here we go. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING \nHe's off!  Jim sprints down the hall.  Thunders down the stairs. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING \nJim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs.  Jim bolts through the room. \nJIM Be back in a sec! \nHe practically crashes through the door on his way out. \nJIM'S MOM Jim?  Honey, where are you going? \nShe turns and looks at her husband.  Both perplexed. \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUING \nJim runs like hell. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nNadia unzips her duffel, pulling some clothes out. \nEXT. KEVIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUING \nJim trucks across the lawn to the door. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKevin and Finch are watching the computer screen. \nKEVIN Want a beer? \nFinch simply waves off the question.  He's glued to the screen. \nJim bursts into the room, breathless. \nJIM Did I miss anything?! \nKEVIN Just in time. \nJim grabs a seat by the computer.  All three guys watch, transfixed.  Nadia is slipping out of her leotard. \nJIM Woah! \nNadia's leotard is off.  Bra and panties.  Outstanding body. \nINTERCUT BETWEEN JIM'S BEDROOM and the guys around the computer screen in Kevin's Bedroom. \nNadia pauses.  Looks in Jim's full-length mirror. Admiring her body. \nKEVIN Oh, man!  This is incredible. \nAnd...yes!  Nadia peels off her sportsbra.  Supple breasts.  The guys are awestruck. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) I can't believe Oz had to work. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY \nOz sits alone in the empty vocal jazz rehearsal area.  He sighs, leafing through some sheet music.  It's as quiet and boring as can be. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKEVIN Oh no. \nINT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME \nThe stoners look...well, stoned. \nSTONER #1 Bummer. \nINT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nThe girls are LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. \nINT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nSTIFLER'S BROTHER What happened?!  What happened?! \nSTIFLER He blew it.  Literally. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nNadia is getting dressed. \nNADIA You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now. \nJIM No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you. \nShe sees the desperation in his eyes.  Thinks about it. Smiles. \nNADIA I do like your dirty magazines. \nJim digs into the stack of pornos.  Grabs SHAVED. \nJIM Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine. \nNADIA Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me... \nJIM Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you. \nShe goes for this line.  Gives in. \nNADIA Oh Jim... \nShe grabs him.  Starts caressing his body. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKEVIN/FINCH Yes!! \nINT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME \nSTONER #1 Alright, dude! \nINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY \nGUY #1 He's re-engaging! \nA CHEER goes up as the guys CELEBRATE. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nGroping.  They're tangled in each other.  Nadia backs off for a moment.  Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in the sides of her panties.  Starts sliding them down. \nNADIA So, \"shaved\" is the expression? \nCLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out.  Yep, it is, and she is. \nJIM (mutters) Holy shit. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKEVIN Holy shit! \nINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY \nALL THE GUYS (unison) HOLY SHIT! \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim is stuck.  Staring at Nadia.  She moves towards him. Nadia is inches from his face. \nNADIA Touch me Jim...here. \nJim is trembling, straining with himself.  A shudder runs through him. \nAnd it's over, again. \nJIM (interrupting) What was your name again? \nMICHELLE Michelle. \nJIM Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? \nMICHELLE Really?  You seriously want to go with me? \nJIM (so forced) Yes.  Seriously. \nMICHELLE Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool. \nJIM Whatever you want. \nMICHELLE Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER \nHeather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the door she sees Oz.  She stops. \nOz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated -- \nOZ Dammit! \nHe whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils, still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again. Heather is impressed. \nINT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nVicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on, rubbing her shoulders. \nKEVIN You're not doing the extra credit problems. \nVICKY No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April. \nKEVIN That's my trick! \nVICKY It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you. \nShe gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious. \nKEVIN We've come a long way since Homecoming. \nVICKY (playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. \nKEVIN Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. \nVicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk, facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic. \nVICKY Like how? \nKEVIN Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them. \nVICKY I think you're so right, Kevin. \nKEVIN (pause) You want to do it? \nVICKY Yes -- \nShe takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares. \nVICKY (CONT'D) I love you. \nKevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response. \nVICKY (CONT'D) Kevin?  Do you not love me? \nKEVIN No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special. \nVICKY But you don't love me. \nKEVIN I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going \"I was wrong.\" \nA beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from. \nVICKY Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents. \nKEVIN I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay? \nVICKY Okay. \nINT. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nOz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised, embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them. \nHEATHER Hi... \nOZ How did you know I was here? \nPure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut eyes. \nA gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nWe hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her friend in surprise. \nGIRL #2 Joanie, was that you? \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's no use.  He's at his limit. \nFINCH Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh! \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nThe girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet bowl. \nThe girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nFinch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever happened, he opens it. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY \nFinch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes register complete disbelief. \nA SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY \nOz is playing in the final lacrosse game.  The team scores -- they're beating Central.  Everyone cheers, except Oz.  We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING. \nEXT. MUSIC HALL (MSU) - DAY \nEstablishing.  The campus of Michigan State University. Students pass in front of an older, impressive university building. \nA sign out front reads, \"MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL COMPETITION.\" \nINT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY \nHeather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind the curtain. \nThey all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might come running in. \nVOCAL JAZZ TEACHER Okay.  Albert, you ready? \nALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny- looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as plain weird. \nALBERT No problemo. \nHe SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and cheesy.  Heather looks trapped. \nEXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY \nA scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals. Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead. Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball. Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground, as Stifler recovers the ball and scores. \nThe players run back to the sidelines to reset for the face-off, and gather around the coach. \nCOACH MARSHALL Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.  You all saw what happened to Oz out there.  I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score.  You don't score until you score, period. \nThe team is getting into it.  Shouts of \"Hell yeah!\"  But Oz's got a quizzical look on his face. \nINT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY \nHeather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself. \nALBERT Focus on the music.  Think melody. Let the music be my guide. \nHEATHER That would be a start. \nEXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY \nOz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused. \nCOACH MARSHALL It all boils down to today.  For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years.  Think of what that means to you.  Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? \nA wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall. \nCOACH MARSHALL (cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher! \nOz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath. \nFINCH Me too.  For the most part. \nKEVIN Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing. \nJIM Come on man.  Tonight is the night. We're finally going to a post-prom party on the lake.  We've been waiting to do this for the last four years. Why else are we still friends with Stifler?  You gotta go. \nA beat as Kevin ponders this. \nOZ And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid. \nKEVIN He didn't? \nFINCH Nope.  He pissed himself. \nThe guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus pulls in front of the school. \nJIM There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date. \nOZ Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you. \nJim holds out a helping hand.  Kevin looks at it.  Grabs it, and Jim pulls him up. \nEXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nA beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan. Students are filing out of the charter bus. \nJim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage. \nJIM Stifler's mom got it in the divorce. \nMICHELLE It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any. \nJIM Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp. \nMICHELLE Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me. \nJIM Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And... \nINT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM \nKevin leads Vicky into the bedroom.  A large bay window overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan. \nKEVIN See -- this is the nicest room. \nVICKY Wow, Kev...it's perfect. \nVicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother inside, grinning. \nSTIFLER'S BROTHER You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!? \nKEVIN No!  Get out of here! \nSTIFLER'S BROTHER (running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers! \nStiflers brother is gone.  They LAUGH...and Vicky closes the door. \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nOz and Heather are walking down the beach.  Holding hands.  Deep in the background, we see kids partying. \nOZ There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather. \nHEATHER What's that? \nOZ It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. \nShe nods.  They stop walking.  Oz swipes his feet around in the sand. \nOZ (cont'd) See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin, Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact. That we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over. \nHeather is listening. \nOZ (cont'd) And, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it. \nHEATHER This isn't the best way to proposition me. \nOZ No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score. \nHEATHER This isn't any better, Chris. \nOZ No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but -- \nHe takes her hand. \nOZ (cont'd) I feel like I've already won. \nHeather softens, taken off guard. \nVICKY You sure you're comfortable? \nKEVIN Yeah.  Are you sure? \nVICKY Yeah. \nKEVIN Me too. \nVICKY Okay. (a beat) Did you bring a condom? \nKEVIN Yeah, right here. \nHe pulls out a condom.  A beat as they contemplate it. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it? \nVICKY I don't know.  How do you? \nKEVIN Like, normal style.  The...missionary position. \nVICKY Okay. \nA moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but - \nVICKY (cont'd) Kevin... \nKEVIN Yeah Vick? \nVICKY I want to hear you say it. \nKEVIN Okay. \nKevin swallows hard.  And says -- \nKEVIN (CONT'D) Victoria...I love you. \nVICKY I love you. \nThey both take a deep breath. \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nOz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes, surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring breeze.  Stars and a lustrous moon above. \nThe silence speaks.  We can see it in their eyes. Yearning. \nOZ I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy. \nHEATHER Then don't. \nThey kiss.  It's time. \nINT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA brief moment of uncertainty.  Kevin shifts around a bit, trying to position himself.  Vicky's hand goes under the sheets. \nVICKY Here. \nWe know what she's doing.  They both maintain eye contact... \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nHeather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion. Discovering love.  This is the stuff that you thought only existed in romance novels.  Seriously. \nINT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT \nJim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel. \nJIM So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds? \nMICHELLE Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny! \nJIM (flat) Okay, I get it. \nMICHELLE Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy. \nJim CHOKES on his beer.  Michelle considers her revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as Jim struggles to recover. \nJIM ...excuse me?! \nMICHELLE What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed! \nJim is ga-ga.  He watches in disbelief as she lets her hair down.  And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute. \nMICHELLE (cont'd) So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm getting kind of antsy. \nJim pauses in disbelief.  Then -- \nWhat we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified. \nSTIFLER Ugh...oh no... \nHe looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes out. \nEXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING \nThe sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day. Various students are passed out here and there. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nOz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful. SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore. \nOz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe to the world. \nINT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around. \nJIM She's gone. \nHe considers this. \nJIM (cont'd) Oh my God.  She used me. \nHe considers this further.  Smiles. \nJIM (cont'd) Wow!  I was used!  Cool! \nHe jumps up and does a little dance, SINGING... \nJIM (CONT'D) Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail! to the conquering heroes, hail... \nINT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY \nKevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking through. \nKEVIN That was a great night. \nVICKY Yeah. \nA beat. \nKEVIN I can't believe we just had our senior prom. \nVICKY Yeah, the time went by so fast. \nKEVIN It did. \nAnother beat. \nVICKY Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it. \nKEVIN Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but -- \nVICKY (interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything. \nKevin thinks this over. \nKEVIN It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people... \nA moment as they think this over. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying. \nVICKY I know. (a beat) Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends? \nKEVIN What? \nVICKY Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev! \nKevin gives an embarrassed smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOG DAYS - DAY \nA sign on the window reads, \"Congratulations Seniors!\" \nINT. DOG DAYS - DAY \nThe four, newly non-virgins munch on hot dogs.  Kevin's LAUGHING. \nKEVIN (to Jim) I guess we'll call you two-ply. \nOZ Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that? \n", "test1_input": "INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME \nA GROUP OF STONERS log onto the page.  A LITTLE MONKEY hops around in a cage. \nSTONER #1 Whoa. \nSTONER #2 Kind. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING \nJim still waits outside his bedroom door.  Takes a deep breath.  Looks upwards to the sky. \nJIM Please, God.  Let this be it. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKEVIN He's going in! \nINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY \nWe see a bedroom full of GUYS. \nGUY #1 There's somebody going in there! \nINT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME \nSTONER #1 Hey, that guy's in my trig class. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim stands there, bewildered.  Nadia hasn't noticed him, eyes closed, still pleasuring herself.  Jim stands there, watching, faltering.  Gathers his courage.  Finally, he rolls his eyes and says -- \nJIM Looks like you could use an extra hand. \nNadia's eyes flash open. \nNADIA (chastising) James!  You have come in here on purpose?! \nJIM Well...uh... \nNADIA Shame on you! \nJIM Uh...yeah...sorry. \nNADIA Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip. \nJIM Strip? \nNADIA Yes, slowly. \nJim sneaks a nervous glance over to the QuickCam. \nJIM You mean like, strip strip? \nNADIA (irresistably sexy) For me? \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME \nFINCH What do you suppose they're saying? \nKEVIN No idea. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING \nNadia leans over to Jim's clock radio.  Turns it on.  We hear COUNTRY MUSIC.  She flips the dial, and we hear A FEW STATIONS FLIP BY.  Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG. \nNADIA Perfect. \nShe turns to Jim. \nJIM Uh... \nNADIA Move with the music. \nJIM Um...okay... \nHe struts clumsily back and forth.  Takes his shirt off. Swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands. \nNADIA No, no, you must put your whole body into it. \nJIM Nadia, I can't -- \nNADIA Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James. \nJim nods eagerly.  Concentrates on the music...as we see the shirt slide off the camera.  Jim starts writhing to the beat.

JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING \nJim tugs off his pants, dancing and tripping on them. \nNADIA (turned on) More sexy, Jim, more sexy. \nJim is clearly excited by Nadia's prodding.  He does some pathetically ridiculous move with his pants, sliding them around his chest and neck. \nINT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING \nA GROUP OF GIRLS is watching. \nDISINTERESTED GIRL He's no Paul Finch. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME \nKevin and Finch are now completely sickened. \nFINCH This is truly revolting. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING \nJim is straddled over a chair, grinding against the chair back, in his boxers and shorts. \nNADIA (getting really turned on) More, more, you bad boy! \nJim starts spanking his ass as he gyrates. \nINT.

Hames, come to me. \nJIM Oh yeah! \nJim dances over to her.  She pulls him onto the bed. Kisses his neck.  Takes his hand.  Places it on her thigh. \nNADIA Be gentle. \nJim GULPS. \nINT.

JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim's hand wanders up Nadia's leg.  She does the same to him.  Blows in his ear.  Her hand is about to enter his shorts. \nAnd Jim is done.  Bang.  That's it. \nHe looks down at himself in terror.  Nadia sees.  Backs away. \nNADIA Jim... \nJIM Oh no. \n", "test2_input": "KEVIN Hey...what was that all about? \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.

EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY \nKevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY \nKevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the center of the page -- Jessica. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nKevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line. \nJESSICA No comment. \nKEVIN No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! \nJESSICA Thanks.  It was my idea. \nKEVIN Did you guys hook up or something? \nJESSICA Are you kidding?  No. \nKEVIN Then what the hell are you talking about? \nJESSICA Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, \"Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera.\"  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did. \nKEVIN I don't get it, that really works? \nJESSICA Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman? \nKevin is speechless. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) No?  Damn, that one was my favorite. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GUY'S SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nToweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT FALLS LACROSSE CHANT.  They exit frame, and we remain on the showers, to hear -- \nOZ (singing happily) ...I needed the shelter of someone's arms...there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo... \nHe exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to Stifler. \nOZ (CONT'D) (still singing) ...I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were... \nStifler is staring at Oz, horrified. \nSTIFLER Oh my fucking God.  You're gay. \nOZ (cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along. \nSTIFLER No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. \nOz stops. \nOZ Our last game is this Saturday. \nSTIFLER No shit. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER \nHeather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her, breathless, his hair still wet. \nOZ ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... \nHEATHER (pause) You can't sing at the competition. \nOZ I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it... \nHEATHER (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. \nOZ Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later. \nAn uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks let down. \nEXT.

Stifler comes running up with a wicked grin on his face. \n", "test2_true": "KEVIN (immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do? \nSTIFLER Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore. \nStifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him. \nKEVIN Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now! \nFINCH Easy, tiger.  What's in there? \nKEVIN Just go! \nFINCH Why is this? \nKEVIN You're gonna shit your pants! \nFINCH Charming. \nKEVIN Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast. \nFINCH First of all, it's Mochaccino, and secondly...Oohhhh! \nFinch jumps up and sprints down the hallway. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING \nWe FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall, holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman. \nSTIFLER This way, sit. \nFinch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS hysterically. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nFinch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining, struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he cramps up. \nHe grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his forehead. \nFINCH Come on come on come on... \nHe's got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper, placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over, still wriggling to contain his bowels. \nFINCH (CONT'D) Okay.  You can do this. \nHe unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining, listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK of heels. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY \nThe bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal symbol for \"Women.\"  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even harder. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth, straining. \nAnd a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nA GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair. \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations. \nGIRL #2 You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date. \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH No, I don't want a date... (increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag...and so am I...the guy is like so...debonair. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit. Holding it in for all he's worth. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGIRL #2 Do you think that \"older woman\" thing is true? \nGIRL #3 Of course, it was Stifler's mom. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \n", "test3_input": "INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY \nJim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well enough. \nHe turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting, trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and focused. \nINT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nVicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if she could care. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY \nFinch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest Gump. \nINT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY \nJim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered around him that he's already tried.  In the background, an ATTENDANT looks impatient. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY \nFinch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different angle. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie. \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE) \nKevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the mirror. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT \nThe parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles to re-attach his date's corsage. \nThis is the prom. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT \nThe gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner. Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY IMITATION ROCK MUSIC. \nMost students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them down, futilely. \nThe band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies. \nANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE \nThey're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused. \nMICHELLE You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated? \nJIM Highly, highly overrated. \nANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY \nThey dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious. \nANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER \nDancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace. Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed. \nANGLE ON STIFLER \nDancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - A CORNER OF THE GYM - NIGHT \nKevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out.  Finch is drunk. \nFINCH Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb meeting. \nSherman passes by. \nSHERMAN I'm on the offensive, boys.  The Sherman Tank is going back in. \nThe guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central Girl nearby. \nSHERMAN (CONT'D) Locked on target, flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to drop the payload...again. \nSherman confidently walks off. \nKEVIN Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim? \nJIM My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question? \nKEVIN Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something? \nOZ (getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude? \n", "test3_true": "JIM Back out?  You don't need us to get laid.  You afraid or something? \nKEVIN No, but come on guys, we made a pact! \nOZ Kevin, it was just a -- \nKEVIN It was a pact.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to -- \nJIM (interrupting, pissed) I don't have to do shit!  Forget it already! \nKevin is taken aback. \nJIM (cont'd) I'm tired of all this bullshit pressure!  I mean, I've never even had sex and already I can't stand it!  I hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isn't that damn important!  So fuck this stupid pact, fuck you, and fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out with that geek over there, 'cause at least she's got something else to talk about besides sex!  God damn! \nKevin storms off.  A beat. \nFINCH At least I learned how to shit in school. \nJessica approaches.  She's dressed well, but not lavishly. \nJESSICA Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance? \nFinch looks to the guys.  They shrug.  We FOLLOW WITH Jessica and Finch as they dance out onto the floor. \nFINCH How come you have no date? \nJESSICA I like to keep my options open.  And let me just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch. \nFINCH No, of course not, don't be ridiculous. \nANGLE ON VICKY AND CENTRAL GIRL \nVICKY So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty close.  You met at that party a while back? \nCENTRAL GIRL Yeah, we were up the whole night together.  We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you really feel like you get to know someone. \nVICKY (nudge, nudge) \"Deep conversation,\" huh?  Is that what you guys call it? \nCENTRAL GIRL What else would I call it? \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT \nKevin sits on the steps into the school, depressed. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT \nThe Central Girl has taken over the band's microphone. \nCENTRAL GIRL Excuse me, everyone, sorry to interrupt. \nHer voice reverberates throughout the gym.  A couple WOLF- WHISTLES. \nCENTRAL GIRL (cont'd) I just wanted to let you all know this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I never had sex with him.  He's never had sex with anyone -- I know because he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he also told me that sometimes when he gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank you for your attention. \nGirls around the gym CHEER and APPLAUD. \nANGLE ON SHERMAN \nPissing his pants. \nANGLE ON JIM \nShocked.  He looks back to Oz, who shares his expression. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT \nKevin still sits there.  Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of the school.  Slowly they walk up to Kevin. \nOZ ...Guess what? \nKEVIN I don't care. \nJIM Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon. \nKEVIN I'm not going. \nA beat as the guys don't know what to say.  Kevin's speech is halting, downbeat. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) This isn't how I wanted things to turn out.  Making the pact wasn't just about getting laid.  It was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated.  But now I've just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what?  I don't even know. All I managed to do was fuck up our friendship. \nA beat.  Oz shrugs. \nOZ I still think you're okay. \nJIM So do I, Kev. \n"}

{"test1_input": "STIFLER (wandering down from upstairs) What the hell are you losers doing? \nThey all stop.  Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth.  A goatee of dried toothpaste. \nFINCH If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow? \nStifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green and heads back upstairs. \nINT. DOG DAYS - DAY \nThe guys are finishing up breakfast.  Hot dogs & eggs. \nKEVIN Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch. \nFinch gives a wistful \"Who, me?\" \nKEVIN (CONT'D) So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. \nOZ Dude, prom sucks. \nKEVIN I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it. \nJIM Yeah, it's like tradition or something. \nKEVIN Right.  That gives us... \nJIM Exactly three weeks to the day. \nThey take this in with some trepidation. \nKEVIN Alright then.  It's official.  Any questions? \nThere are none.  Kevin raises his Pepsi. \nKEVIN (cont'd) To the next step. \nThe guys raise their drinks. \nALL To the next step. \nThey toast.  And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING FOR SEX MONTAGE: \nINT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow pages.  Finds a \"Floral Delivery\" listing.  Kevin dials. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together, which Kevin takes.  They part ways. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nOz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than that, he's doing absolutely nothing. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, \"E- DATE:  We Make Love Happen.\"  As Jim fiddles with the camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image. He clicks an onscreen-button labeled \"FREEZE IMAGE\" -- the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace. The screen reads, \"IMAGE SENT.\" \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY \nKevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the \"Religion\" section.  Surrounded by piles of different bibles.  No luck. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last bit of mustard. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJim is on his computer.  The screen reads \"YOU HAVE 00 REPLIES.\"  Jim is nonplussed. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's locker, holding their backpacks open.  Kevin holds a big shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the guys' packs are full of various condom boxes. \nINT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously examining them. \nAnd THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING. \nJIM (shoving the rubbers into his night table) Just a minute! \nHe opens the bedroom door.  Jim's Dad is standing there. \n", "test1_true": "JIM Yeah, sure. \nJIM'S DAD You're not...busy? \nJIM Dad, come in. \nJim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag. He takes a seat on Jim's bed. \nJIM'S DAD (fatherly attempt) Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk. \nJim takes a seat next to his dad. \nJIM Okay. \nJIM'S DAD These are for you.  From father to son. \nJim looks at the bag.  Uncomfortable.  Hesitantly, he takes it.  Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of PERFECT 10. \nJIM Uh...dad... \nJim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father. \nJIM'S DAD Go ahead son, there's more. \nBeyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag.  Cringes. Pulls out a PENTHOUSE. \nJIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, that one's a little more...a little more...graphic. \nJIM I know, Dad. \nJIM'S DAD Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you. \nJim's Dad takes the bag back.  Pulls out a copy of SHAVED. \nJIM'S DAD (cont'd) This, son, is your more exotic dirty magazine. \nJIM Dad!  I know! \nJIM'S DAD Do you know about the clitoris? \nJIM (through clenched teeth) Yes dad. \nJIM'S DAD Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate. \nJIM (interrupting, hand up) Thank you, dad, I got it. \nJIM'S DAD Okay, well that about covers it. \nJim MURMURS something incomprehensible. \nJIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, let's put these somewhere where your mother won't find them. \nJim's Dad takes the stack of magazines.  He goes to open Jim's night table.  Jim freaks. \nJIM Wait! \nBut it's too late.  Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the unraveled prophylactics.  He sours. \nJIM'S DAD (beaten) I'll have to save this speech for another day.  I'm too worn out. \nJim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NEAR THE HALL OF FAME - DAY \nKevin is trying to talk to Vicky. \nKEVIN Did you get the flowers? (no response) What about the poem? \nShe doesn't care. \nKEVIN (cont'd) Vicky, please don't do this. \nVicky stares him right in the eye.  Strong. \nVICKY I'll think about it. \nShe slams her locker and walks off.  Jessica is nearby. She's overheard. \nJESSICA Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had. \nKEVIN What? \nJESSICA I'll give you a hint. (hot, orgasmic) \"Ohhh, yeah, yeah!\" (flat) Comprende? \nKEVIN You mean...and orgasm? \n", "test1_id": 558, "test2_input": "Vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy.  Groans.  Kevin keeps referencing The Bible.  Whatever he's doing, it's working. \nINT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nVicky's dad approaches the bedroom door. \nINT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nVicky is about to explode.  She pulls the pillow off her face, gasping. \nINT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nVicky's dad reaches for the doorknob. \nVICKY (O.S.) I'M COMING! \nVicky's dad shrugs, turns around, and heads back downstairs. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's door. \nJIM Hey, dad.  Did you knock? \nJim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then he turns around, like he just realized the door was open. \nJIM'S DAD Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol' family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a good one. \nJim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall and looks at the portrait.  A beat. \nJIM'S DAD (CONT'D) Son, I wanted to talk to you about what I think you were trying to do the other day. \nJim's face drops, seeing his death unfold. \nJIM'S DAD (CONT'D) (continuing with his prepared speech) Now, you may have tried it in the shower, or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing. Or perhaps you've heard your friends talking about it in the locker room. \nJim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide. \nJIM Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about. \nJIM'S DAD Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. (a beat) You do want a partner, don't you son? \nJIM (through clenched teeth) Yes. \nJIM'S DAD That's great.  Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it -- (elbows Jim) \"Stroke the salami!\" (chuckles) Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate. \nNauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat. \nJIM'S DAD (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one. \nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY \nThe football field also doubles as the lacrosse field. East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game, muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing very tough. \nOn the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then excited to see Oz dodge his opponents. \nFinally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate each other. \nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY \nAfter the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL snags him -- \nCOACH MARSHALL Good work, Ostreicher. \nOZ Thanks coach. \nCOACH MARSHALL You're a killer, Ozzy! \nOZ (trying to get away) -- Thanks, coach -- \nFOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in mud. \nOZ Hey, what're you doing here? \nHEATHER Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, \"kicked butt.\" \nA clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's skirt. \nOZ (brushing it off her skirt) Whoops, excuse me... \nOz wipes the mud from his hands.  A beat.  Heather has something to say that's not quite coming out. \nHEATHER Um...Chris -- \nOZ You can call me Oz. \nHEATHER Do I have to? \n", "test2_true": "HEATHER What's your middle name? \nOZ Forget it. \nHEATHER Come on!  I won't tell. \nOZ Neither will I. \nHEATHER Okay. (pause) So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone -- \nBefore she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and excited. \nSTIFLER Hah!  Central sucks! (noticing Heather) Choir Chick?  What the hell are you doing here? \nHEATHER Well, I uh, I was -- (decides to stand her ground) I was asking Chris to prom. (turns to Oz) So do you wanna go? \nOz is surprised at her directness.  Impressed. \nOZ Yeah! \nSTIFLER Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo. \nOZ Stifler, fuck -- (noticing Heather, \"sensitive\") ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive. \nA beat. \nSTIFLER What?? (he dismisses it) Whatever -- look uh, don't forget -- my cottage after prom.  On Lake Michigan. \nStifler joins some other LACROSSE BUDDIES. \nOZ Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good. \nHEATHER Yeah, me too, okay, cool. \nThey share a smile.  Then Heather walks off towards her car.  Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse guys. \nSTIFLER My man Oz, working it with the choir babes? \nLACROSSE BUDDIES (cheering, slapping him) Yeah, go Oz! etc. \nOz laughs, embarrassed. \nOZ (pandering to them) Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears. \nSTIFLER I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right? \nStifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank- Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance. \nSTIFLER (CONT'D) Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes! \nThe other guys LAUGH.  Oz joins in, laughing in spite of himself.  They all high-five. \nAnd from the other side of the field, we see Heather peering over at them.  Hardly believing it as Oz joins in the laughter. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY \nEnglish class.  The TEACHER is wrapping up a lecture. \nTEACHER So once Hal becomes king, he has to take on the responsibilities of leadership, and turn his back on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You see, Hal was going through a rite of passage, much like you all are.  Make the most of the time you've got left together.  You'll miss it later. \nJim, Kevin, and Oz sit in the back of the classroom in one corner. \nOZ So does your tongue cramp up? \nKEVIN Nah, you get kind of dizzy though. \nJIM Wow, that's amazing, she's probably gonna want to do it soon. \nKevin shrugs as the BELL RINGS.  Sherman passes by. \nSHERMAN Still questing after the holy grail, eh guys? \nHe CHUCKLES and exits.  The guys stand up, exiting the classroom. \nJIM Hey, where's Finch? \nKEVIN Went home to shit. \nJIM I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation? \nOZ What reputation? \nKEVIN Observe. \nHe taps a passing RANDOM CUTE GIRL on the shoulder. \n", "test2_id": 559, "test3_input": "KEVIN Hey...what was that all about? \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth, but you can't see it. \nKEVIN Right, and who told you that? \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY \nKevin is talking to GRETA.  She points offscreen. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY \nKevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY \nKevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the center of the page -- Jessica. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nKevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line. \nJESSICA No comment. \nKEVIN No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! \nJESSICA Thanks.  It was my idea. \nKEVIN Did you guys hook up or something? \nJESSICA Are you kidding?  No. \nKEVIN Then what the hell are you talking about? \nJESSICA Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, \"Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera.\"  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did. \nKEVIN I don't get it, that really works? \nJESSICA Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman? \nKevin is speechless. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) No?  Damn, that one was my favorite. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GUY'S SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nToweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT FALLS LACROSSE CHANT.  They exit frame, and we remain on the showers, to hear -- \nOZ (singing happily) ...I needed the shelter of someone's arms...there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo... \nHe exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to Stifler. \nOZ (CONT'D) (still singing) ...I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were... \nStifler is staring at Oz, horrified. \nSTIFLER Oh my fucking God.  You're gay. \nOZ (cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along. \nSTIFLER No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. \nOz stops. \nOZ Our last game is this Saturday. \nSTIFLER No shit. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER \nHeather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her, breathless, his hair still wet. \nOZ ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... \nHEATHER (pause) You can't sing at the competition. \nOZ I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it... \nHEATHER (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. \nOZ Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later. \nAn uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks let down. \nEXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - ENTRANCE TO SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY \nKevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  Stifler comes running up with a wicked grin on his face. \n", "test3_true": "KEVIN (immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do? \nSTIFLER Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore. \nStifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY \nFinch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him. \nKEVIN Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now! \nFINCH Easy, tiger.  What's in there? \nKEVIN Just go! \nFINCH Why is this? \nKEVIN You're gonna shit your pants! \nFINCH Charming. \nKEVIN Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast. \nFINCH First of all, it's Mochaccino, and secondly...Oohhhh! \nFinch jumps up and sprints down the hallway. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING \nWe FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall, holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman. \nSTIFLER This way, sit. \nFinch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS hysterically. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nFinch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining, struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he cramps up. \nHe grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his forehead. \nFINCH Come on come on come on... \nHe's got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper, placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over, still wriggling to contain his bowels. \nFINCH (CONT'D) Okay.  You can do this. \nHe unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining, listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK of heels. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY \nThe bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal symbol for \"Women.\"  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even harder. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth, straining. \nAnd a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY \nA GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair. \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations. \nGIRL #2 You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date. \nGIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH No, I don't want a date... (increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag...and so am I...the guy is like so...debonair. \nINT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY \nFinch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit. Holding it in for all he's worth. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nGIRL #2 Do you think that \"older woman\" thing is true? \nGIRL #3 Of course, it was Stifler's mom. \nINT.

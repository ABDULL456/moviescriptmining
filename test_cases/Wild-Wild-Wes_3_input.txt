The men run in opposite directions. (Gordon's belt on West's collar, West's boot on Gordon's). They get about thirty, forty yards. Then -- 
They're yanked backwards into each other. 
SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is under water. 
WEST (rolling face up) Get off me, you steaming pile of (GURGLE)! 
GORDON (rolling face up) I'm trying, you son of a (GURGLE)! 
WEST (rolling face upGURGLE)        you! 
GORDON (rolling face upGURGLE)    yourself! 
Finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land. They sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back. 
WEST I do not want to spend the rest of my life looking like a meatball on a plate. 
GORDON We're going to have to discuss bathroom etiquette soon. Very soon. 
ANGLE ON TOOL KIT 
bobbing in the stream.    Gordon grabs it out of the water. 
GORDON Aha. My auxiliary tool kit. I forgot all about it. It must've slipped out of my pocket. 
WEST Your pocket? Why wasn't it attached to some spring-loaded something-or-other that shoots out of your ass?

GORDON Because that, my friend, would be uncomfortable. 
CUT TO: 
137    EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                               137 
Gordon, lips parched, clothes tattered, peers impatiently over the metal collar as West works on it with some lock picks. West's collar is already off.

WEST Why didn't you tell me you had an 'auxiliary' tool kit? 
GORDON I did tell you, but in your zeal to run and leap off a two-hundred- foot cliff, I don't think you heard me. 
West eats the grilled Gila monster voraciously. And eats. And enjoys it more. And eats. He notices Gordon watching him. 
WEST What?! 
Gordon looks to the heavens and recites. 
GORDON '... Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them, And show the heavens more just.' 
Gordon's quote has gone on.       And on.   And on.   He notices West watching him. 
GORDON What?! 
WEST You know, Gordon, you can be quite annoying -- flaunting that fancy education. 
GORDON Well, truth be told, I never had a fancy education -- not a formal one, anyway. 
WEST (looks at Gordon's ring) The Harvard thing seems pretty formal to me. 
GORDON This ring? This ring isn't real. Do you want it? (MORE)

GORDON (CONT'D) (takes ring off and tosses it into fire) A prop. I'm an actor. Or was. I gave it up. I went by the name of Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me? 
WEST No. How did you wind up in this line of work? 
GORDON The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin -- a light comedy -- at Ford's Theater in Washington. There was this one line I had... always got the biggest laugh in the show. One night, it drowned out the gunshot that killed President Lincoln. (beat) I decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again. 
CLOSE - TARANTULA 
walks slowly across West's outstretched hand. 
GORDON Uh... There's a spider on your hand. Doesn't that bother you? 
WEST She doesn't want any trouble. She's just trying to get warm. 
He puts the spider down into the sand. 
GORDON How come you know so much about the desert, anyway? 
WEST The Indians taught me. I lived out here when I was a boy. 
Gordon starts to ask West something but West doesn't want him to pry further.

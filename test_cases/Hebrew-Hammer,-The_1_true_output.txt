MOHAMMED Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up. 
HAMMER Not if I can help it. You got any information for me? 
MOHAMMED I don't. But I know somebody who does. 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER ROOM 
Mohammed escorts the Hammer through a love beaded doorway into a back room. Inside, JAMAL, a black elf, sits on a sofa. A blunt hangs from his mouth and his arms are wrapped around two GORGEOUS SISTERS. 
MOHAMMED (CONT'D) Jamal, I'd like for you to meet the Hebrew Hammer. 
Jamal pulls his shades down slightly to get a better look. 
JAMAL 'Sup. 
MOHAMMED I'd like for you to tell him what you told me. 
JAMAL A'ight, a'ight, cool. Yo, it's like this. That nigga Santy Claus be trippin'. First that motherfucker kills his own pops, then he start talkin' 'bout bustin a cap in Hanukkah's ass. Next, the racist motherfucker kick my ass out the workshop, sayin' that there ain't no room for no little colored elves like me. Can you believe that shit? Yo, if it wasn't for the arthritis in my joints, you best believe that I'd be... 
Jamal makes the sideways gun holding gesture, and mock pulls the trigger. 
JAMAL (CONT'D) ...blam! blam! blam! Bustin' caps all up in his ass. You know what I'm sayin'? 
HAMMER Is there anything else you can tell me? His hangouts, his next move, anything? 
Jamal thinks for a second. 
JAMAL Well, come to think of it, there is one thing. Before I left, I was packin' up my shit and I overheard the nigga talkin' to some business pahtnah or something. Sayin that he'd meet him today at some joint called Duke's. Round five o'clock if my memory serves. When he got off the phone and jetted, I scoped the room for some jewelry, cash, whatevers. You know, a severance package. Didn't find any duckets, but I did snatch this. 
Jamal pulls out a matchbbok from his pocket. The front cover reads, "DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN." He hands it to the Hammer. 
HAMMER Thanks little brother, you've been a big help. 
JAMAL Shit fool, ain't no thang. If it wasn't for my real brothers here at the K.L.F., I'd be shining shoes at the train station or getting my afro tossed up against a velcro wall in some redneck bar somewhere. I finally gots a place where I belong. Fuck Christmas. I'm all about smoking blunts and pimpin' bitches. I'm all about Kwanzaa nigga! 
Mohammed and the Hammer head towards the door. 
MOHAMMED He's new. He's still got a long way to go before he understands the true meaning of Kwanzaa. 
HAMMER Thanks again Mo, you always deliver the goods. 
MOHAMMED You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail... 
HAMMER Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is. 
MOHAMMED It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother. 
Mohammed pounds his fist against his chest and then raises it. The Hammer returns the gesture. 
HAMMER Alekem Salam. 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - AFTERNOON 
The Hammer's Caddy drives past a sneaky looking SALVATION NAVY GUY. We do your standard BLAXPLOITATION ZOOM into him as he begins to speak into the lapel of his uniform. 
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Santa holds a walkie-talkie in hand and we the hear the voice of the Salvation Navy Guy. Although behind him hangs a banner reading, "SANTA'S WORKSHOP," the interior is a run down sweatshop. 
SALVATION NAVY GUY (O.S.) It's me. He's on his way. 
SANTA Excellent. Everything is going as planned. 
Santa puts the walkie-talkie down, and addresses somebody O.S.

Tolstoy nods. 
TOLSTOY I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down. 
Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit. 
TOLSTOY You know, I was born on this sofa... 
Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa. 
TOLSTOY Sit. Sit. 
Valentin sits down. 
TOLSTOY Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here. (beat) Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing? 
Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep. 
TOLSTOY My boy, what is it? (beat) I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa. 
Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears. 
VALENTIN I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work. 
Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa. 
TOLSTOY You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together. 
He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his fortune.

28   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           28 
Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table. 
SOFYA These people have nothing. 
DUSHAN It really is the most extraordinary thing. 
Absolutely ignoring him. 
SOFYA It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much. 
TOLSTOY I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away. 
ANDREY Give it to whom? 
SOFYA It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior. 
TOLSTOY I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do. 
A pause.   Valentin fills the silence. 
VALENTIN It's a keystone of the movement. 
SOFYA Oh, I know all about the movement. 
A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care. 
TOLSTOY If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month. 
SOFYA No, they'd spend it on drink and whores. 
TOLSTOY Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot? 
Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan. 
DUSHAN Oh, that's good...that's good. 
Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table. Sofya flushes with anger. 
VALENTIN I think...(sneeze)

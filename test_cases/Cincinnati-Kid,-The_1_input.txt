He stands up but doesn't move toward her. 
KID Sure you are. You're The Shooter's woman. 
MELBA Right. And maybe I'll go on being The Shooter's Woman, even after you and I have had our little romp. What do you think about that? 
KID First place, Old Shooter'll come barging through that door any minute. He said they were winding it up. 
MELBA No barging. He doesn't have his key with him. (stands up) Have to buzz from downstairs. (moves toward him provocatively) So we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come. 
The Kid stays where he is as she comes up against him. 
KID Also it don't mean anything to you, you're Christian's friend? 
MELBA Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus. You know that. (her arms around him) I have a shaky sense of security, Kid. Don't make me feel unwanted. 
He kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while, then pulls away. 
MELBA No good? 
KID You know damn well how good it was. Where's a pack of cards? 
MELBA What do we need cards for? 
KID Gin or casino, you name it. All I know is we're switching to another indoor sport. 
INT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL 
The poker game is over. Two of the Wealthy Types have already departed; one is finishing a drink on the way out; another is putting his winnings into his wallet; a third is writing out a check. Lancey and The Shooter still sit at the table in f.g. 
SHOOTER Lady Fingers'll want to come, I bet, and she's right on the edge of her stake. She could spell me dealing. 
LANCEY Sure, sure. Haven't seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years. 
SHOOTER Well, that's it, then. Monday night, Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel. And may the best man win. 
LANCEY Yes, that's how it usually comes out in the long run. You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter? 
SHOOTER Yeah, he's going to give you trouble. 
LANCEY I don't want it to be one of those marathon games. Not any more. 
SHOOTER Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly's in Omaha. Remember? 
LANCEY Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played though, I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush. At Soapy Smith's in Skagway. Four nights and three days. 
SHOOTER You win? 
LANCEY Depends how you look at it. When we wound up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn't get through to Dawson City till the following June. Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush. 
SHOOTER You been around a long time. 
LANCEY That is undeniably true. But it doesn't mean I'm ready to retire. How old is this boy of yours? 
SHOOTER Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like that. 
LANCEY Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better, knowing that. I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude. This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years. 
INT. CORRIDOR, PLUSH HOTEL - FELIX 
He is standing by an elevator in f.g. keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game. FELIX is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet, deferential manner. When he sees a door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight as the latter comes toward him. It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known. 
FELIX Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you. 
The doors of the elevator open. Felix yields precedence to The Shooter and they enter it. The doors close. 
INT. LOBBY, PLUSH HOTEL - AT THE ELEVATORS 
An elevator opens, and The Shooter and Felix come out. 
SHOOTER I ought to call my woman. 
FELIX Yes, of course. They always like to know it if you're going to be late for supper. 
CAMERA MOVES with them as The Shooter leads the way to a row of telephone booths and enters one. 
INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID 
They are sitting at the table in a game of casino. She plays an ace from her hand, adds a seven from the board, and lays them both on top of a three-card pile. 
MELBA Still building eights.

{"test1_input": "NANA That man is obsessed with my ass. \nZOE I know.   It's kind of upsetting. \nNANA He wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot. But, I don't know. What's the hurry? \nZOE You've been engaged for nine years. \nNANA No reason to rush into anything. \nNana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes. \nNANA (CONT'D) You look terrible, dear. \nZOE Thanks. \nNANA You must really love him, huh? \nZOE I guess I do. \nNANA Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and I'm sure he loves you, too. But, you have put him in a really awkward position. Having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple. And you're not married. And he's not the father. And you've only been together a little while. And now you're having twins. And-- \nZOE Please stop. \nNANA I'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly, I don't think any man is that great. \nThey complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur smiles at them and then \"raises the roof.\" \nNANA (CONT'D) Arthur's just about the best man I know, and look at him. He's a fucking idiot. \nEXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY \nStan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look older. Thinner. \nJoan approaches and stands next to him for a bit. \nJOAN You know, people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm. (MORE) \nJOAN (CONT'D) All of our friends in New York, they thought we'd lost our minds. \nStan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before. \nJOAN (CONT'D) I guess I'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction. You just have to be open to it. \nStan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He shrugs. \nSTAN Having a baby with someone I barely know, someone else's baby...it's just not how I pictured it. \nJOAN I used to work on Wall Street. Now I wear boots covered in goat shit. This isn't how I pictured it, either. But guess what...I'm happy. \nShe gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away. \nINT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT \nStan lies in bed looking up at the \"stars.\" There's even less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over to try and sleep. \nANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room. Stan looks at it and can't help but smile. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears. \nZoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is growing. For the first time, we see a smile. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their usual circle. Lori is passing around a list. \nLORI Make sure you put your numbers down. I want to have everyone's number handy in case I go into labor early. \nZoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly. \nZOE Hi, guys. \nNo one knows what to say. \nCAROL Hi, Zoe. \nZOE I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry I got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and I'm sorry I interrupted you, Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing better. \nTABITHA Thanks. \nZOE (to Carol) And I've thought a lot about what you said, about how lucky I am. I got into this whole situation because I wanted to have a baby. And, somehow, I lost sight of that. (then) Anyway, I need partners in this, and I hope you'll take me back. \nLori smiles and hands her the piece of paper. \n", "test1_true": "LORI It's a phone tree. I'm due next month, but my midwife thinks I may go sooner. I want everyone to be there. Are you in? \nZoe smiles. \nZOE I'm in. \nEXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY \nZoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as far as it will go. \nA WOMAN with a double stroller approaches.   Zoe smiles. \nZOE Hi. \nWOMAN Hi. \nTWIN TODDLERS Hi./Hi. \nZoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar voice. \nSTAN Hi. \nHer P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.     For a brief second, they look like a family. \nZoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or what. They just stand there. \nZOE Hi. \nSTAN Hi. \nZOE You said that already. \nSTAN You...look great. \nZoe touches her belly.    Proud but protective. \nSTAN (CONT'D) How are you feeling? \nZOE Okay. \nSTAN Good. \nA long silence. \nZOE You have a beard. \nSTAN Yeah, it's awful isn't it. \nZOE No. \nSTAN Don't lie. (then) Did I tell you how pretty you look? \nZoe nods.   Another silence. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I miss you. \nA group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This separation makes the moment all the more tense. \nZOE I miss you, too. \nSTAN This whole time we've been apart, I've been trying to figure out what it is about you that I love so much. And I think that it's that a lot of people talk about doing things, but you actually do them. You're really kind of daring. How you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog. You came and found me at the Farmer's Market even though the night before I acted like a total stalker... \nZoe smiles at the memory.      Stan continues. \nSTAN (CONT'D) And now you're pregnant. Because you wanted to have a baby and didn't think you could wait any longer. Well, that's just the same kind of thing. It's...brave. And I can't love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason. \nStan takes her hands. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I love you. I've been waiting my whole life for you. And I can't let one little baby get in the way of that. I just...can't. \nZOE There's something I need to tell you. \nSTAN Okay. \nZOE It's big. And you're allowed to take all of this back when I tell you. \nSTAN What. \nZOE It's not just one baby....I'm having twins. \nStan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one. \nAnd then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just so ridiculous. \n", "test1_id": 1401, "test2_input": "Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up. \nDR. HARRIS Now's the time I start discussing a birthing plan with my patients. Do you want me to wait until next time when Stan's here? \nZOE Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here. \nDR. HARRIS He's out of town or something? \nZOE No.    He's just...out. \nDR. HARRIS Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that. \nZOE It's back to just you and me now. We've come full circle. \nDR. HARRIS Well, don't you want anyone with you in the delivery room? You know, like a birthing partner? \nINT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY \nZoe and Nana are speed-walking.    Nana stops, excited. \nNANA Me? \nZOE Yeah.   Is that okay? \nNANA Of course. \nZOE Good.   `Cause you're all I've got. \nNANA What do I have to do? \nZOE I don't know. It will be a c-section, so, basically, just stand there and try not to faint. \nNANA I can do that. \nZOE Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me that you'll be there. \nNANA Are you kidding me? I've been waiting my whole life for this. \nThey pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and eyes closed. \nZOE Holy shit, is he dead? \nNANA Sleeping. \nZOE How can you tell? \nNANA He's been like that all morning.    I wore him out last night. \nZOE Wow.   I did not need to know that. \nNANA We were celebrating. (with a smile) We finally set a date. \nZoe stops dead in her tracks. \nZOE Excuse me? \nINT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY \nNana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room. \nNANA So, we'll put the band here and the dance floor right here. \nZOE I can't believe you're getting married. What made you change your mind? \nNANA All of a sudden it just hit me, what am I waiting for? I love him. He loves me. What am I so afraid of? \nZOE Wow.   This is...really big news. \nNANA You don't seem happy. \nZOE No, I am. It's just...it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic. You're getting married and here I am... \nHer voice trails off. \nNANA Zoe. \nZOE Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really happy for you. \nNANA I'm worried about you, honey. \nZOE I'm fine. \nNANA I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I made. I've been alone for over thirty years now, and that's too long. Sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on. \nZOE Are you talking about my father or Stan? \n", "test2_true": "INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe has her box of photographs.   She pulls out a picture from the very bottom. \nNANA (V.O.) Because if you don't learn how to forgive, you will always be stuck in the past. \nThe photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like her, that it can only be her father. \nAfter a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other. \nOver this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nThe music takes us into the church and there we find Nana, lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the sweetest kiss. \nANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a handkerchief back and forth. \nINT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER \nBobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition of \"What a Wonderful World.\" \nNana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor.   It's their first dance as husband and wife. \nBOBBY (singing) I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you... \nZoe watches, her hands on her belly.   Mona stands beside her. \nMONA This song always makes me cry. \nZOE Me, too. \nMONA Is it happy or sad? The words are happy but the song is so sad. \nZOE I guess it's both.   Happy and sad. \nBOBBY (singing) I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark and sacred night... \nMONA I'm sorry about the things I said. \nZOE I know. \nMONA It was really shitty of me. \nZOE It was. Especially because you were right. \nMona takes Zoe's hand. \nBOBBY (singing) And I think to myself...what a wonderful world... \nZOE I don't want to be alone forever, Mona. \nMONA Then don't be. \nEXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY \nStan stares off into space. His beard is back.   A CUSTOMER surveys the different cheeses on the table. \nCUSTOMER Is this new? The Zoe? \nSTAN Yeah. This is the first week it's been out. \nCUSTOMER Can I have a sample?     What's it like? \nSTAN It's...very stubborn, overly suspicious and distrustful of men. \nThe customer looks up at Stan. \nCUSTOMER Huh? \nINT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER \nBobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor. \nBOBBY Come on, you old maid. \nZOE No. \nBOBBY Dance with me. One dance. \nZOE Forget it. \nBOBBY Fine. But it doesn't mean that I won't dance with you. \n", "test2_id": 1402, "test3_input": "ZOE What? \nBobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his ass triple-time, like Beyonce. \nBOBBY Haaaaaay. \nZOE Go away, you freak. \nA crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping, thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine. \nBOBBY Smack it, Bitch. \nBobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) You know you love it. Uh-huh. That's right. Smack it. \nThe old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples smacking each other's asses. \nWhile this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face. \nBobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) What the hell? \nAn OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle. \nOLD MAN Damn it. Not again. (then, checks pants) Nope. Not me. \nA few other old people look down and check themselves.   At which point, Zoe looks down and realizes. \nZOE I think my water just broke. \nEXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY \nThe whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the logistics of the trip to the hospital. \nZOE I'll drive. \nNANA You're in labor.   You can't drive. \nARTHUR I'll drive. \nNANA You don't have a car or a license. (then, to Bobby) You drive. \nBOBBY We're in Queens. I don't even know what side of the road they drive on here. \nZOE Will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital? \nAll of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the wheel. She leans out and waves. \nMONA This was my surprise for after the wedding, but let's hit it. \nBOBBY This works. \nThey all pile in. \nAnd then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST MARRIED...FINALLY! \"Ensure\" cans tied to strings bump along behind them. \nINT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER \nThings are a bit frantic in the car. \nNANA Are you okay? Remember to breathe. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in. \nMona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths. \nMONA Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee. \nNANA (joining in) Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee... \nMONA/NANA Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee... \nZOE Please stop. It's getting really breathy in here. I'm fine. \nBOBBY What about me? I have amniotic fluid on my Gucci tux. \nANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked. \nARTHUR Who needs a drink? \nEveryone (including Zoe) raises their hands. \nINT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY \nZoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana grabs the glass and swigs it. \n", "test3_true": "BOBBY What? \nNANA I don't know if I can do this. \nBOBBY What?! \nNANA I can't go in with her. \nBOBBY Well, I certainly can't do it.   I don't do vaginas. \nThey look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his walker. \nARTHUR Don't look at me. \nNana starts to hyperventilate. \nNANA Help me, Bobby. \nBOBBY Nana, pull yourself together. This is the biggest moment of Zoe's life, and you can't let her down. I'd slap you right now, but I'm afraid your teeth would fly out. \nINT. LABOR AND DELIVERY ROOM - DAY \nZoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown. \nZOE Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee. \nBobby enters, all sweetness and light. \nBOBBY Hey, girl.     How ya doing? \nZOE Okay. \nBOBBY Good. (smiles, then) So, I really don't want you to worry, but Nana just passed out at the nurse's station and is now down in the ER getting stitches. \nZOE What??? \nBOBBY Everything's under control. Good thing we're at the hospital, right? \nZoe jumps out of bed. \nZOE Where is she? \nBOBBY Get back in bed. All is well. Arthur's with her. Now, on to bigger and better...who do you want to be your birthing partner? Your choices are me or Mona. \nZoe starts to cry. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) I know. They're shitty choices. Do you want me to call your scary lesbian friends from your group? \nZOE I don't know. \nBOBBY We're going to get through this, okay? You just have to really think about it. Who do you want with you in the delivery room? \nZoe wipes her tears. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Who is the one person you want by your side? \nEXT. 77TH STREET - DAY \nZoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital gown. \nZOE Taxi! \nINT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe jumps in.   The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror \nCABBIE You're not an escaped mental patient, are you? \nZOE Kind of. \nEXT. 14TH STREET - DAY \nZoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero. \nAnd suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady herself. \nZOE Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts. \nOLIVIA Are you okay? \nOut of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees Olivia. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) Are you in labor? \n", "test3_id": 1403}

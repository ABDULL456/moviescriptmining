{"train": "THE BACK-UP PLAN \nWritten by \nKate Angelo \nAugust 30th, 2007 \nINT. EXAM ROOM - DAY \nWe're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish. \nZOE (V.O.) I can't believe I didn't get a pedicure for this. How embarrassing. Look at that... \nThe toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide. \nZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D) What's wrong with me? If I were with a real guy doing this, I would've gotten a pedicure. And a wax. I'm pathetic. \nThe CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped. \nZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fuck, that one's even worse. And when did my toes get so fat? No wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed animal. \nZoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now. \nZOE (CONT'D) Sorry I didn't get a pedicure. \nDR. HARRIS What? \nDR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes. \nZOE My toes...sorry. \nDR. HARRIS I'm not looking at your toes. \nZOE Right.   Duh. \nDr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves. \nDR. HARRIS All done. \nZOE That's it? \nAnd now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something, girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend. \nDR. HARRIS I'll elevate your legs for ten minutes and then you're good to go. \nHe sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer. \nZOE This is the first time I've heard that ticking clock sound and it doesn't freak me out. \nDR. HARRIS Good.   Just relax. \nZOE I can't, I'm totally freaking out. \nDR. HARRIS Everything's going to be great. I have a feeling you and... (checks empty syringe) Number CRM-101404 are going to make beautiful babies together. \nZoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right. \nBOBBY (V.O.) Number CRM-101404? Are you high? \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nTITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO \nBOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file and points to a piece of paper. \nBOBBY Says here he has red hair and freckles. \nZOE And glasses, too. \nBOBBY And why are we picking him? \nZOE Because he's honest. \nBOBBY He's ugly. \nZoe points to a stack of potential donors. \nZOE You think they're all telling the truth? If they're so smart and good looking, why are they beating off into a cup? \nBOBBY Have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles? \nZOE No, and I won't have to. \nBOBBY But what about your kid? No one's going to want to fuck your kid. (beat) That came out wrong. \nDR. HARRIS You don't have to walk like that. \nZOE Oh.   Okay. \nZoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them. \nZOE (CONT'D) Should we hug? We might have just made a baby together. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this exclusive baby club. \nZOE Hi. \nPREGNANT WOMEN Hi. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nZoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club... \nZOE Hi. \nWOMAN Hi. \nThe elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) You're starting to freak me out. \nZOE Sorry. \nZoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look. \nWOMAN Stop it. \nEXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY \nIt's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over their heads. \nDespite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together. \nA WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by. \nZOE Hi! \nZoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She rounds the corner towards the subway station and then, miraculously, spies a cab. \nZOE (CONT'D) Taxi! \nShe runs (little steps) across the street. \nINT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe closes the door behind her. \nZOE Hallelujah! \nAs soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices someone entering the cab from the other side. \nThis is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid -- faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair. \nZOE (CONT'D) Uh...excuse me. This is my cab. \nSTAN You own it? \nZOE No, but I'm about to rent it. \nSTAN Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it. \nZOE I don't think so. \nSTAN If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours. \nZOE I didn't see you. \nSTAN I saw you see me. \nZOE (to the cabbie) Sir, who saw you first? \nThe CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read. \nSTAN Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code. It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we-- \nZOE Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out. \nZoe grabs the door handle and then turns back. \nBOBBY I tried to talk her out of it. \nJALISA Why'd you do that, Mami? \nBOBBY (to Jalisa) I know, right? \nJALISA Red pubes.     Eek... \nZOE I'm never going to see his pubes! \nBOBBY You'll see your kid's pubes. \nZOE I doubt it. \nBOBBY But you'll know they're there. \nZOE What is wrong with you? \nJALISA So, what happened?    Come on... \nZOE I lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over. I barely felt a thing. \nBOBBY Sounds like Ricardo. \nJALISA Tell me about it, Papi. \nBobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe. \nBOBBY So...what happens now? \nZOE Now, we wait. \nBOBBY That's no fun, I want to know if I'm going to be a fairy godmother. \nZOE We'll just have to wait and see. \nZoe smiles and heads for the back. \nEXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT \nThe lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe, Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit. \nBOBBY Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can have an O'Dhouls or something. \nJALISA We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base. \nBOBBY Forget it, she's not coming. I can tell by the dull look on her face. \nZOE Love you. \nThey all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm, singing. \nBOBBY/JALISA I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign... \nZoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears from the shadows. \nSTAN Hi. \nZOE Aahhh! \nZoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over. \nZOE (CONT'D) You scared the hell out of me! \nSTAN Oh, wow.   Is he...okay? \nNuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets him upright. \nZOE What are you doing here? \nSTAN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Or hurt your dog. Don't worry, I'm not a stalker. \nZOE How'd you know I worked here? \nSTAN I followed you after the subway. (thinks, then) That sounds a little stalkery, huh? \nZOE Yeah. \nSTAN I just really wanted to see you again. Almost like I had to see you again. Can I walk you home? (then) Is it me or does everything I say make me sound more like a stalker? \nZoe allows a small smile. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Can I just give you my card? Here. Take my card. I'm not a freak. Really. I sell cheese. \nThis hangs out there for a beat. \nMONA Sure I am. \nZOE You just told me that if I breast- feed \"my girls\" will end up looking like empty tube socks. \nMONA I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder. \nZOE What does it do to your bladder? \nMona cracks up and then stops abruptly. \nMONA I just peed a little bit. \nZOE I don't think I'm pregnant. The doctor says it will probably take several tries. Something about frozen sperm being lazy. \nMONA Good.   Take your time. \nZoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window. \nZOE So, should I call this guy?   Do you think that would be weird? \nMONA Do I think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable? No. Because that's what you do. You sabotage. \nZOE (ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market. And it's right around the corner. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? \nMONA I look fat and old? \nZOE No. \nMONA Then, no. \nZOE Let's go spy on him. Come on. It will be fun. Like high school. \nMONA I can't. (checks watch) This twenty minute breakfast concludes my \"me\" time for the week. More proof that you should not have kids. \nEXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY \nThe Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby. \nZoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck. \nZOE Oh, well. \nShe walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, \"The Organics.\" The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around. \nAs she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band. He's playing banjo. \nZoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches. \nOLIVIA Can I help you? \nZOE (distracted) No, I'm fine. \nZoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan. \nOLIVIA Tasty, huh? \nZoe nods and takes another berry. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right? \nZoe now turns, confused. \nZOE What? \nOLIVIA And don't look now, but he's coming this way. \nOlivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder. \nSTAN A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all. \nZOE (trying to be casual) I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie. \nSTAN I love blueberry pie. \nStan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe. \nZOE I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something. \nSTAN What makes you think I don't? \nZOE I don't know, you're over there playing the banjo. \nSTAN Can't someone do both? \nZOE Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either. \nZOE (CONT'D) Come on, come on, come on... \nWe hear the doorbell RING. \nZOE (CONT'D) Shit. \nZoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again. \nZOE (CONT'D) Shit! \nA faint PLUS SIGN is forming. \nZOE (CONT'D) Shitshitshitshit... \nThe plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops. There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant. \nZOE (CONT'D) No, shit. \nZoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then... \nZOE (CONT'D) Holy fucking shit! \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nManhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window. \nSTAN Are you feeling okay? \nZoe nods.   Her face looks pale. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Good, because this should really be a culinary adventure. This is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment, depending on the chef. \nZoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls the window all the way down and hangs her head out. \nSTAN (CONT'D) And some of the guys from the band will be there. So, we might get a little jam going. Sounds fun, right? (then) Zoe? \nZoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like a bad dream. \nINT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of sweat on her forehead. \nSTAN And this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta. \nHe takes some for each of them. \nSTAN (CONT'D) And this, oh this must be white beans and lamb's tongue. You've got to have some of this. Etienne is famous for his lamb's tongue. \nOlivia approaches. \nOLIVIA Hey, stranger. \nSTAN Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe. \nOLIVIA Right. How'd that blueberry pie turn out? \nZOE What? \nOLIVIA You bought blueberries from me? Said you were going to make a pie? \nZOE Um, can you excuse me for a second? \nZoe hurries off.   Olivia watches her go.   Eyes narrowing. \nOLIVIA No way she knows how to bake a pie. \nINT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone. \nZOE I'm pregnant. \nBOBBY (O.S.) What?!   Where are you? I'm on my way. \nZOE Brooklyn. \nBOBBY (O.S.) Where's that? \nZoe hangs up the phone. \nINT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe is now on the phone with Mona. \nMONA (O.S.) Don't panic. Could be a false positive. Take another test. \nZoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done, she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head. \nZOE Ohhhhhhhh. \nShe spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet, mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her eyes. \nZOE (CONT'D) Please, God... \nBut she can't pee.   She tries and tries. \nZOE (CONT'D) Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to... \nShe doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's done, she holds up the test. \nCU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN. \nZOE (CONT'D) Fuck me. \nEXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT \nStan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along. \nSTAN My singing made you vomit. \nZOE No.    It's not that. \nSTAN Sure, we were a little out of tune, but... \nZOE I really don't feel well. \nSTAN Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk? \nANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching. Zoe's face pales. \nCAROL Zoe? \nZOE Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there... \nCAROL Where have you been?    You haven't been coming to any-- \nZOE (cutting her off) Right. I know. I've been so busy. Next one, I'm there. For sure. (then, awkward) This is my friend, Stan. \nSTAN Hi. \nCAROL (eyeing Stan suspiciously) Hello. Are you two-- \nZOE Late. Yes. We are. We really are. (pushing Stan along) I'll see you at the meeting. Bye. \nThey walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe. \nSTAN An old...boyfriend? \nZOE Her name is Carol. We're on a...committee together. \nThey reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder to make sure Carol's gone. \nZOE (CONT'D) All right. I have to go to bed now. I'll call you, okay? \nSTAN Okay. (then) Hey, I was thinking, if you don't have any plans this weekend, maybe you'd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days. \nZOE I'll call you tomorrow. Something's not agreeing with me. \nSTAN Was it the lamb's tongue? \nZoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands there for a beat. He calls after her. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Okay, well...this weekend.   Think about it. \nINT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nZoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear. \nZOE What the hell have I done? \nEXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY \nEstablishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens. \nINT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY \nThe lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada. \nZoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up. \nANNIE Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic. \nShe quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite. \nZOE (CONT'D) Oh.   My.    God. \nStew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one. \nNuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop. \nAnd now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows is she's supposed to be open-minded. \nJOAN Would you like a plate? \nZoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing. \nJOAN (CONT'D) A napkin? \nZoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite. \nJOAN (CONT'D) I'm Joan. \nZoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite. \nJOAN (CONT'D) And you must be Zoe. \nZoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back. \nINT. DINING ROOM - LATER \nThe dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable. \nEDWARD The stew is delicious, honey. \nSTAN Yeah, Mom, it's awesome. \nEDWARD (to Zoe) Have you ever in your life had stew like this? Come on, be honest. \nZoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret. \nZOE Uh...no.    Never. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThey are having coffee and dessert in the living room. Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her. \nJOAN So are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled? \nZOE Oh, you can say paralyzed. He doesn't mind. (then) No, our pets are all in great shape. Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills. \nJOAN Those puppy mills are terrible.    I read about them in the paper. \nZOE Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair. \nEDWARD You should have sued that place. \nZOE I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better. \nSTAN You worked for Google? \nZoe nods. \nSTAN (CONT'D) How could I not know that? \nZOE You never asked. \nSTAN And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store? \nStan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I love that. \nZOE It's been fun. Beats brand management, that's for sure. \nJOAN (to Edward) That sounds like us, honey. \nEDWARD It's true. (to Zoe) When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. And now, twenty years later, here we are... \nJOAN Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. Make things happen your own way, you know? \nZoe forces a smile.   If only they knew. \nEXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT \nThe moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan walk the grounds of the farm. \nNuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels. \nINT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her. \nZOE (under her breath) You're such a douchebag. \nSTAN What? \nZoe shakes her head and then melts into him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER \nThey are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They look happy and worn out \nTheir P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left. \nStan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the \"stars\"... \nSTAN That was amazing. I mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing. \nZoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath. \nZOE Stan. \nSTAN Yeah. \nZOE There's something I really have to tell you. \nSTAN There's something I have to tell you, too. \nNow Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Can I go first? `Cause if we're going to say the same thing, I want to say it first. \nZOE We're not going to say the same thing. \nSTAN Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and I just have to say it. \nZOE Okay. \nSTAN I've dated a lot of women. I mean, not tons, but a lot. And, the thing is, I've never...been in love before. I've never even told anyone I love them before. Because I just never felt it. But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, I feel this, this... (he shakes his head) Maybe this is too much to say right now, but...I love you, Zoe. I really do. \nStan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares at him. \nSTAN (CONT'D) In my mind, you were supposed to say, I love you, too. \nInstead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A beat later, we hear her vomit. \nINT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan enters. \nSTAN Zoe? \nHe looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Why are you crying? Everything's perfect. \nZOE It's not. \nSTAN Sure it is. \nZoe takes a deep breath. \nSTAN (CONT'D) What? \nZOE I'm pregnant. \nSTAN Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast. \nZoe shakes her head. \nZOE I just found out. \nSTAN Pregnant? As in you're going to have a baby? \nZoe nods. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I don't understand. \nZOE I know.   It's hard to explain. \nSTAN Well, who's it? \nJOAN (CONT'D) And pretty and... \nAnother HURL.    Joan looks at Stan. \nJOAN (CONT'D) What the hell's going on in there? \nSTAN She's pregnant. \nJOAN Oh, dear God. \nWe hear the toilet FLUSH. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nZoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition. Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet. \nZOE I don't know what to say. \nNeither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back and forth in the gravel. \nZOE (CONT'D) I guess I'd given up on meeting someone like you, and I did what I thought was best. \nStan still doesn't say anything. \nZOE (CONT'D) But, for what it's worth...I love you, too. \nShe puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go. His hands in his pockets. \nEXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nZoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms. \nMONA Come here. \nZoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual. \nShe pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For the first time, we actually see a little bump. \nINT. EXAM ROOM - DAY \nZoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure. \nDr. Harris comes in with a big smile. \nDR. HARRIS Congratulations! What luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh? And with frozen sperm, too. So, how are we feeling? \nZOE (unconvincing) Okay. \nDR. HARRIS You sure about that? \nZOE It's been hard. I don't know if I was really prepared for this. \nDR. HARRIS Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult. \nDr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see. \nDR. HARRIS (CONT'D) Well, the good news is everything looks great. You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today. \nOn the screen we see a small flickering dot.    Dr. Harris smiles. \nZOE That's it?     That's...my baby? \nSaying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe. Tears fill her eyes. \nZOE (CONT'D) Hi, Baby. (then) Is it okay? Is it healthy? \nDR. HARRIS Everything's just... (makes a face, then) Wait, a minute... \nZOE What?   Wait a minute, what? \nDR. HARRIS Well...I see another heartbeat. \nZOE (freaking out) It has two hearts? \nDR. HARRIS No...but you have two babies. \nZoe's mouth falls open. \nNT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nWe're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her head in her hands. \nNANA That man is obsessed with my ass. \nZOE I know.   It's kind of upsetting. \nNANA He wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot. But, I don't know. What's the hurry? \nZOE You've been engaged for nine years. \nNANA No reason to rush into anything. \nNana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes. \nNANA (CONT'D) You look terrible, dear. \nZOE Thanks. \nNANA You must really love him, huh? \nZOE I guess I do. \nNANA Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and I'm sure he loves you, too. But, you have put him in a really awkward position. Having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple. And you're not married. And he's not the father. And you've only been together a little while. And now you're having twins. And-- \nZOE Please stop. \nNANA I'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly, I don't think any man is that great. \nThey complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur smiles at them and then \"raises the roof.\" \nNANA (CONT'D) Arthur's just about the best man I know, and look at him. He's a fucking idiot. \nEXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY \nStan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look older. Thinner. \nJoan approaches and stands next to him for a bit. \nJOAN You know, people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm. (MORE) \nJOAN (CONT'D) All of our friends in New York, they thought we'd lost our minds. \nStan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before. \nJOAN (CONT'D) I guess I'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction. You just have to be open to it. \nStan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He shrugs. \nSTAN Having a baby with someone I barely know, someone else's baby...it's just not how I pictured it. \nJOAN I used to work on Wall Street. Now I wear boots covered in goat shit. This isn't how I pictured it, either. But guess what...I'm happy. \nShe gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away. \nINT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT \nStan lies in bed looking up at the \"stars.\" There's even less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over to try and sleep. \nANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room. Stan looks at it and can't help but smile. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears. \nZoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is growing. For the first time, we see a smile. \nINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their usual circle. Lori is passing around a list. \nLORI Make sure you put your numbers down. I want to have everyone's number handy in case I go into labor early. \nZoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly. \nZOE Hi, guys. \nNo one knows what to say. \nCAROL Hi, Zoe. \nZOE I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry I got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and I'm sorry I interrupted you, Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing better. \nTABITHA Thanks. \nZOE (to Carol) And I've thought a lot about what you said, about how lucky I am. I got into this whole situation because I wanted to have a baby. And, somehow, I lost sight of that. (then) Anyway, I need partners in this, and I hope you'll take me back. \nLori smiles and hands her the piece of paper. \nStan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top. \nSTAN (CONT'D) That's perfect. You look hot. \nZOE Really?    You think? \nZoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper are ten inches apart. \nSTAN Do you have a shawl or something? \nZoe bursts into tears. \nEXT. PERRY STREET - LATER \nA cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great. \nSTAN You look smokin'. \nZOE Thanks, honey. \nZoe pauses in front of the open taxi door. \nSTAN Let's go.     We're super late. \nShe tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight. Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around, but again, the dress is too tight. \nZOE Hmmmm... \nSTAN Why don't you sort of go in...head first and then turn around. \nZoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh. \nZOE Shut up and push me. \nSTAN Push you? \nZOE Just do it. \nStan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab. \nINT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS \nZoe lies down straight across the seats like a board. \nZOE I hate everyone. \nShe sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into tears again. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER \nWe PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly, and The National Enquirer. \nZoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling. \nZOE Do you think he's telling everyone why I didn't go? I'm too much of a fat-ass walrus to go to the wedding? \nBOBBY You're not a fat ass walrus. You're pregnant. \nZoe eyes well up with tears again. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Why are you crying? So what?   You missed a stupid wedding. (MORE) \nBOBBY (CONT'D) You got to have girls' night with me. This is way more fun. \nZOE I don't know. I'm just so emotional lately. It's the hormones. \nBOBBY You can't help it. Being pregnant sucks. You're emotional, and irrational, and you get back fat. \nZOE I have back fat? \nBOBBY No.  I'm just kidding. (then) Okay, yes. You have back fat. \nZoe feels her back. \nZOE How's Stan going to stay with me through this? I'm disgusting. \nBOBBY We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll get some hip maternity clothes... whatever that means. \nZOE Look at me, Bobby. \nBOBBY What? \nZOE (pinching back fat) Look at me. What do you see? \nBOBBY I see the most amazingly wonderful person I know. \nSTAN It's a nice ass. \nZOE You said you don't know the real me, so I thought I'd show you. \nShe picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and acne. \nZOE (CONT'D) This is me in seventh grade. \nStan props himself up in one elbow. \nSTAN Wow. \nZOE I know. \nSTAN You look like Anthony Michael Hall. \nZOE This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character. (then) It also taught me that I should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again. \nShe picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana. \nZOE (CONT'D) This   is one of my favorites because look   how happy I am. I don't even know   what place yellow is, but I'm sure   it's not good. \nSTAN Fifth place. \nZOE But I still look super happy, right? That's all because of Nana. Whatever I did, she thought it was the best. \nThe next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe. Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in regular clothes. \nZOE (CONT'D) These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona. Mona and I met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away. \nSTAN Why are you dressed like that? \nZOE Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way. \nZoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign. \nZOE (CONT'D) This is my mom. \nStan takes the picture and studies it. \nSTAN You look just like her. \nZOE This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died. \nSTAN I...can't imagine. \nZOE She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep. \nZoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock. \nSTAN Do you have any pictures of your dad? \nZoe doesn't say anything. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it... \nZOE My mother was in a coma for two years before the end. That's when my dad left her. \nSTAN Oh. \nZOE So...that's when he died.    To us, anyway. \nSTAN God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry. \nZOE (after a beat) It's okay. It was an important lesson. That's when I realized that nothing lasts forever. \nThis sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments. \nZOE (CONT'D) So, that's my story. That's the real me. \nSTAN Things can last forever, you know. \nZOE Not for me they can't. \nStan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING. \nZOE (CONT'D) That's weird. \nINT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT \nZoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca. \nSTAN I'm confused. Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place? \nZOE I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to get back in their good graces. Go home. I'll meet you there. I don't want them to see you anyway. \nCarol starts banging the drum again and moves off. \nSTAN What's a water birth? \nZOE I don't know. But just so we're clear, this... (re. the whole scene) Is not the real me. \nSTAN I'll wait here. \nZoe grabs another brownie and exits. \nINT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who is now naked and pushing. \nZoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol is beside her, playing the drum and chanting. \nCAROL Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. \nZOE (eyes wide) Wow. Wow. Wow. \nCAROL I know. It's amazing how the body can open up like that. \nZoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw up. She stumbles for the door. \nZOE I'm just going to get some air. I'm feeling a little... \nLORI Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal point. \nLori then GRUNTS through another big contraction. \nMIDWIFE Push, Lori. Push. \nWhile Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol chases after, still beating the drum. \nCAROL You can't leave.   You're her focal point. \nZOE Can't she use someone else? \nCAROL She's in labor. You want to argue with her now? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nCarol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant. \nCAROL Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. \nLori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth. \nZOE Oh, Jesus. (then) What is...that? \nCAROL Sssshh. It's perfectly natural. Sometimes the bowels just let go. (then, back to chanting) Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. \nThe midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie. \nLORI (yelling) Don't move, Zoe, I need you! You're my focal point. \nZOE What does that even mean? \nZoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out another WAIL. \nLORI I need to turn over.    Please! \nJESSIE Do it, Lori. We're here for you. We're all here for you. \nCarol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN. \nCAROL (excited) Here comes the head. \nLori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY. \nJESSIE We can see the head, Lori. \nCAROL There's so much hair! \nZOE (woozy, afraid) I don't think that's the baby's hair. \nLORI I want to see the head. Get me a mirror. It's in the bedroom. \nZOE I'll get it. \nZoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room. \nLORI GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!! \nANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe. \nOLIVIA Oh, hi. \nSTAN Hi. (awkward beat, then) You remember Zoe. \nOLIVIA Right, hi. \nAnd then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) Wow. (then, to Stan) Wow. \nAt the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. \nZOE What is that supposed to mean? \nOLIVIA It's nothing. \nOlivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) (re. Zoe's pregnant belly) I had no idea it was that serious. \nSTAN I told you it was serious. \nZOE (interrupting) What the hell does, \"sorry about last night\" mean? \nOLIVIA It's stupid. I was drunk and... \nSTAN It was nothing. \nZOE What was nothing? \nOlivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted. \nOLIVIA You're having a baby? I didn't know you'd been together that long. \nSTAN Well, they're not mine...but, yeah, we're having a baby. Two actually. \nOn Zoe's look of shock we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her. \nSTAN Nothing happened. \nZOE Get away from me. \nStan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop. \nSTAN Nothing happened! \nZOE You said, \"they're not mine.\" \nSTAN I didn't mean to say it. \nZOE How could you say that? \nSTAN I don't know. I was flustered. \nZOE Flustered? \nSTAN I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I've been up all night watching Orca give birth! \nZOE (incredulous) \"They're not mine?\" \nSTAN (at a loss ) Well, I mean...technically, they're not. \nThe minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back. Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head. \nZOE You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you? \nSTAN Zoe. \nShe runs to a nearby cab and slams the door. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over and stands beside her. \nINT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY \nZoe and Mona are at their usual table.    Zoe looks like she hasn't slept. \nDr. Harris helps Zoe sit up. \nDR. HARRIS Now's the time I start discussing a birthing plan with my patients. Do you want me to wait until next time when Stan's here? \nZOE Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here. \nDR. HARRIS He's out of town or something? \nZOE No.    He's just...out. \nDR. HARRIS Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that. \nZOE It's back to just you and me now. We've come full circle. \nDR. HARRIS Well, don't you want anyone with you in the delivery room? You know, like a birthing partner? \nINT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY \nZoe and Nana are speed-walking.    Nana stops, excited. \nNANA Me? \nZOE Yeah.   Is that okay? \nNANA Of course. \nZOE Good.   `Cause you're all I've got. \nNANA What do I have to do? \nZOE I don't know. It will be a c-section, so, basically, just stand there and try not to faint. \nNANA I can do that. \nZOE Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me that you'll be there. \nNANA Are you kidding me? I've been waiting my whole life for this. \nThey pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and eyes closed. \nZOE Holy shit, is he dead? \nNANA Sleeping. \nZOE How can you tell? \nNANA He's been like that all morning.    I wore him out last night. \nZOE Wow.   I did not need to know that. \nNANA We were celebrating. (with a smile) We finally set a date. \nZoe stops dead in her tracks. \nZOE Excuse me? \nINT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY \nNana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room. \nNANA So, we'll put the band here and the dance floor right here. \nZOE I can't believe you're getting married. What made you change your mind? \nNANA All of a sudden it just hit me, what am I waiting for? I love him. He loves me. What am I so afraid of? \nZOE Wow.   This is...really big news. \nNANA You don't seem happy. \nZOE No, I am. It's just...it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic. You're getting married and here I am... \nHer voice trails off. \nNANA Zoe. \nZOE Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really happy for you. \nNANA I'm worried about you, honey. \nZOE I'm fine. \nNANA I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I made. I've been alone for over thirty years now, and that's too long. Sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on. \nZOE Are you talking about my father or Stan? \nZOE What? \nBobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his ass triple-time, like Beyonce. \nBOBBY Haaaaaay. \nZOE Go away, you freak. \nA crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping, thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine. \nBOBBY Smack it, Bitch. \nBobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) You know you love it. Uh-huh. That's right. Smack it. \nThe old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples smacking each other's asses. \nWhile this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face. \nBobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) What the hell? \nAn OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle. \nOLD MAN Damn it. Not again. (then, checks pants) Nope. Not me. \nA few other old people look down and check themselves.   At which point, Zoe looks down and realizes. \nZOE I think my water just broke. \nEXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY \nThe whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the logistics of the trip to the hospital. \nZOE I'll drive. \nNANA You're in labor.   You can't drive. \nARTHUR I'll drive. \nNANA You don't have a car or a license. (then, to Bobby) You drive. \nBOBBY We're in Queens. I don't even know what side of the road they drive on here. \nZOE Will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital? \nAll of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the wheel. She leans out and waves. \nMONA This was my surprise for after the wedding, but let's hit it. \nBOBBY This works. \nThey all pile in. \nAnd then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST MARRIED...FINALLY! \"Ensure\" cans tied to strings bump along behind them. \nINT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER \nThings are a bit frantic in the car. \nNANA Are you okay? Remember to breathe. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in. \nMona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths. \nMONA Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee. \nNANA (joining in) Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee... \nMONA/NANA Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee... \nZOE Please stop. It's getting really breathy in here. I'm fine. \nBOBBY What about me? I have amniotic fluid on my Gucci tux. \nANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked. \nARTHUR Who needs a drink? \nEveryone (including Zoe) raises their hands. \nINT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY \nZoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana grabs the glass and swigs it. \nAs soon as the contraction ends... \nZOE Fuck off. \nZoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go. \nEXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER \nZoe runs through the market looking for Stan. \nANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading cheese. \nZOE Stan! \nFred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off. \nFRED Whoa. I've had nightmares that started like this. \nZOE Stan! \nStan turns. \nSTAN Zoe? \nZOE Stan! \nSTAN Are you okay? Don't run! \nZOE I can't help it! \nShe keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her. They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk. \nSTAN Are you all right? \nZOE (panting) Great. I'm great. \nSTAN Why are you in a hospital gown? \nZOE I'm in labor. \nSTAN What?   What the hell are you doing here? \nZOE It's you. \nSTAN What? \nZOE Nana's my birthing partner, but she passed out and needed stitches, and Bobby asked me who I most wanted with me, and...it's you. It's only you. (then) I don't want to be alone anymore. I love you. You don't know how much I love you. \nStan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless. \nZOE (CONT'D) More than anything in the world, I love you. \nSTAN I've been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab. \nZoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction. \nZOE Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab, hee-hee, hoo-hoo. \nThe contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan laughs and throws his arms around her. \nZOE (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. \nSTAN I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just love you. I love you so much. (then) Let's get the hell out of here. \nZOE Yeah. I think I really need to go to the hospital now. \nThey kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other. Stan has tears in his eyes. \nSTAN Let's go have our babies. \nPeople clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help but applaud the big moment. \nINT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY \nSome fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing... \nWe are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not look scared. And she does not look alone. \nWIDEN to reveal Stan by her side. \nAnd we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr. Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one by one. \nWe FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to Zoe and Stan. \nZoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other. They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry. \n", "test1_input": "BOBBY He says to name any restaurant you want to go to. (MORE) \nBOBBY (CONT'D) He'll be there with bells on. (then) He didn't say the \"bells on\" part. I added that. Sounds a little too gay, though, so I take it back. \nEXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT \nZoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date. \nINT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT \nZoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically. \nSTAN We could have gone anywhere. \nZOE Just take a bite.   You'll see. \nSTAN Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu... \nZOE Gray's Papaya.   Cheers. \nShe clinks his dog and then they each take a bite. \nZOE (CONT'D) Good, right? \nStan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big. \nZOE (CONT'D) You've lived here your whole life and never been to Gray's Papaya. What's wrong with you? \nSTAN I actually haven't lived here my whole life. We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm....not died, but actually bought a farm and moved upstate. \nZOE That must have been a nice place to grow up. On a farm. \nSTAN What about your family? \nZOE It's just me and my grandmother. She lives in a retirement community in Queens. (an awkward beat) My parents died when I was young. \nSTAN I'm so sorry. \nThere is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs. \nSTAN (CONT'D) I don't know what to say now.    I've made it all awkward and sad. \nZOE It's okay. (then) My dad was kind of a bad guy, anyway. \nSTAN Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe. \nZOE No, come on, we'll get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again. Let's ask all the awkward, get-to-know- you questions right now. \nSTAN Okay.   Good idea. \nZOE Let's see...are you religious? \nSTAN Nope.   What about you? \nZOE No. \nSTAN Have you ever been married? \nZOE No. \nSTAN Aren't you sick of going to weddings? \nZOE If I have to listen to one more couple write their own vows... \nSTAN I hate when they write their own vows! \nThey clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay together, feeling the charge between them. \nSTAN (CONT'D) What about kids? \nZoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there must now be looking at her. \nZOE What about them? \nSTAN Well, do you want them? \nZOE Yeah.   I want kids. \nShe pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real. She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question. \nZOE (CONT'D) Do you? \nSTAN Yeah.   Absolutely. \nZoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again. \n", "test1_true": "They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm. \nZOE Okay, first kiss... \nSTAN Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She wore a head-gear. What about you? \nZOE Summer camp. I think his name was-- \nStan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment... \nZOE (CONT'D) That was way better. \nSTAN When can I see you again? \nZoe feels her heart jump.    She kisses him again. \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nZoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her.    The sun is shining and they are both waking up. \nShe gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight look of concern on her face. \nINT. EQUINOX - DAY \nZoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all. \nZOE What if I'm pregnant? \nMONA Then you'll get fat and hormonal and I'll say, \"I told you so.\" \nZOE But what if this could go somewhere with Stan? Like, really go somewhere. \nMONA Then it will work out perfectly. \nZOE What do you mean? \nMONA Because just when you really like him, you'll break up because you're pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt. That's your dream. \nZOE (thinks, then) I'm not pregnant. \nShe gets off the machine. \nINT. EQUINOX STEAM ROOM - DAY \nWe are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other WOMEN. \nMONA So, when are you seeing him again? \nZOE Tonight. \nMONA Well, don't have sex with him. That's the last thing we need. You get knocked up and we'll have no idea who the father is. \nA few women look over. \nMONA (CONT'D) And then we'll have to do a paternity test. Is it the cheese farmer or the red-pubed bandit? \nMore women look over. \nZOE I'm not going to have sex with him tonight. It's too soon. (for the women's benefit) I'm not a slut. \nMONA Well, bring condoms, just in case. (thinks, then) And a pregnancy test. \nZOE Very funny. \nMONA I'm not joking. \nAll of the women are now staring at Zoe. \nZOE I'm really not a slut. \nINT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nZoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands. Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her. \nZOE There's no way, right? \nINT. ZOE'S BATHEROOM - NIGHT \nZoe pees on the stick.   Nuts is beside her, watching with his head tilted. \nZOE Stop looking at me like that.   I'm not pregnant. \nZoe finishes peeing and looks at the test.   Nothing yet. \n", "test1_id": 1401, "test2_input": "NANA What about a secretary? \nZOE Some kid named Fred. (then) I like him, Nana. \nNANA Well, if he's the right one, he'll stay. \nZOE Do you really think so? \nNANA Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that would be enough to appease you. \nZOE Should I still visit him for the weekend? Or should I just vanish and hope he forgets I ever existed. \nNANA Don't be silly. Go up there for the weekend. Spend some time with him and see what he's really like. \nZOE Yeah.   You're right. \nNANA You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot. \nZoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag? \nINT. CAR - DAY \nZoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally. \nZOE Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. Could happen, right? \nWIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning. \nZOE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up? \nNuts closes his eyes and lays down. \nZOE (CONT'D) My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open? (yawning) Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why am I so tired? I slept nine hours. (thinks, then) And I'm starving, too. What the hell is going on? \nZoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks. \nINT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY \nZoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face. \nZOE Am I even allowed to drink coffee? \nThe trucker looks at her.    She looks at him. \nZOE (CONT'D) Do you know anything about being pregnant? \nEXT. CAR - LATER \nZoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere. \nINT. CAR - SAME \nZoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is in her lap. \nHer cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the little coffee cup. \nZOE Thanks a lot, decaf. \nShe picks up the phone. \nSTAN (O.S.) Where are you? \nZoe looks around. \nZOE I have no idea. \nEXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY \nZoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top. \nZoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs. \nZOE He's so not a douchebag. \nINT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nThey enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming carriage house. \nZOE I can't believe you live here. This is ridiculous. \nSTAN I just come on weekends. My parents really live here. \nZOE Oh.   Where are they now? \nSTAN In the kitchen. \n", "test2_true": "ZOE Wait, they're here? Now? Is this a \"meet the parents\" kind of thing? I wasn't prepared for this. \nSTAN No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll meet them, but-- \nZOE When you said come up for the weekend, I assumed it was just us. (then) I think I need to lay down. \nINT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face. \nSTAN Are you hung-over or something? \nZOE I'm just...not myself. Give me ten minutes. A ten-minute power nap and I'm good. I need to regroup. \nSTAN Are you sure you're okay? (then) Zoe? Hello? \nBut she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nStan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in- law. \nEDWARD Oh.   It's just you. \nSTAN She's taking a nap. \nJOAN A nap?   Now? She just got here. \nSTAN Mom, I need you to not be judgemental, okay. I like this girl a lot. \nJOAN How can I be judgemental?    We haven't even met her yet. \nWe hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall. \nJOAN (CONT'D) What the heck is that? \nThe SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head. \nSTAN Oh.   This is Nuts. \nJoan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look. \nJOAN Who's judging?! \nINT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER \nIt's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position. Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open. \nZOE What was that? \nWe hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her hands over it. \nZOE (CONT'D) Whoa. \nZoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers. \nINT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways. \nZOE (whispering) Stan? \nNo one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder. \nZOE (CONT'D) Stan! \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nZoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her. \nZOE Stan?    Hello? \nZoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the pot. It's beef stew. \nZOE (CONT'D) Oh, my God. \nShe makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon. She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it. \nZOE (CONT'D) (mouth full) Oh, my God. \nShe replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands there. And stands there some more. \nZOE (CONT'D) Oh, who am I kidding? \n", "test2_id": 1402, "test3_input": "STAN This is insane. \nINT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the little bump, new since he's last been with her. \nSTAN Do you feel any kicking? \nZOE Sometimes. \nSTAN What does it feel like? \nZOE Like butterflies. \nStan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek. \nZOE (CONT'D) Are you really sure you want to do this? \nSTAN Yeah.     I'm really sure. \nThey look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as she dozes off. \nINT. EXAM - ROOM \nCU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes floating head-to-toe. \nDr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement. \nZOE Are you okay? \nSTAN They're so...perfect.      They look like real babies. \nDR. HARRIS Would you like to know the sexes? \nThey look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe nods. Stan does, too. \nZOE Yes.     Tell us. \nDR. HARRIS You're having two healthy little girls. \nStan gets tears in his eyes. \nSTAN Two girls? \nZOE Two girls. \nDR. HARRIS Congratulations. \nEXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY \nStan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to meetings, or fighting for cabs. \nBut Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing. Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the street. \nSTAN Two girls! \nA WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.   Stan smiles. Now he's part of this exclusive club. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Hi. \nWOMAN Hi. \nINT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT \nWe PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef tells us what delectable items we are looking at. \nCHEF Here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots. This is carpaccio with shaved white truffles. And, finally, an heirloom tomato salad with fresh Buratta flown in from Italy this morning. \nSTAN Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible. \nSam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his fork and starts eating. Zoe does not. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Aren't you hungry? \nZOE I can't eat any of this. \nSTAN Why not? \nZOE (pointing to each dish) Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized. (re: champagne) Alcohol. \nSTAN Let me get Sam back. He'll make you anything you want. \nZOE I don't want to hurt his feelings. You go ahead. I'm fine. \nSTAN Well, what are you going to eat? \n", "test3_true": "The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order. \nCASHIER Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese, four large fries, and a six piece chicken McNuggets? \nZOE Make that an eight, no, ten-piece McNuggets. (to Stan) You'll have some, right? \nSTAN No. \nZOE (back to the cashier) Ten-piece. Someone will eat them. \nStan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face. \nINT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nZoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of \"What to Expect when You're Expecting.\" \nZoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion. \nZOE (re: book) Have you gotten to page 79 yet? \nSTAN No. I stopped reading when you ripped out one of my pages and used it as a napkin. \nZOE Says here many women in the second trimester experience an increased sexual appetite. \nSTAN Really? \nZoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget. She takes a seductive bite. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Are you coming on to me? It's kind of hard to tell right now. \nZOE Yeah.   I'm coming on to you. \nZoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops. \nZOE (CONT'D) What? \nSTAN You have chicken in your hair. \nINT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY \nZoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely going at all. \nMONA Why are you even working out? This is the one time in your life you're allowed to let it go. \nZOE Because look at me. I just keep getting bigger and bigger. \nMONA Well, yeah. That's kind of how it goes. \nZOE I'm afraid I'm going to scare him away. I'm like one of those giant bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to take over the whole back yard. \nMONA Come on.   He loves you for you. \nZOE I'm just getting kind of freaked out by everything. He asked me to go to this wedding with him. What kind of first impression am I going to make on all of his friends? \nMONA Well, you're knocked up with some stranger's twins. So, already you're not exactly... \nZOE Not helping. \nMONA Do you have anything to wear at least? \nINT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the closet. \nSTAN Everything okay in there? \nA cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Never mind. \nHe waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out. \nZOE (O.S.) This SUCKS!!! \nSTAN Honey, whatever you wear is fine. \nZOE (O.S.) I don't have anything to wear! That's the problem. \nAnother dress sails through the air. \nZOE (CONT'D) Fuuuuuuck! \nSTAN You always look great. I've never seen you not look great. \n", "test3_id": 1403}

Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisers and Japanese Officers watch through binoculars. Stunned. As the First Wave is routed. 
HAGLEY What the hell? 
OMURA It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny. (snaps an order) Send in the second wave. Two divisions. 
EXT.                  BARRICADES                          DAY 
Algren and Katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. We note that this barricade is the real thing. 
Katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a bullet wound beneath. Algren looks over the barricade. 
They see Imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders on the opposing hilltop. 
KATSUMOTO How long? 
ALGREN They need to regroup and report our position. Then they'll come hard. 
Katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead Imperia1soldiers. 
KA TSUMOTO It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot tell one warrior from another. 
ALGREN They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a modern army. 
KATSUMOTO Not my world anymore. 
EXT.            BATTLE FIELD                   DAY 
Bugles. The attack is reforming. Ranks now bolstered by reinforcements. 
They come at a trot, through the narrow defile, skirting the first barricade, continuing at a trot toward the second barricade. 
EXT.              2ND BARRICADE                      DAY 
Katsumoto pulls his long sword. Algren does the same. 
Katsumoto calls out an order -- the archers fire another round. 
The Imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves -- for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place. 
They race forward, stepping over their fallen comrades, bayonets poised -- 
The Mauser rifles flash -- 
Bullets explode around the samurai, many are hit. 
The Imperial Army has been trained to keep firing on the run. The waiting Samurai will be decimated, except -- 
From the hills on either side 
Fully half of the Samurai force -- who have been kept hidden until this moment... charge, screaming into the flank of the attacking Army. Even rifles cannot fire in three directions at once. 
Algren and Katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade. Some are cut down, but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand-to-band combat. 
Algren And Katsumoto fight back to back, as if one person, slashing with their swords, shattering bayonet, dealing death on all sides. 
Ujio crouches, his back leg straight and planted, his front leg bent. Still using his bow, firing off arrows with Stunning speed, refusing to budge-- 
On the opposing hillside 
Bagley and Omura watch the battle through binoculars. 
BAGLEY A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using Welt Point tactics. 
In the midst of the battle 
A charging soldier thrust     s his bayonet into Katsumoto's arm - Katsumoto kills, the soldier with his short    sword but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second soldier races toward him      for the kill - Algren spins and attacks killing the second soldier - but a third races    toward Algren, bayonet f1ashing 
He dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side -- 
Algren kicks the soldier away -- tries to use his sword but the soldier springs back ath1etically .. Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the coup de grace. 
All SOUND gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo flute... the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic. 
Bur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight, they are simply outnumbered... 
Nakao is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly around him. He is shot in the chest, and staggers a moment before continuing. Another soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range. Nakao', sword goes fl ying, so the giant Samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him. Finally, with one last lunge, he manages to pull an Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls. 
More and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately... 
The mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as Ujio is mortally wounded. The grim award master is cut through with bullets. Still he fights. An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself, and Ujio's blade cuts through the barrel. The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement before a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him. But there are too many to take the man's place, and finally fi ve men run Uji o through with bayonets, and he is pinned against the barricade, still upright in death. 
At last, what is left of this second wave of the Imperial Army, retreats. 
EXT.             PLAIN                            ALMOST SUNSET 
The plain before the barricade is littered with Imperial Army dead. 
Algren and Katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. They are both wounded. 
Only about. hundred samurai are still alive. 
Algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. Even those still alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of Imperial soldiers. 
Katsumoto is looking at Ujio's body nearby. 
KATSUMOTO He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend. 
ALGREN We won't be able to hold them back this time. 
KATSUMOTO This is not your battle. You do not have to die here. 
A long beat.

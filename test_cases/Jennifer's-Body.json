She spits out a TOOTH. \nINT. \"THE HOLE\" - SAME Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her, leaving only a shaft of light. NEEDY V.O. I wasn't always this cracked. I used to be normal-- well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones. But after the killings began, I started to feel, I don't know... loose around the edges or something. I was coming undone like those jeans I made in Home Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork. Dead inside. Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life, half eaten. Grimaces of terror. Suddenly, soft music   is piped into \"the hole,\" ostensibly to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD that we'll soon hear   again... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHEESY SONG LYRICS \"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again...\" NEEDY V.O. God, I hate this fucking song. \nNeedy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels herself for solitary confinement. DISSOLVE TO: TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIER \nEXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH) Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one stoplight. \nOn an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that reads \"WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See What's Cookin'!\" NEEDY This is where it all went down. \"Devil's Kettle\" sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall. \nEXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH) We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing over a rock face. NEEDY V.O. Well technically, it's two waterfalls. One of them is normal-- it empties into a river basin. But the other one goes into a hole. And it doesn't come out. The scientist guys can't explain it. They've dropped all kinds of things down there--bouncy balls, red dye, radioactive slime-- but nothing ever surfaces. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Maybe it's another dimension. Or, you know, just really deep. \nEXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MIDNIGHT The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still illuminated. There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the backyard. We're definitely in deep north country. NEEDY V.O. I've probably spent years of my life in this house. Hundreds of sleepovers, thousands of aimless homework sessions, a million phone calls. I've climbed through Jennifer's window so many times. But tonight, only one of us is going to come out. \nINT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin, frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed, Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair. Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH FLAGS and underwear. \nAn `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half- watches, distracted. NEEDY V.O. Jennifer didn't always look this rough. Actually, she was the prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle when she wasn't so...hungry. \nSome recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY. \nNEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) She hadn't fed in weeks. \nJennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly. We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJennifer turns her attention back to the TV. Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window, white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face disappears. Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish, sploish, sploish. \nInside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She turns out the light. A beat of silence. Then, the sound of cracking near the window. JENNIFER Huh? Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster. Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her. NEEDY You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You...ZOMBITCH! \nJennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness. Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms. \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split second, sexual control... Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing \"X\" on her torso. NEEDY (CONT'D) (HYSTERICAL) CROSS OUT JENNIFER! Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence. Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL, collapsing back onto the bed with a thud. \nNeedy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound. \nJENNIFER (CHOKING) My tit! Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT, revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY. Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom. MRS. CHECK Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God! Oh my God! She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over, gasping and bleeding. MRS. CHECK (CONT'D) (SHOCKED) Needy? Needy drops the boxcutter. It lands on Jennifer's copy of Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore. \nNEEDY Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMrs. Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like a white-trash Pieta. Jennifer takes one last breath, vomits blood, and DIES. Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES. \nEXT. JENNIFER CHECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young COP, jogs authoritatively toward the house. He shakes his head, dumbfounded. \nROMAN Christ, Needy, what have you done? \nINT. POLICE SQUAD CAR - DAWN Needy, innocent-looking in PIGTAILS, is hustled into the back of the squad car. Her clothes and face are smeared with blood. Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard- faced FEMALE COP, slides into the front seat. Her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of shellacked MALL BANGS. NEEDY Hi, Roman! How's the Force treating you? I like that jaunty cap. Blue like your balls. ROMAN How could you do this, Needy? (EMOTIONAL) You killed Jen-- Jennifer-- I mean, the victim. Are you on something? \nNEEDY Everything's going to be okay now. I rule. FEMALE COP Shut your mouth back there! NEEDY Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel? The female cop fidgets uncomfortably. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNEEDY (CONT'D) Yeah. Gracie, right? Gracie. I really like your hair, Gracie. How many cans of Salon Selectives did it take to erect that monument? The cop reaches into the backseat and SLAPS Needy, who hiccups with laughter. NEEDY (CONT'D) Watch it, Puffy Combs. That's police brutality! FEMALE COP You're one to talk about brutality, Ms. Lesnicki. You're looking at attempted murder. \nNEEDY Ugh, don't say attempted. That sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me-- I'd know. Roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road. Officer Warzak glances at him. \nNEEDY (CONT'D) Let's get our facts straight: I successfully committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there. I fucking destroyed that brat, OK? I, Needy Lesnicki, put a stop-payment on Jennifer Check. She slumps down in the backseat. NEEDY (CONT'D) Why am I even in these cuffs? I just saved every guy in this town from becoming Satan Chow.

There's a TACK stuck in her palm and it's bleeding. \nLITTLE JENNIFER OWWWWWW! (trying to swear like a grown-up) Damn! Ass! \nNeedy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes away the blood. It's still bleeding. Panicking, she leans forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound. \nJennifer watches quietly. Needy pulls away. \nLITTLE NEEDY Better. We should get a Band-Aid though. \nLITTLE JENNIFER We're sisters now, you know. \nNeedy nods. \nLITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D) Don't tell my mom about this.

JENNIFER'S VOICE What's up, Monistat? \nNeedy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified. Jennifer is curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually. She's freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky T- shirts. Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of bed, pulling the covers with her. JENNIFER God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche. NEEDY Get out! JENNIFER But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties. She winks conspiratorially at Needy. \nNEEDY What the fuck is happening? JENNIFER Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'? \nNEEDY I saw you! I saw you! The car...the...I... JENNIFER (MIMICKING) Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped. NEEDY I'm calling the police. JENNIFER Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNEEDY What do you want? JENNIFER I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Remember the night of the fire? NEEDY Yeah, it rings a bell. JENNIFER Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van. \nINT. SOFT SHOULDER'S VAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT \nJennifer is crouched in the back of the van. None of the band members are speaking. Nikolai Wolf drives down a gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the woods. \nJENNIFER Guys? Where are we going? \nNIKOLAI Shut your mouth, object. \nDIRK (NERVOUSLY) Nikolai... \nJennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed. There's glow-in- the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls: goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. She sees a few books sliding around on the floor: \"Spells and Incantations,\" \"Summoning the Beast,\" and a copy of the Black Mass. \nJennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the side door.

Needy screams and covers her mouth. JENNIFER (CONT'D) No biggie. Watch. She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly. Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) That's some X-Men shit, right? NEEDY What do you mean, \"when you're full\"? JENNIFER You know. Full. Like full of tasty morsels. Needy shakes her head, not comprehending. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Forget it. You'd probably tell on me anyway. Not that anyone would believe you. You always think the world is coming to an end.

We can play \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" like we used to. She smiles seductively. \nNeedy crawls further away from her, shivering. Jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed.

Nothing there but the wind. Jennifer's gone. \nEXT. OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel path runs through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is taking place. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFaint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery, flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc. These are Colin Gray's friends. \nOne girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on the path as she stumbles along, weeping. At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative- looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back, looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic priest. PRIEST We gather here today to celebrate the life of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of... The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral. The priest clears his throat disapprovingly. PRIEST (CONT'D) What is this disturbance? \nMR. GRAY These are Colin's friends. A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly. GOTH BOY Colin! Take me with you! I belong down there! In the DAAAARKNESS! GOTH GIRL No, Kevin. Those are just his fleshly remains. He's among the dark angels of the realm now. Fly, Colin. Fly into the firmament. She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air. Colin's father gags, appalled. GOTH BOY Is it cool if we camp here for a few days? We want to commune with his corpse. He was our spooky homeboy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPRIEST Children, this is a private service for family only. GOTH GIRL (to Colin's mother) Oh, right. I need to ask you something, Mrs. Gray. It's really important for me to have closure. PRIEST Young lady, have some respect for this family... MRS. GRAY (waving him off) No. It's fine. \nGOTH GIRL Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed? \n", "test3_true": "GOTH GIRL (CONT'D) Oh God. Oh God. I knew it!

GOTH BOY Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin. All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine. GOTH GIRL That's WORSE! She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the dirt like a toddler. Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her. \nGOTH BOY Colin wouldn't have liked this. MRS. GRAY (losing it) Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah, you're right! I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and buried before his eighteenth birthday! Wow, you must have known him so well! MR. GRAY Jill... The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done ranting yet. MRS. GRAY By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know-- I had to identify the remains. My boy's not in the realm of the undead. He's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. He's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown. She kicks the coffin to illustrate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nMRS. GRAY (CONT'D) So you can take your pain and shove it up your asses, kids. I got the monopoly on pain! The kids stare at her in awe. Needy watches as Mrs. Gray collapses into Mr. Gray's arms. \nEXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - DAY Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence surrounding the football field. It says \"TURNABOUT DANCE OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE.\" Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka. She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in days. There are hollows beneath her eyes. NEEDY V.O. They did a big memorial assembly for Colin at school, and we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system and how to deal with grief. But nobody seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was last week's emotion. \nWe see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing with some other flag team members. \nNEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since our encounter in my room. Actually, I hadn't really spoken to anyone. I was busy with research. Paranormal research. Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief, gruesome HALLUCINATIONS: Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse, the lower half of her face rotted away. Jennifer as a harlequin monster. Needy hears the rush of her own blood, the barely audible buzzing of flies... Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie. CHIP Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet? I don't get paid until next week. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNEEDY I gotta show you something. CHIP What is it? NEEDY Not here. Behind the school. CHIP What is it? NEEDY Evidence. CHIP (WEARILY) Is this about Jennifer? \nNEEDY Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y-- CHIP (INTERRUPTING) Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared of what's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up. NEEDY Please just let me show you. Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option but to submit. He nods reluctantly. \nEXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school. Melting snow drips off the eaves. Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's full of copies from the library and Internet printouts. The spine reads \"JENNIFER RESEARCH\" \nNEEDY Look at this. She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIP's hands. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHIP (CONFUSED) Demon...demonic... NEEDY Demonic transference. It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin! CHIP stares at her. NEEDY (CONT'D) I think that's what happened to Jennifer. Those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods. But what they didn't realize is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high! Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster! It all makes sense now! Read this... She grabs the piece of paper from him. NEEDY (CONT'D) (READING) \"If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon.\" See? CHIP looks more dubious than ever. \nCHIP Uh-huh. NEEDY She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this... She holds up one of the printouts. NEEDY (CONT'D) It says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. Like I saw! \n", "test3_id": 1187}

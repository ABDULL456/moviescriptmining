BACK TO ED AND SHARI 
ED What?... Why? 
SHARI (starting to weep) I can't take it anymore... 
GUYS WHO DON'T THINK SHE'S HOT 
They mock her, crying "Boo hoo hoo" and pretending to rub their eyes. 
BACK TO ED AND SHARI 
SHARI (crying) I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! 
ED Shari... 
SHARI Everybody hates me! 
ED No. Who? 
SHARI Look at this. 
She picks up a N.Y. POST. 
SHARI (CONT'D) Page three of the Post. 
ED (knows what it is) Ohh... 
SHARI A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no." (crying) They hate me! 
ED Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care. (to the camera) Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... (he can't do the math) 
SHARI Twenty-nine. 
ED Exactly. Boy, you're smart. (to the camera) Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you? (picks up newspaper) "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I? (sarcastically) Who the hell do you think I should be dating? 
SHARI There's a list. 
ED Really? (he looks) 
SHARI Ed? 
He doesn't hear her. He's scanning the list. 
ED Wow...

JOHN Yeah. You did good. What's wrong? 
ED Aah, I wanted Shari to come. 
JOHN Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?

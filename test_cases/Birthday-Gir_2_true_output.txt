She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last. Blows smoke. She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size, and the theme returns. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
John is on the telephone. 
JOHN ...It might just be a twenty-four hour bug... 
INT. BANK - DAY 
Clare listens, concerned. 
CLARE Well you just get better. I'll tell Beaky. You just get some rest, ok? 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
John puts the phone down. He looks down the hall, where Nadia is killing ants on the table, with her dictionary. He smiles. 
EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY 
A shot from above, of the Rover's windscreen, reflecting the passing trees. 
The roof is down. We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's body, in the passenger seat. Her face is upturned slightly, she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees. 
INT. JOHN'S LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Nadia sits alone at the dining room table. Suddenly the lights go out. John enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing with candles. 
The light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across their faces. 
He sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite Nadia 
JOHN Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Nadia... 
The front doorbell rings. A loud long burst. Nadia's face transforms into a big grin. She hurries out into the hall, leaving John alone with the cake. Nadia whooping and shouting excitedly. Other voices. Shouting. Shouting in Russian. 
A man bursts in carrying Nadia in his arms. He spins her round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes to the table where he blows out the candles. They are plunged into darkness. 
Lots of whooping and laughing. A Zippo flares up and illuminates some faces, all laughing. 
CUT TO: 
John's hand groping along the wall. It finds the light switch. 
There are two men here. One small and wiry, one big and dark, like Rasputin. They each carry rucksacks and a guitar case. 
YURI You must be John. You seem very nice. Excuse me. 
In Russian, the first man introduces Nadia to the other man, who is relighting the candles with a Zippo. It seems they haven't met before. 
The first man, Yuri, pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands it to John. 
YURI How's that? We can't drink our piss can we? 
JOHN Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you? 
YURI You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates. 
JOHN What are you doing here? 
Yuri stops. 
YURI Sorry. You've lost me... 
JOHN I'm asking what you're here for. 
YURI What? 
Yuri speaks to Nadia in fast Russian.

Theo jerks awake. His car is parked by the Fazeli house. It is a clear, blustery day. A gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then SLAMS it shut. He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the house. 
68     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 68 
Theo walks into the house. The place is completely trashed. Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. He makes his way to the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back. He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head as he reaches for the doorknob. This time, he thrusts the door open. The bathroom is empty. Relieved, he cradles the ball in his arms. 
BALL Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his forearm, dripping off his elbow. Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of the ball. Blood streams out of the three finger holes. He drops the ball to the floor. He goes into the bathroom and turns on the sink faucets. 
INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, BATHROOM 
Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands and arms. He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and looks up to the mirror. "NOK NOK" is smeared in blood across his reflection. 
69     EXT. 7-ELEVEN PHONE BOOTH - DAY			69 
Theo waits through several rings. 
GRACE Hello? 
THEO Hello, mom? 
GRACE Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright? 
THEO I found dad. 
GRACE He's dead, isn't he. (pauses) Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born. 
THEO Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. 
GRACE You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you? 
THEO I gotta go. Love ya mom. 
Theo hangs up the phone. Alfie shuffles over. 
ALFIE Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out. 
THEO (stunned) The pin machine? 
ALFIE Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away. 
70     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES				 70 
Theo pulls into the parking lot. The place is cordoned off with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with "Bowling Police - Do Not Cross". A black bowling police van, its blue light spinning, is parked in front. Bowling cops herd dwarfs and customers into the van. Mothers and daughters mill around behind the yellow tape. A group of little people brandish "Right to Work" signs. Theo gets out of his car. The crowd moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the door. 
LITTLE GIRL There he is! 
Camera flashes POP all over the place. Two black-jacketed bowling cops step out behind him. They are Sid and Breeze. 
BREEZE Bowling police, step back, give him room. 
SID Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball. 
LITTLE GIRL Mr. Kastle, we know you wouldn't do anything bad.

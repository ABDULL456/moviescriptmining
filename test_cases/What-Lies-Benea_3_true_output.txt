CLAIRE He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one. 
NORMAN And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic-- 
CLAIRE No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I... (frustrated, she grabs the photos) All right, look at this. 
She triumphantly thrusts one before him.  Norman looks at it. 
NORMAN Our house. 
CLAIRE No.  Look!  In the window. 
The ROSES.  She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED WINDOW of the study.  Norman takes it over to the light. 
NORMAN It's a flare. 
CLAIRE A flare? 
NORMAN From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass. 
CLAIRE It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me! 
NORMAN (making sure he's got it) It's a ghost. 
Norman shakes his head.  He looks again at the picture, does a quick calculation. 
NORMAN You took this in the morning, didn't you? 
She nods slightly. 
NORMAN When the sun would be exactly right. 
She's got him. 
CLAIRE Then why isn't it in any of the other pictures? 
She thrusts the batch at him.  He peruses the other few shots of the garden. 
NORMAN A cloud passed.  Or it's a bounce off the lake.  See? 
She looks.  He might not be wrong. 
CLAIRE Where is she then? 
NORMAN She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know. 
CLAIRE Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this. 
She leads him out of the room. 
INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly. 
CLAIRE See? 
NORMAN What am I looking at? 
CLAIRE (indicating completed solitaire game) I didn't do that. 
NORMAN Who did?  Mrs. Feur? 
CLAIRE Maybe.  Point is...not me. 
NORMAN Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him? 
CLAIRE She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but-- 
NORMAN Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed? 
CLAIRE Dressed? 
NORMAN Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl. 
CLAIRE When? 
NORMAN What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since... 
CLAIRE (she seems confused) Oh. 
NORMAN ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this? 
CLAIRE Tonight? 
NORMAN Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--

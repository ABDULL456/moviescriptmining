{"train": "SHIFTY \nWritten by \nEran Creevy \n1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING \nA large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway. \n2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING \nAt the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3. \n3   INT. COACH. MORNING \nLong shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's \"Brighter Day\", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye. \nThe track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text. \n4   EXT. STREET. MORNING \nWe follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War. \nCUT TO: \nWe reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up. \nSHIFTY \nSuddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence, making a short cut. \n5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING \nBird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose. \nSIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS. \n6    INT. COACH. MORNING. \nChris stares out of the window. The music still playing on his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN. \n7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING \nGlen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table. \n8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING \nJasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast. \n9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING \nShifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end. \n10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING \nSuddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits. \n11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING \nIn an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation. \n12   INT. COACH. MORNING \nChris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across. \n13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING \nGlen splits the cocaine into two piles. \nCHRIS No, not yet. \nREZ Gay? \nCHRIS No... you? \nREZ I'm asking the questions padre... for your information... no, I'm not... but Shifty is. \nSHIFTY Jokes. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) (to Chris) What have you got, rent or mortgage? \nCHRIS Fucking hell, tag team... Mortgage. \nREZ That's nice. \nSHIFTY Yeah, mature, man. \nA BEAT. \nREZ Why do you leave without saying goodbye to my brother? \nChris is stumped. Shifty looks down at the floor. \nSHIFTY Rez, man... \nREZ I'm only joking... \nA BEAT. \nREZ (CONT'D) But really, why? \nSHIFTY Leave him alone. \nREZ I need info, man. I'm like a sponge, do you know what I mean, I'm like a flannel... How come your back, what's the deal? \nSHIFTY I invited him to a party. \nREZ Who's party? \nCHRIS Rachel's. \nREZ Rachel who? \nSHIFTY Rachel Price. \nREZ Who? \nSHIFTY Mate, Rachel and Serena. \nRez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy stare. \nREZ Oh right. \nChris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic. \nSHIFTY (to Rez) You remember Rachel, you fucking lunged her at Jazzbo Browns? \nREZ WHAT... that's BULLSHIT. \nCHRIS Yeah, yeah, you went in for the kill and she lent away like she was doing the fucking limbo. \nChris is back in the conversation. \nSHIFTY Her ponytail swept the floor. \nShifty and Chris touch fists. \nTREVOR Do me a favour, I've probably put your fucking kids through college, do you know what I mean? \nSHIFTY Mate, keep your voice down. \nA BEAT. \nShifty considers. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) Meet me at the top of the road by the telephone box. \nTREVOR Mate you're a fucking diamond. \n42   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING \nStill watching Chris, Rez speaks. \nREZ For some reason... I dunno why... he still thinks of you as his best mate. \nHe get's up to leave. \nREZ (CONT'D) Why don't you try acting like one. \nWE'RE TIGHT ON CHRIS. HE'S TAKEN ABACK BY REZ'S COMMENT. \n43   INT/EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / HALLWAY. MORNING \nTrevor goes to walk away. \nSHIFTY Trevor... \nTREVOR Yes mate... \nSHIFTY Don't ever fucking come to my house again. \nTREVOR Yeah, no worries, I'm sorry, man. \nShifty walks in, shutting the door. Rez walks past him to go upstairs. \nREZ Who was that? \nSHIFTY Nothing, geezer wanted to talk to me about a job. \nREZ What job. \nSHIFTY Labouring. \nRez ascends the stairs. \nREZ What did you say? \nSHIFTY I'd think about it. \nShifty goes to walk off. \n44   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. MORNING. \nRez, reaching the top of the stairs, calls down. \nREZ Shafiq. \nSHIFTY (O.S.) What! \nREZ Don't forget. \nSHIFTY (O.S.) What? \nREZ Mum and dads. \nSHIFTY (O.S.) (PAKISTANI) Do me a favour. \nCHRIS You gonna go? \nSHIFTY Am I fuck. \n52   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY \nTrevor drives slowly past the house to see Rez putting out the rubbish. Rez turns around and stares at Trevor. Trevor looks away and drives off. \n53   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / UP STAIRS BATHROOM. DAY \nJasmine sits on the toilet, she opens a pregnancy test and urinates onto it. \nINT. TREVORS' HOUSE. BATHROOM (PART 1) / FREDDIE'S BEDROOM. DAY (PART 2) \nFreddie is on his games console. He's at the controls of a racing game. It's on really loud. \nCUT TO: \nHolding up the pregnancy test Jasmine see's it turn to a plus sign. She's pregnant again. \nCUT TO: \nTight on the screen as Freddie's computerised car screeches around a corner. \nCUT TO: \nJasmine stares forward, her face fretful. \nCUT TO: \nFreddie's car smashes loudly against a barrier. \nCUT TO: \nSitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the tiled surface. She rubs her finger over it to reveal the residue of a white powder. \nCUT TO: \nThe game is loud. Echoing through the house. \nCUT TO: \nShe dabs finger with tongue, her face sours. She was almost hoping she was wrong. \nCUT TO: \nFreddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent. \nCUT TO: \nJasmine's eyes are alive with rage; the TV bellows out - suddenly she stands, pulls up her kickers and steams towards Freddie's room. \nJASMINE (screaming) TURN THAT FUCKING TV DOWN BEFORE I THROW IT OUT OF THE FUCKING WINDOW! \nFreddie little face is totally bewildered. \n55   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY \nShifty and Chris approach a clapped out, red four-door VW Golf circa 1986. As they loom closer Glen exits the car from the back. \nGLEN What you saying you fucking rag- head, you alright bad boy? \nSHIFTY Dowdy! \nGLEN You been on the roids mate you're looking bigger? \nShifty's almost exasperated with Glen already. \nSHIFTY No, I haven't, no. \nRez lays down a prayer mat. He kneels down and begins to pray. \n57   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY \nGlen stands smoking, staring at Chris.   Suddenly Glen speaks. \nGLEN I fucking... I swear I know you from somewhere? \nA BEAT. \nChris can feel Glen's eyes on him. \nCHRIS I dunno... \nGLEN I do, I know you from somewhere. \nChris stays silent. \nGLEN (CONT'D) D'you used to knock out pills? \nCHRIS (dismissive) Yeah, now and again. \nGlen carries on staring at him. \nGLEN Yeah, yeah, I know where I fucking know you from... you used to go out with Serena Ellis? \nCHRIS Yeah, a few years ago? \nGLEN You'd fucking hope so, she's dead you cunt. \nGlen laughs at his own joke. Chris looks furious. Shifty walks back over. \nSHIFTY Come! \nGLEN Right you done? (Shifty nods) Good. (MORE) GLEN (CONT'D) (he takes a final drag on his fag) Don't go blowing up any fucking tube trains. \nGlen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and storms off, Shifty follows after him. \n58   INT. LENNY'S CAR. DAY \nViewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it to Lenny. \nGLEN What are we waiting for? \nLENNY Give me a fucking break I'm rushing my tits off... \nLenny attempts to start the car. \nLENNY (CONT'D) Where's the keys babe? \nLORETTA Let's just go Lenny. I'm freaking out. \nLenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive off, frog-hopping the VW down the road. \nGLEN Yeah, it's a good job we're not making a fucking scene. \n59   EXT. ROW OF GARAGES. DAY \nChris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris stands there for a moment his fists clenched. \nSHIFTY Mate, are you alright? \nCHRIS Yeah, I'm fine. \nSHIFTY What's the matter, what did he say? \nCHRIS Geezer don't worry about, just...don't worry about it, it's cool, I'm alright. \n60   EXT/INT. BUILDING SITE. DAY \nCHRIS What happened to her face? \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY Apparently... Glen... I think... injected her with some fucking cocktail... I dunno... smack, I think... he passed out first... she passed out... but apparently she was lying up against a radiator... the fucking thing came on full whack. She was so out of it, she didn't even know it was on.... \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) ...the paramedics had to peel her off. \nCHRIS Jesus Christ! \nChris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He hits reject. \n62   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY \nTrevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his dashboard. \n63   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY \nRez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine. \nREZ FUCK! \nHe tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks in the gap, and sees something. \nHe sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through, watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez sits back against the machine just staring at it. \n64   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY \nShifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something. \nCHRIS What's that? \nSHIFTY What? \nChris points. \nCHRIS That fucking thing. \n65   EXT. PARK. DAY \nShifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam are two handles. \nCHRIS What does it fucking do? \nChris grabs the handles and starts moving with it. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Mate, grab the other end. \nShifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) FUCKING HELL! \nSHIFTY SHIIIIIIIIT! \nThey're both cracking up laughing, loving it. \n66   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY \nOn Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum. \nWE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM WATCHING HER. \n67   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY. \nA fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms. \n68   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY \nSHIFTY Yeah. \nVALERIE Are you sure it wasn't two thirty. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY It may have been. \nVALERIE I was out on the balcony at two thirty. \nA BEAT. \nVALERIE (CONT'D) But I was in here at two. \nA BEAT. \nVALERIE (CONT'D) I'll make us some tea. \nSHIFTY Yeah, that'll be sweet. \nINT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY \nChris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this. \nCUT TO: \nChris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. \nChris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle. \nINT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY \nValerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the counter top. \nSHIFTY How you been, alright. \nVALERIE Yeah, I'm alright babe, you alright? \nSHIFTY Yeah, I'm alright. \nVALERIE Good, good. \nSilence as Valerie prepares the tea. \nSHIFTY She visited you yet? \nVALERIE No... not for a long time, Shifty... not seen her for a long time really, darling. \nShifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He places a hand on her arm. \nSHIFTY She'll come back one day. \nThey carry on making the tea. \nINT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY \nThe drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. \nWe're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some. \nCHRIS No, no, I'm fine......thanks though. \nCLOSE ON SHIFTY. \nSHIFTY Look Val we're gonna have to do one... \nTHE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO SHIFTY... \nShifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) (with threat) YEAH? \nAt that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the situation. \nOTIS Yeah, alright, yeah. \nSHIFTY Because if I hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, I'll come back here and I'll take your TV, I'll take your stereo, and I'll shove em up your birds arse. \nHe lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) Do you understand me? \nOtis nods. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? \nOTIS Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I'm sorry. \nSilence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis' wall. \nSHIFTY Call me if you need any more weed. \nHe walks into the hallway, past Chris. \nCHRIS (almost disdain) You don't miss a fucking trick. \nSHIFTY You know it. \n78   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAY \nShifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates. \nCLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB. \nShifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS That was all a bit fucking surreal. \nSHIFTY What d'you mean? \nCHRIS I can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad. \nShifty laughs as they carry on descending. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) How old is she? \nSHIFTY About 70. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) She's been doing drugs longer than we've been alive. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS Yeah, d'you reckon. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) When did you start knocking out? \nSHIFTY Knocking out what? \nCHRIS (lowers his voice) Crack. \nSHIFTY I dunno, about...three, three and a half years ago. \nA BEAT. \nJASMINE Where are you? \nTREVOR Where do you think. I'm on site. \nJASMINE It doesn't sound like it... \nA BEAT. \nTREVOR Babe, look I've got to go, \nJASMINE Well what should I do about the car? \nTREVOR Babe, I've gotta go, Bob's calling me... we'll talk about it later... I'll call you... \nCLICK! He puts down the phone. \n82   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY \nJasmine sits there for a moment, slightly distracted, then carries on painting with the kids, her mind elsewhere. \n83   EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE. DAY \nShifty and Chris walk in silence. Chris looks about at the buildings, his eyes searching across the domain that he once knew so well. \nCHRIS Did you tell Rachel? \nSHIFTY What? \nCHRIS About me. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY No, I didn't. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) I thought it'd be a surprise. \nChris looks a little uncomfortable. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) Mate, it's gonna be fine. \nCHRIS Who else is gonna be there? \nSHIFTY I dunno, lot of her new mates, I don't know many of them. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS So what's the plan, are you gonna go and see your mum and dad first? \nShifty looks at him. \nSHIFTY No. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS You should go man, see what they've got to say? \nSHIFTY I thought you worked in recruitment. \nCHRIS What? \nSHIFTY When do you become a fucking family liaison? \nCHRIS What are you talking about you nutter, I was just saying? \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY I'll be stuck in some fucking warehouse... looking after twenty Bengalis... knocking out dodgy Fruit of the Looms.... I know exactly who they want me to meet, man. \nChris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but Shifty's like a whippet. \nSHIFTY Follow me. \nShifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows. \n85   EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY \nMalik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in a shitty garden pond. \nMALIK Fuck. \n86   EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY \nShifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind. \nSHIFTY This is bollocks. \nShifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention. \n87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY \nShifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag whipping off the back. \nTHE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE CYCLE TRACK. \nIt's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as Shifty. \nEXT. GROSVENOR ROAD CUT THRU. DAY. \nShifty sits in an underpass. Random graffiti tarnishes the walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall. Chris is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard. \nCHRIS Mate, I'm telling you, this is no way to live. \nChris sits down next to Shifty. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I'm serious, mate, you need to get away from this shit, come and live with me for a bit. \nShifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling out a pack of fags. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I'm serious, mate... Why not? \nShifty doesn't say anything. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) You'd love Manchester, man, it's full of fitness. \nShifty stays quiet, and smokes. They sit their for a moment. \nSHIFTY I can't just fuck off. \nCHRIS Yeah, you can. \nShifty looks at Chris. \nSHIFTY Yeah, but I wouldn't mate... I don't want to...

He walks over to Loretta and pulls back the sheets. He leans over and starts kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse. \nLORETTA Glen, I'm not in the mood. \nSHIFTY Fuck that. \nCHRIS Why? \nSHIFTY You always kick off. \nCHRIS No I don't. \nSHIFTY Mate, last time you drank a bottle of whisky you pissed on my leg. \nCHRIS Bollocks! \nChris is laughing. \nSHIFTY In a club. \nCHRIS What! \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY In front of the bouncer. \nCHRIS Oh yeah, I remember. \nChris cracks up. \nSHIFTY I gotta do one last drop off and we can chill out. \n93   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY \nWe see Trevor walk back to the van, in his hand he has a can of beer. Getting in, he settles down and begins to unwrap his gram of coke on the passenger seat. He places down the can to take a hit when suddenly he knocks it, spilling beer all over the cocaine. \nTREVOR No, no, no, no, oh fuck, oh fucking hell. \nHe's at it.

Chris is watching Shifty. \nCHRIS I tell you what? \nSHIFTY What? \nCHRIS I could fucking smash one of your mum's curry's. \nShifty looks at Chris straight in the eyes. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Do you think she would have made food? \nSHIFTY Always. \nA BEAT. \nCHRIS We could still make it, man. \nShifty looks at Chris. \nA BEAT. \n105   INT.

NOW! \nAt that moment, Trevor lowers his knife, Shifty takes heed and grabs him, swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into Trevor's face.

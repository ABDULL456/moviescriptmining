VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY \nChris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this. \nCUT TO: \nChris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. \nChris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle. \nINT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY \nValerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the counter top. \nSHIFTY How you been, alright. \nVALERIE Yeah, I'm alright babe, you alright? \nSHIFTY Yeah, I'm alright. \nVALERIE Good, good. \nSilence as Valerie prepares the tea. \nSHIFTY She visited you yet? \nVALERIE No... not for a long time, Shifty... not seen her for a long time really, darling. \nShifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He places a hand on her arm. \nSHIFTY She'll come back one day. \nThey carry on making the tea. \nINT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY \nThe drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. \nWe're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some. \nCHRIS No, no, I'm fine......thanks though. \nCLOSE ON SHIFTY. \nSHIFTY Look Val we're gonna have to do one... \nTHE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO SHIFTY... \nShifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen. \n", "test3_true": "Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried on walking. \nSHIFTY Geezer, give me a minute. \nChris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n' bass booming out. \n73A                                                                   * INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY \nShifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out. \nSHIFTY Alright mate? \nOTIS Alright. \nShifty looks about at the room. \nSHIFTY What's your name? \nOTIS Otis. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY Where do you get your weed from? \nOTIS It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here...

VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY \nChris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16, pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat. \n77   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY \nSHIFTY I'm gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down. \nA BEAT. \nSHIFTY (CONT'D) Yeah? \nA BEAT. \n", "test3_id": 2651}

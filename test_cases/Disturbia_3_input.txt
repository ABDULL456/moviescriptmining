Giles drags Kale into... 
101   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                              101 
... To reveal a bruised but conscious JULIE tied to the chair, her arms wrapped behind it! Kale's eyes widen with rage as he pulls free of Giles, drops to the floor, tries to roll away. But Giles grabs him back up, gets in his face -- 
GILES If you don't stop fighting me, I will gut her like a fish. 
Kale glares as Giles drags him into the... 
102   ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                    102 
...And pulls him up the stairs... 
103   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER                        103 
Giles SLAMS Kale down in his desk chair. Giles eyes the DV CAM sitting on the TV. The tape slot's open. 
GILES So where's the tape? 
Kale mumbles a muffled "FUCK YOU" under the duct tape. 
GILES (CONT'D) You're right, I'll find it later.

Giles sits on Kale's bed. Eyes the book on serial killers. He picks it up, flips through it. 
GILES (CONT'D) It's funny, I hear a lot of authors say their first books were easy, it's the second one that's really hard. Wonder if your dad thought that. (off Kale's glare) See with me, it's the opposite. The very first one was... (sickly reminiscing) ...Very difficult... she was very beautiful... fragile... a lot of promise... the others in Texas were flings, low class... Patty Walsh had potential, but so did Amy. You saw her, right? When you were watching me? You should feel good, Kale, you guys saved her life. I was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale. Savor the moment. (tosses the book) You have Microsoft Word? (off Kale's questioning look; re: computer) Turn it on. 
Kale doesn't move.    Giles raises the bat: 
GILES (CONT'D) I can type, you know. 
Kale turns to the computer, lifts his taped wrists to the keyboard. 
GILES (CONT'D) "Dear Ashley... I killed Ronnie and my mom because... (re: Kale not typing) What's wrong? Hey, you're the one who couldn't leave me alone. Truthfully, I'm sick of covering my tracks. You think I like spending my spare time looking over my shoulder for people like you? Word of advice, if you ever need to hurt someone, think everything through. Because you do get a taste for it, don't you? (MORE)

GILES (CONT'D) But damned if people aren't just waiting to stand in your way... cops, reporters, determined relatives, nosy fucking neighbors... next thing you know, you're on tilt, you can't think straight, you're clocking your teacher in front of the whole class, me... I'm hitting a damned deer... Man, that was some shitty luck. (then) Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've gotta clean this up. The irony is, you've done all the hard stuff. Whaddaya think: "Troubled youth finally snapped." Maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend, or maybe he just couldn't deal with the guilt from not saving daddy. (off Kale) Hey, you Googled me. 
Giles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly does SNAP. He leans forward, grabs the LCD computer monitor with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and HURLS it at GILES, SMACKING HIM on the side of his head -- a one in a hundred shot! Giles goes down. 
But the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. Kale falls to the floor, scrambles for the BASEBALL BAT just inches away -- 
GILES 
staggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat, rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward, and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face! Kale staggers back, but somehow keeps his balance and the bat. He spins around, hops to the door into... 
104   INT. 2ND FL HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            104 
Kale rounds the corner and runs smack into ASHLEY.   The collision sends Kale back to the floor. 
ASHLEY KALE -- 
Ashley leans down to Kale. Kale gestures with his eyes and head: BEHIND YOU! Ashley gets the message, whirls around just as Giles GRABS HER. Ashley SCREAMS and knees Giles.

He drops her to the floor. Ashley scrambles for Kale, helps him to his feet, pulls Kale back down the hall to... 
105   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            105 
Ashley shoves Kale inside as she spins back, SLAMS the office door in Giles' face, locks it. Giles BANGS on the door. 
Ashley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth.   Kale SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone. 
KALE It's dead. 
Ashley grabs a pair of scissors off dad's desk, cuts Kale's ankles and hands free. Kale reaches down to the ankle bracelet, furiously tugs at it. 
ASHLEY Let me try -- 
Ashley moves in, tries to cut it loose with the scissors as Giles suddenly SLAMS SOMETHING against the door, trying to break it down! 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Where's your mom -- 
KALE (tugging on bracelet) Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen -- (then; re: bracelet) GODDAMN YOU!! 
ASHLEY (giving up with scissors) Okay, just -- I'll get your mom, you figure out a way to call the cops -- 
KALE No, I've gotta get her -- 
ASHLEY Kale, you've gotta get outside, get over the boundary -- do you hear me? 
KALE (beat; then; an idea sparking) Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff --

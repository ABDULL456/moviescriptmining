INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs. 
Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above. They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop. 
MOUNTIE Go around the other side!    Cut him off! 
The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of Northcott. 
EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT 
Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast. 
Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground...and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop. 
He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running. The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on. 
SECOND MOUNTIE Go on!   Get the bastard! 
He nods and continues the chase. Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him. 
Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short. He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free -- 
-- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming. 
Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction -- 
-- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   97. 
They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge. 
With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the Mountie backs off just a bit -- 
MOUNTIE Screw this...I'm too old for this fightin' shit.... 
-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two-story roof and DOWN into -- 
-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned by Gordon. 
As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose. 
MOUNTIE YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST! 
And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers. 
INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Christine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties. 
BRIEGLEB Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a friend of mine, Mr. Hahn. 
CHRISTINE Hello. HAHN Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Can we come in? 
CHRISTINE Yes...of course. 
She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under: 
CHRISTINE Mr. Hahn, was it? 
HAHN Yes. 
CHANGELING A True Story                          98. 
CHRISTINE I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's. 
HAHN But he was identified, was he not? 
CHRISTINE Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me. 
HAHN It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five years ago. There's not a day goes by I don't think, I should mention this to Claudine... then I remember she's not here. 
CHRISTINE I'm sorry.     Please, sit. 
They do as Christine looks to Briegleb. 
CHRISTINE I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary. 
REV. BRIEGLEB I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety. 
CHRISTINE Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Jut one problem. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    99. 
REV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) Not one lawyer outside this room was willing to take on the Police Department. Too risky, they said. So finally I went to the very best attorney in town, a man who's sued the city four times and won. Unfortunately, we could never afford to hire him. 
CHRISTINE (crestfallen) I see.... 
HAHN Which is why I'm doing this pro bono. (a smile) It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen years as a lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice. 
REV. BRIEGLEB Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the City Council involved.

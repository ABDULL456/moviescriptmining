CLERK Just take this down the hall to the regis- trar.  Hurry up though, it's near closing time. Most everyone's gone home already. 
A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor. 
112  INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE                                       112 
Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS sit in an office mostly cleared of employees. 
Brenna hands the slip to a clerk. 
CLERK #2 I'll be right back. 
She disappears into the rear area. 
BRENNA (to other clerk) Do you have a drinking fountain? 
CLERK #3 Around the corner. 
Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling with her hair. 
THE CLERK 
Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the counter top and looks around the office. 
The second clerk is also gone. 
Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk. She steps over to it. 
It is a large blood stain. 
Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors. They're closed. 
Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them. She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight walking to her with his stained sword. 
With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and runs down an opposite corridor. 
THE KNIGHT 
Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM of his palm. 
BRENNA 
Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for a way out. 
The Knight is nearly upon her. 
In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing its heavy door. 
THE CLOSET 
Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING is at a PANIC. 
THE KNIGHT 
Tries the door handle. Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into the wood. 
BRENNA (crying) Oh God... 
He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround- ing walls. 
BRENNA Go away!  Oh God, go away! 
CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch. 
THE KNIGHT 
Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing. Brenna SCREAMS. The door collapses. 
113  EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING                                        113 
A group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light of day. 
114  INT. CAR                                                      114 
At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector. 
114  INT. HOME - NIGHT                                             114 
Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room, poking at it with a tong. 
His gaze goes to a mantle clock. It is 10:30 PM. 
The phone RINGS. He looks to it. It RINGS again. He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear. 
KNIGHT'S VOICE We have some unfinished business.

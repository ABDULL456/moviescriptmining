As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear. 
JAMES LEER This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. 
GRADY Is he ail right? 
CRABTREE (rolling his eyes) He's fine. He's narrating. 
JAMES LEER We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time. 
SARA Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here. 
As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak. 
MISS SLOVIAK I need a ride. 
GRADY I'm your man. 
24	EXT. STREET 24 
As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase. 
GRADY There's an explanation. 
MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, unzips her suitcase. 
25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING 
As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS. 
MISS SLOVIAK Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? 
GRADY James is. ..I don't know... 
MISS SLOVIAK Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed. 
GRADY I'm not sure that's possible. 
MISS SLOVIAK Sure it is. 
GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her forehead. 
GRADY Listen, Antonia-- 
MISS SLOVIAK Tony. Now that I'm home. 
GRADY Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. 
MISS SLOVIAK Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? 
Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself. 
GRADY He's writing his name in water. 
MISS SLOVIAK What's that? 
GRADY Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. 
MISS SLOVIAK That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. 
GRADY He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit. 
Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks. 
MISS SLOVIAK You mean because his career's ruined and all? 
GRADY Jesus. Is that what he told you? 
MISS SLOVIAK He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of .a. . . 
As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse of his own swollen eyes. 
MISS SLOVIAK ...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good that he'll be able to keep his job. 
Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points. 
MISS SLOVIAK (cont'd) Turn here. 
26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE 
GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a little white BAND SHELL painted with stars. 
GRADY That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. 
MISS SLOVIAK It's a bathtub. What she's standing under. 
The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN squints through the screen door. 
MISS SLOVIAK There's Pop. (turning) Let me see it. The gun. 
GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony smirks.

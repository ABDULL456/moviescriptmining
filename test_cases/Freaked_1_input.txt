BLAM! BLAM! The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen FBI AGENTS rush in with guns drawn. 
FBI CHIEF Freeze, FBI! 
Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze. 
ANOTHER FBI GUY Looks like they took care of Skuggs, chief. 
The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks. 
CHIEF Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this. 
RICK Great. But how did you-- 
CHIEF We've been following Skuggs for years. Scrappy just filled in some of the details. 
SCRAPPY Yap! 
FBI CHIEF Thank heavens you brought him to justice, Rick. God only knows how far his sick plans would've gone. 
ANOTHER FBI GUY Hey chief, look at this! 
The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine, revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is sickened to the core. 
FBI CHIEF Is nothing sacred? 
Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream. They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see. 
FBI CHIEF Oh, my Lord! 
RICK No! It can't be! 
We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of the dunk tank. The blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us. They turn around and...my God it's... it's.... 
REGIS AND KATHIE LEE! 
Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. Call him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice. 
ELIJUS Thought you killed me, huh? 
ELLY LEE What the hell are you looking at? 
FBI CHIEF Two pieces of deadmeat! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The FBI guys open fire. We show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. REGIS AND KATHIE LEE SET 
Rick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette. 
RICKY And that's my story. 
KATHIE LEE (YAWN) It was so exciting! 
REGIS And long! My God! It makes War and Peace sound like a warm up act! 
CREW GUY(O.S.) Okay! We got light! 
REGIS It's fixed? Well, it's about time! 
The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him. 
RICKY That's better. 
REGIS I'll say. (TO AUDIENCE) How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it for Ricky Coogan! 
The audience applauds and hoots wildly. 
KATHIE LEE Can we bring out the other freaks now? 
The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience. They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm, who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".

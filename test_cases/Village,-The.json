A grave has been dug, and a small, plain coffin, rests near it.  A man leans on the coffin, weeping a prayer. \nAugust Nicholson:  Who'll pinch me to wake me up?  Who will laugh at me when I fall?  Whose breath will I listen for, so that I may sleep?  Whose hand will I hold, so that I may walk? \nA small, plain headstone, reads \"Here Lies Daniel Nicholson, Beloved son of August Nicholson, June 17, 1890, October 3, 1897.\"  He was just seven years old. \nEdward Walker (off-screen):  We may question ourselves, at moments such as these.  Did we make the right decision to settle here? \nA banquet has been laid on polished wooden tables, outdoors.  The attendees are all dressed somberly.  Many women wear bonnets or hats.  Some of the men are bearded, and some are not.  Some have long hair, others, short hair.  All the women wear their hair tied back in some way.  The dress confirms that it is the late 1800's.  The surroundings reveal it to be a small village in a shallow valley, surrounded by forests.  Many houses are made of stone, some of wood.  The banquet includes bread, corn, greens, potatoes... a bounty from the recent harvest.  Edward Walker, unofficial town leader, stands, making a speech before the feast.  His hair is reddish, but going gray, and he wears a beard. August takes his hand. \nEdward Walker:  We are grateful for the time we have been given. \nHe sits, and the villagers begin to eat.  From the woods, a moaning sound, sorrowful.  The villagers quiet, and are still.  Noah Percy begins to laugh and clap and stands up.  He is perhaps twenty-five, but has the mind of a small child.  A young man seated next to him calms him down, and gets him to sit. \nTwo young girls use brushes to scrub the dishes in an outdoor trough, while an older sister uses a green hand-pump to get water from the underground well, so the dishes can be rinsed.  The younger girls giggle and splash each other. \nA woman in a gray skirt and a blue untucked blouse leads a flock of sheep into their barn. \nMen and women work side-by-side in a glass greenhouse, cultivating lettuce, rhubarb, and other foods for the winter. The ladies wear simple print dresses, with some petticoats underneath, and back-buttoned aprons over their dresses. The men wear pants, shirts, vests, and many wear hats.  This is a simple village of working people.  Fancy clothes are worn only at weddings and other celebrations. \nTwo sisters sweep the front porch of their simple home.  They wear plain boots, not fancy shoes.  They swirl their brooms around, light-hearted.  The older sister spots something at the edge of the porch and puts her broom down.  It is a red flower.  Making haste, they pluck the flower, take it some yards from their home, and bury it.  They return to their chores, but are subdued.  The color of the flower, red, has spooked them, for it is the bad color. \n", "test1_true": "At a creek in the woods, a reflection off the water shows a swaying, red-cloaked figure walking ponderously by. \nIt is morning.  Edward Walker, the school-teacher, approaches a group of children outside the schoolhouse.  They are gathered in a circle around something. \nEdward:  What manner of spectacle has attracted your attention so splendidly?  I ought to carry it in my pocket to help me teach. \nHe stands at the edge of the group and looks down.  Flies are buzzing. \nEdward:  Who came upon this?  Philip, did you move this? \nPhilip:  No, Mr. Walker. \nThe flies buzz louder and louder.  We see what they are looking at.  It is a small animal, probably a fox.  It has been killed and skinned, but the meat is still on its bones. \nInside the class, a girl in a light blue dress and pigtails speaks. \nGirl:  I inspected it carefully.  Its head was twisted back, and much of its fur removed. \nEdward:  I see. \nBoy:  It was murdered. \nEdward:  But who is the culprit?  Who has done this heinous act? \nThe girl who spoke before hesitates, but she decides to voice what is in all their minds. \nGirl:  Those We Don't Speak Of killed it. \n", "test1_id": 1155, "test2_input": "Christop:  She's not going to squeeze my shirt like that, is she? \nKitty looks at him with reproach, and then both smile, to put on a good face for their neighbors. \nA line of people have formed to congratulate Edward and Tabitha.  Victor leaves the line, and Alice Hunt enters it, facing Edward. \nAlice:  Many blessings on this most joyous of days. \nEdward:  It was a rare and lovely ceremony, was it not? \nAlice:  Glorious.  I saw your hand move to your eyes on more than one occasion. \nEdward (sheepish):  It must have been dust of some matter. \nShe holds out her hand, but he does not take it.  She balls it into a fist, smiles, and moves on.  When she turns back, Edward is clasping Mrs. Percy's hand and arm and talking with her.  She gives a startled smile, but seems pleased. \nThe young people, and some of the older ones, are dancing in rings around each other.  Kitty grabs Ivy and pulls her in to dance, weaving her in and out.  Everyone is laughing and enjoying themselves.  A more complicated dance begins, with several circles of people, and people ducking in and out.  A woman plays a complicated tune on the piano.  Ivy, with her sensitive hearing, hears what others cannot:  Two children screaming for Mr. Walker outside.  Eventually the rest of the villagers hear it, too.  Ivy holds out her arm and makes her way for the end of the greenhouse.  Everything is in confusion, but Lucius's arm reaches up and he grabs Ivy's hand, leading her the rest of the way.  Everyone gathers around Mr. Walker, and two young boys, about seven and nine years old. \nEdward (gravely; gently):  Speak up. \nOlder boy:  They're in the village.  They left more warnings. \nThere is shock all around. \nYounger boy:  They wish us to leave. \nEdward (despairing):  That cannot be. \n", "test2_true": "Edward:  You are certain? \nThey nod. \nEdward:  Can you boys stay close to Ivy, here?  She'll tell you some funny stories and have you laughing soon. \nIvy reaches out her hands to the boys, smiling reassuringly, but as soon as they have turned to face Mr. Walker, her face becomes serious, and she clutches them in her arms. \nEdward:  We will go together. \nThey set out in a double line, some carrying lanterns.  As they reach the houses, people branch off to enter their homes.  They slow down.  On the ground are many, many animal corpses, skinned and broken like the first.  Some are strung up in doorways.  It is horrific.  Christop ushers his new wife away from them, breaking their terrible, hypnotic spell. \nEdward and Alice stand outside the barn.  Alice is what we would call \"freaked out.\"  Edward is calmer, but still concerned. \nAlice (whispering):  Livestock has been taken, and skinned.  The hides and feathers are missing.  There are marks on the door where it was opened.  The marks are high.  Coyotes cannot reach that height. \nEdward holds up his hand where the marks are on the barn door.  They are man-height.  Only a creature could have done this. \nTwo men stand guard at each watchtower.  The party decorations are dangling askew.  The candle-lanterns are still lit. \nIn the middle of the night, Ivy lays in bed with her eyes open.  She is unused to sleeping in Kitty's bed.  Suddenly she sits up in bed, gasping.  She walks out on the porch, using memory and touch to guide her to where Lucius is sitting.  She sits down next to him.  They are perhaps four inches apart.  They speak in low voices, so as not to wake Ivy's family. \nIvy:  The elders are going to have an inquiry tomorrow.  Each member of the village is to be questioned in the meeting hall. \nLucius:  To see how the border was breached? \nIvy:  Yes. \n", "test2_id": 1156, "test3_input": "Edward:  We created those sounds. \nIvy:  The Ceremony of Meat? \nEdward:  We remove it ourselves.  An elder is always assigned. \nIvy is beginning to get angry. \nIvy:  The drills... they are farce, too? \nEdward:  We did not want anyone to go to the towns, Ivy. \nIvy:  What about the animals.... the skinned ones?  Are the elders responsible for that, too? \nEdward:  I BELIEVE ONE of the elders is responsible.  It will not happen again.  There is no one in this village who has not lost someone irreplaceable, who has nt felt loss so deeply that they questioned the very merit of living at all. \nThis strikes a chord with Ivy; it is exactly what she is going through. \nEdward:  It is a darkness I wished... you would never know. \nHe is distraught. \nEdward:  Forgive us our silly lies, Ivy.  They were not meant to harm. \nEdward holds her.  She seems to come to a decision. \nIvy:  I am... sad for you, Papa.  For all the elders. \n", "test3_true": "Edward:  On this paper has been written a tool of medicine.  It is common in the towns.  You will go... with two escorts.  Follow the sounds of a stream.  A half-day's journey will bring you to a hidden road.  At this hidden road, the two escorts will wait as you continue.  You alone will follow the road... and leave Covington Woods.  You are to tell no one in the towns where we are... and return with haste.  I cannot come with you.  You gave your heart to this boy.  He is in need.  Are you ready to take this burden, which by right, is yours and yours alone? \nEdward approaches the home of Alice Hunt.  She is boiling strips of cloth to use as bandages.  He comes in.  She looks at him. \nAlice:  I am making fresh clothes for Lucius.  He needs them. \nEdward:  Alice, I've sent for help. \nAlice turns to him, hopeful. \nEdward:  I've sent Ivy to the towns. \nAlice:  You cannot... \nEdward:  It is all that I can give you.  It is all that I can give you. \nAlice:  I accept. \nHe has stepped closer to her.  She makes to kiss him, but he turns his face.  She makes to put her head on his shoulder, but he leaves.  He understands the feeling that exists between them, but at the same time, without words, he is telling her that the feeling cannot be given voice or motion. \nBack with the elders behind the building.  They are still in shock from this news. \nMrs. Clack:  What have you done? \nEdward:  He is the victim of a crime. \nMrs. Clack:  We have agreed NEVER to go back, NEVER. \n", "test3_id": 1157}

KALOLO FANALUA We're from Guam, bitch! Now get outta the car! 
VICK Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut   and 
FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE! The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement... 
EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS 
Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out. 
ALAN Why'd you do that?! 
VICK 
(INCREDULOUS) Really? 
STU Maybe they just wanted to talk! 
VICK I honestly don't know how you two are still alive. 
ALAN Do you think we stole something from them last night?! 
STU Oh my god I am such a bad dad! 
ALAN (producing cellphone) I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control-- 
VICK No! No cops! 
ALAN "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty Cent?! 
STU Yeah, Vick, what's going on? 
VICK Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing! 
ALAN Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza! 
VICK Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip. 
ALAN They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too! 
STU If anything ever happened to my family, Vick... 
VICK Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM" 
INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY 
The boys hurry into their room, stressed. 
VICK Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone. 
ALAN No messages. 
STU Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms... 
INT. BEDROOM 
Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes, looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on the ground. Picks it up. 
STU Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom. 
VICK (O.S.) Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes. 
STU Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.

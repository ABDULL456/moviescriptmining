INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY 
Chris yanks the door open in time to hear... 
WADE ... those McCormicks are just plain-old dumb. 
Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back. 
CHRIS I've warned you not to talk about my family! 
HARLAN We have a surprise guest in the studio. 
Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the wall. 
CHRIS My family built this town! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WADE Am I supposed to be grateful? 
Chris draws back his fist for another shot.       Sam runs in and grabs him from behind. 
SAM That's enough! 
CHRIS Stay out of this, Sam! 
She manhandles Chris toward the door. 
EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY 
Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close behind. 
CHRIS Did you hear what he said? 
SAM I heard. 
WADE I want him locked up! 
SAM Let's all calm down. 
Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience. 
WADE We have no economy! People are barely scraping by! And now we've been offered the deal of a lifetime. You don't have the right to stand in our way! 
CHRIS Those mines are full of gas. One spark in the wrong place could blow this entire valley sky high. Do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste? 
WADE Chem-Tech did seismic analysis, vapor checks, groundwater reads, soil sampling. They found isolated methane pockets, but no benzene or hydrogen sulfide. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHRIS How could they run tests? I didn't give them permission to go into the mines. 
Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer. 
CHRIS I asked you a question, you greedy son of a bitch! 
WADE I'm greedy?! You're the one keeping us down so you can search for gold! 
Chris tries to go after Wade.       Sam holds him back. 
SAM Don't take another step. 
Chris stares at her. 
CHRIS You're taking his side? 
SAM I'm trying to keep the peace. 
WADE You're crazy!    Just like your father! 
Wade drives off in his humvee.       The crowd begins to disperse. 
CHRIS (sotto) He wasn't crazy. 
SAM It's okay. 
Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her mom.

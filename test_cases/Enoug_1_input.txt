"ERIN" We can't afford to eat out every night. I can cook, Tootster. "Queen E." rolls her eyes as: 
BRAD Hi. (off her blank look) I'm Brad Zall, I just rented a car from you guys. "Erin" stares at him. An insane moment of sustained paranoia. Who is this guy,. really? What does he want? Finally she realizes a normal response is required. Kind of a 
TRICK QUESTION: 
"ERIN" Is the vehicle all right? 
BRAD Yeah, it's fine. I was just thinking that if you're not doing anything, maybe I could buy you - and the kid of course - 
"ERIN" Who are you?! Who sent you?! You want a date?! You are totally out of your mind if you think I'm gonna have even this conversation we're having right now! I'm not, okay?! We are not talking! Get it?! 
BRAD Yeah, I get it. And good luck with your psychotherapy. He walks away. She stares after him. Again "Queen E." is looking at her mother in astonishment. 
SUP 
"ERIN" 
(STILL AGGRESSIVE) What? You're thinking I over- reacted? Huh? Just a little? 
CUT TO: 
INT. "ERIN'S" TAURUS. DAY. 
"Erin" driving too fast. Her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene. She's also eating doughnuts, sharing a box with her daughter. They pass a gas station. "Queen E." sees pay phones. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" You know Mom? I like the doughnuts and all, but the driving... 
"ERIN" Don't get on my case. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Every Sunday, to drive for 55 hours? In exasperation, "Erin" gestures with both hands - taking them off the wheel. Nothing bad happens, but again her recklessness makes us nervous - 
"ERIN" It's not 55 - 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Just to reach some phone booth?! Hey can I call Daddy this time?! Please??? Please please please... "Erin" shakes her head. "Queen E." gives her a mournful look. 
"ERIN" Don't beg. You look like a dog. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY. 
"Erin" is on the phone, "Queen E." at her side. 
"ERIN" Mrs. Tyler? It's Slim. 
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE Oh thank God. Listen. Mitch is planning some legal action, you're depriving him of his rights as a father, some nonsense like that: you better have Gracie call him. 
"ERIN" Oh that's good news - 
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE I thought you'd want to know - 
"ERIN" I do, thanks, I appreciate it. Listen: we have to keep it short again or he might trace it, so I better put her on - (hands phone to:) 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Hi Grandma! I have a new name! (as "Erin" frowns...) Yeah! You wanna hear it? "Erin" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters: 
"ERIN" Sorry, your Majesty. Remember: names're secret. "Queen E." nods. Puts on her mournful look... 
"ERIN" That is the most pitiful expression I've ever seen. 
CLOSE ON "QUEEN ELIZABETH" She listens, cradling the phone. "Erin" watches her daughter's face light up: 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Hi Daddy! We're having a great vacation!

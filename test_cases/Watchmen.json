In his younger days, he was a supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news clipping in Blake's closet. \nINT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMoloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops, staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up-- in spiky handwriting it reads: \"LOOK BEHIND YOU.\" Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his back and SLAMS him to the floor. \nRORSCHACH Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch. \nMOLOCH What are you talking about? I'm a retired business maaAAAHHH! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach TWISTS the man's arm back viciously. \nRORSCHACH Lie again, I'll break your arm. \nMOLOCH Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him. \nRORSCHACH You attended a funeral today. Why? \nMOLOCH The funeral? I don't know why I went. I just felt I should. I'd been thinking about the Comedian-- Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall. \nRORSCHACH How did you know Blake was the Comedian? \nMOLOCH He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his mask off. He was drunk-- \nRORSCHACH You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you? \nMOLOCH I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was! He was upset! Crying! \nRORSCHACH The Comedian? Crying? \nMOLOCH He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was pissing in my pants--I thought he was going to kill me! \nRORSCHACH What did he say?! \nMOLOCH He said he was wrong. About it all being a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He said he was scared-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRORSCHACH Scared of what?! \nMOLOCH Something he saw, I think. He said something about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left! Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him. \nRORSCHACH Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from \"Pyramid Industries.\" \nMOLOCH So that's it? I'm clean? \nRORSCHACH Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs. \nMOLOCH Illegal--I don't use drugs. Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat. \nRORSCHACH Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal. \nMOLOCH oh c-come on. Look, please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything . I have cancer. \nRORSCHACH What kind of cancer? \nMOLOCH The kind you don't get better from. \nRORSCHACH Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: Rorschach blasting through the night air as the city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) Rorschach's Journal, October 17th. Thought about Moloch's story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars. CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) But if it's true, then what? What could have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about? What was it that he saw? So many questions. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nRorschach stands alone over Blake's fresh grave. Paying his proper respects. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944, buried in the rain. Murdered.

No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the photo of the new Watchmen. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Blake saw the true face of human kind and chose to become a parody of it, treated it like a joke. FLASHES OF: Blake being beaten in his apartment. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) I heard a joke once. Man goes to a doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Blake is KICKED in the stomach. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Doctor says, \"the treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.\" Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) The man bursts into tears. A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) \"But doctor,\" he says. ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window. \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) \"I am Pagliacci.\" Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Good joke. Everybody laugh. Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK . \nINT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON \nCLOSE ON: Laurie, eyes closed with pleasure, as Dr. Manhattan's GLOWING BLUE HANDS caress her face. \nLAURIE Mmm. What time do you have to be at your TV interview? \nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) Don't worry, we have plenty of time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Eyes still closed, she does not see a THIRD BLUE HAND trace a line down her cheek. She kisses it. \nLAURIE Hey, your finger, it's like licking a battery. It's all-- She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it! Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused. \nDR. MANHATTAN 1 DR. MANHATTAN 2 Please don't be upset. I thought you'd enjoy it. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I--You startled me, that's all \nDR. MANHATTAN 1 I don't know what stimulates you anymore. Laurie backs into the hall, trying to get a grip. \nLAURIE Forget about it. I overreacted. It was just strange to see-- Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) How long have you been working in here? \nDR. MANHATTAN 1 Laurie, try to understand-- \nLAURIE Understand!? You're working in here at the same time we're in bed!? \nDR. MANHATTAN 3 My work with Adrian is at an important stage. It seemed unnecessary to-- \nLAURIE Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH HIM and SMASHES IN THE KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDR. MANHATTAN 3 Laurie, please--If you think there's a problem with my attitude, I'm prepared to discuss it-- As he speaks, the smashed BEAKER and its contents RISE INTO THE AIR, REASSEMBLING perfectly in the palm of 3's hand. IN THE HALL: Laurie nearly bumps into Dr. Manhattan 2. \nDR. MANHATTAN 2 --but logically, not clouded with human emotion. \nLAURIE Human emotion? You were human once. That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten that. \nDR. MANHATTAN 2 Laurie, where are you-- The door slams. Laurie's left. For good. Dr. Manhattan 2 stands there. He walks back to the BEDROOM where 1 is. Dr. Manhattan 1 holds an OLD PHOTO. In the photo is a COUPLE, smiling into the camera. We recognize the woman as Janey Slater, Dr. Manhattan's ex-girlfriend, who we saw in Adrian's flashback at Blake's funeral. We recognize the man in the photo as . Dr. Manhattan. When he was human. Dr. Manhattan stares at the photo. Perhaps feeling the tingle of human emotion again \nINT. DAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING \nDan heats up some leftover Chinese food in the microwave as the TV plays in the B/G: \nNEWS ANALYST (V.O.) --no one's fired their weapons yet, but no one's lowered them either. Maybe these other countries aren't so afraid of Dr. Manhattan, maybe they're calling the President's bluff. I'm very curious to see what Dr. Manhattan himself has to say in his live interview which should be in about an hour or so BOOM, BOOM! Dan looks up. Someone's banging on the door. Hard. \nINT.

Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him \n(BEAT) What about you? What are you going to do? \nLAURIE I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me. \nDAN Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place? \nLAURIE Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose-- \nDAN It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening \nLAURIE You're buying into Rorschach's \"mask killer\" theory? \nDAN I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles. \nLAURIE Okay. \n(BEAT) So this guy who tried to kill Adrian--who was he? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nDAN (V.0.) Some local low-life named Roy Chess \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy. Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards-- --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a security guard . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries. Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries. Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE \nDIRECTORY. Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types in a name: \"Jane Slater.\" A photo of Janey Slater pops up--\"Status: RETIRED.\" Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nWe're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his mask on. \nRORSCHACH (V.O.) Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: \"Tonight 11:30, M.\" \nRORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Still in his POV, we watch him put each article on. Then he pulls out his MASK. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) . my face.

Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him. \nRORSCHACH Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE. \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead. Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one that reads: \"LOOK BEHIND YOU.\" Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW. \nDET. FINE (O.S.)

FINE (O.S.) \nLET'S MAKE THIS A NICE, CLEAN SURRENDER. \nRORSCHACH Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER. \nDET. FINE (O.S.) \nALRIGHT.

From the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, snarling like a rabid dog, landing hard on the concrete. His ankle TWISTS, dropping him to the ground. Rorschach struggles to get to his feet. When he looks up he finds TWENTY COPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE before him. A loaded, pregnant pause. The COPS RUSH FORWARD. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: But Rorschach holds up a gloved hand. And they all stop, unsure what this lunatic will do next. \nRORSCHACH Ten years. I've waited for this.

I'm still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead. \nLAURIE Static? \nDR. MANHATTAN Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare occurrence. The detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be the cause. \nLAURIE Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will die! \nDR. MANHATTAN And the universe will not even notice. See the dual moons. Aren't they breathtaking? Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED, the smaller is a delicate SHELL PINK. Spectacular. \nLAURIE You're right, Jon--what does human life matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm not going to debate you when you clearly don't see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess quantum physics doesn't allow for miracles. \nDR. MANHATTAN No, thermodynamic miracles are-- \nLAURIE Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now. \nDR. MANHATTAN On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish.

I have longed to witness such a thing and yet I neglect that in human coupling, millions upon millions of cells compete to create life over generation after generation: Until finally, your mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the Comedian--a man she has every reason to hate. And out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from all of that chaos; Your creation is like . turning air into gold.

Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he struck North for Gordium, where the world's greatest puzzle waited. A great knot, impossible to untie. For a young man determined to rule the world, it was a challenge he couldn't resist. So he sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral thinking, you see. Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) What is it, girl? He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward Karnak. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Ah.

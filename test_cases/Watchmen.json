{"train": "WATCHMEN \nWritten by \nDavid Hayter & Alex Tse \nINT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING \nCLOSE ON: A \"Have A Nice Day\" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING. We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face. Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup . \nINT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nThe apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news: \nANCHORWOMAN --addressing the United Nations today, the President expressed his concern over the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East. CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES-- \nPRESIDENT The sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end. Armed conflict is not self contained in its respective region--the consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs. CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman-- \nANCHORWOMAN While the President's position was clear, he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate. CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads straight for him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face. With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr. Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed-- --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel-- CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake jumps up, immediately at the ready-- --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake. \nBLAKE Just a matter of time, I suppose. With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes, but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out of Blake's hand-- --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to the head. Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in the eye . and starts laughing. Hysterical. \nBLAKE (CONT'D) I always thought I knew the punchline. But I guess the joke's on me now. He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment-- --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a sound as he plummets to the sidewalk. \nEXT. STREET - EVENING \nCLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood DRIPS on it . when the pin is WASHED AWAY. \nEXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT) \nA SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper. \nCOP 1 Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene! \nSHOPKEEPER It's been over four hours, I got a business to run-- As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as the water carries it to a DRAIN-- --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it. We never see his face. We move from his POV-- --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG. Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse the magazines and periodicals, most of which have inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads \"War?\", The New York Times: \"China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese Waters,\" The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President with Dr. Manhattan: \"What Me Worry?\" The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers. \nNEWS VENDOR (re: headlines) Depressing ain't it? \nMAN But good for business, right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNEWS VENDOR Yeah. Irony's a bitch. The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the News Vendor on the shoulder. \nHOMELESS MAN The current issue of The New Frontiersman, where is it? \nNEWS VENDOR It's late this month. \nHOMELESS MAN When will it be here? \nNEWS VENDOR I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late-- We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW-- \nINT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n--inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded) and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window. \nDET. FINE Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225. A solid 225, guy was built like a linebacker. This is plate glass too, you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this. Had to be a two man job. At least. You check the bedroom? \nDET. GALLAGHER Drawers were open, tossed through. Mattress flipped. \nDET. FINE Robbery? \nDET. GALLAGHER Or made to look like one. (tosses Fine an ID) Found that in the bedroom. Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It reads \"Special Advisor, United States.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D) You see this? He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine. \nDET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D) Shaking hands with the President. \nANCHORWOMAN This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on screen. \nHOLLIS Well, forced all of you guys out except one. \n(BEAT) Next week? Dan nods, then leaves. \nEXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING \nDan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment reads: \"MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!\" \nINT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING \nDan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him. ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far. \nGANG LEADER Move your leg. \nDAN What? \nGANG LEADER I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass. \nEXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING \nDan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert. His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED. There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house. \nINT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS. \nINT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nDan enters the kitchen, stunned to find-- \nDAN Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN \nOF BEANS. \nRORSCHACH Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind? \nDAN No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you? \nRORSCHACH No need. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time, Dan is wary. \nDAN You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop. \nRORSCHACH Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization. \nDAN Other than that . How have you been keeping? \nRORSCHACH Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH. \nDAN This little stain, is that bean juice or-- \nRORSCHACH Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead. \nDAN The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN (cont'd) Let's talk downstairs. \nINT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING \nRorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall. Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark. \nINT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship. \nDAN How did it happen? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRORSCHACH Murder. Someone threw him out a window. \nDAN Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was. \nDOUG ROTH If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, I'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan. \nADRIAN Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- (reaching Dan) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nADRIAN (CONT'D) --but I talk too much. Will you mind pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A good friend of mine is here. Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat. \nDAN You look good, Adrian. \nADRIAN Dan--it's been far too long. \nINT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER \nDan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias). \nADRIAN Rorschach. He paid me a visit too. \nDAN He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out. \nADRIAN \n(LAUGHS) Sara can be tough. Is that why you came to see me? You're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach's conjured up? \nDAN You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me. \nADRIAN Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors. Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) No, there are other things in the world I'm far more concerned about. ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI SOLDIERS on patrol. \nEXT. PAKISTAN/INDIA BORDER (KASHMIR) - SAME TIME \nWe're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the mountains. (They speak in Baluchi) \nPAKISTANI SOLDIER We should attack the Indian bastards. I don't understand-- CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani soldier. \nINDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.) --why I can't just pull this trigger. We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi) \nINDIAN SOLDIER #2 Because then a battle begins. Then a war. And then the Americans will send-- \nINT. BRIDGE - BATTLESHIP - CHINESE WATERS - SAME TIME \nCHINESE CAPTAIN (in Mandarin) --their blue abomination to intervene. And we don't want that. At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies. We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance. \nINT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - ISRAEL - SAME TIME \nWe're in the control room as an ISRAELI OFFICER and his much younger AIDE watch SATELLITE IMAGES on the giant screen. Images of potential targets. (They speak in Hebrew) \nAIDE Is Dr. Manhattan even real? \nISRAELI OFFICER Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that. \nEXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING \nA SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the gate. We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The guard has no reaction to Rorschach-- --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The Guard waves him through. \nINT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING \nRorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask on. He quietly enters-- \nINT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS \n--a huge room, which contains technologically advanced MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE-- \nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air-- not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming. \nRORSCHACH Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end. \nLAURIE Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man. \nRORSCHACH Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre. \nLAURIE Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it. \nLAURIE More war talk. I can't deal with this. I don't want to think about the future right now. \nDR. MANHATTAN There's no such thing as the \"future.\" I've explained to you on many occasions-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAURIE --that time is simultaneous. There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I know. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry, it's just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future, or whatever you call it. \nDR. MANHATTAN I understand your frustration, Laurie. The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame. Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head-- \nINT. JUPITER HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 25 YEARS AGO) \nLaurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little girl. There's arguing downstairs. Laurie goes down to investigate. She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her PARENTS inside, arguing-- \nLAURIE (V.0.) Jon, stop! \nINT. LABORATORY - EVENING \nBack in the present, Laurie pulls away from Dr. Manhattan's touch. That memory seems to be painful for her. \nDR. MANHATTAN I didn't mean to upset you. \nLAURIE I know. I think I've been cooped up on this base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen him in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he's available for dinner tonight. \nDR. MANHATTAN You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further investigate this interference with my vision. I find it troubling. \nINT. RECEPTION - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING \nLaurie, dressed up and looking gorgeous, heads out when she's stopped by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT FORBES. \nAGENT FORBES Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter? \nLAURIE Out. \nAGENT FORBES I'll have a car brought around in a few minutes. \nLAURIE No, thank you. I called a cab already-- it's waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of her. \nAGENT FORBES You look quite nice. Who are you meeting? \nLAURIE An old friend of mine. And of Dr. Manhattan's. Now step out of my way. \nAGENT FORBES Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that your boyfriend is this country's most valuable asset. You need to keep him happy. And on our side. Laurie glares at him. \nLAURIE Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she leaves. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT \nWe move down the beautifully lit New York city skyline, passing the Brooklyn Bridge . the Statue of Liberty and the in Towers of the World Trade Center? We hear the LAUGHTER-- \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \n--of Dan and Laurie as they finish up their meal at this trendy restaurant. \nLAURIE You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time? \nDAN Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, \"punish me! punish me!\" \nLAURIE \n(LAUGHS) Whatever happened to him? \nDAN Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter. \nLAURIE Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's smitten with her and that he probably has been for years. Laurie seems oblivious. \nDAN It's great seeing you again, Laurie. \nLAURIE Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it. \nDAN You sure I can't get that? \nLAURIE Let me put my expense account to use. You can thank Uncle Sam. \nSALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D) Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor Eddie. \nLAURIE Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what he-- \nSALLY Laurie, you're still young. You don't understand how things change as time goes by. FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan and Dr. Manhattan. \nLAURIE (V.0.) Another lesson on time passing. Y'know, you and Jon should get together and write a book on the subject. Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSALLY That leaves just two of the old team left. Me and Hollis Mason. She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him. \nEXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON \nSALLY (V.O.) Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought he'd get the last laugh. As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of mourners, stopping at Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully into Blake's \nGRAVE \nINT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK - 1964) \nMATCH CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan. In the night sky, a BURST of FIREWORKS. Outside, a CROWD of Vietnamese people CHEER. \nBLAKE (O.S.) Fireworks. A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His face is devoid of his trademark scar. \nBLAKE (CONT'D) You'd think this country'd had enough goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this war, I think it might have driven us crazy, y'know? As a country. But we didn't. Thanks to you. \nDR. MANHATTAN You sound bitter. \nBLAKE Me? I think it's hilarious. \nVIETNAMESE GIRL (O.S.) Mr. Eddie? They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door. She's pregnant, just starting to show. \nBLAKE Fantastic. Just what I need. \nVIETNAMESE GIRL The war is over now. We must talk. (touching her abdomen) About this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at her, drunk and dangerous. \nBLAKE There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your horrible, sweaty little country. He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred. \nVIETNAMESE GIRL No. You will remember. You will remember me and my country forever. She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar \nBLAKE You bitch! My face! He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL-- \nDR. MANHATTAN Blake . don't. BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall. She drops, dead. \nDR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her down. Blake turns on him, spitting fury. \nBLAKE That's right! And you know what? You watched me! You could've changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury or the bottle into snowflakes, but you didn't, did you? You're drifting outta touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me the war got to you. Blake walks off shouting \"Medic!\" Dr. Manhattan turns to the girl's body and regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - EARLY EVENING \nDr. Manhattan looking down at Blake's grave. We move down to \nADRIAN \nINT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK 15 YEARS AGO) \nBLAKE (V.0.) This is all bullshit. Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the meeting of the \"new\" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr. Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays Laurie attention, but she is oblivious. A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting. \nADRIAN What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table, a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: \"Arab Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan.\"' \nBLAKE What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn't work twenty years ago, and it ain't gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians. \nDAN Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp. \nRORSCHACH That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic. \nADRIAN Bureaucracies can be effective with the right leadership-- \nBLAKE And that would be you, right Veidt? I mean you're the \"smartest guy in the world,\" right? \nADRIAN It doesn't take a genius to see that the world has problems. \nThe Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered. He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news clipping in Blake's closet. \nINT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMoloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops, staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up-- in spiky handwriting it reads: \"LOOK BEHIND YOU.\" Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his back and SLAMS him to the floor. \nRORSCHACH Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch. \nMOLOCH What are you talking about? I'm a retired business maaAAAHHH! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach TWISTS the man's arm back viciously. \nRORSCHACH Lie again, I'll break your arm. \nMOLOCH Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him. \nRORSCHACH You attended a funeral today. Why? \nMOLOCH The funeral? I don't know why I went. I just felt I should. I'd been thinking about the Comedian-- Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall. \nRORSCHACH How did you know Blake was the Comedian? \nMOLOCH He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his mask off. He was drunk-- \nRORSCHACH You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you? \nMOLOCH I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was! He was upset! Crying! \nRORSCHACH The Comedian? Crying? \nMOLOCH He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was pissing in my pants--I thought he was going to kill me! \nRORSCHACH What did he say?! \nMOLOCH He said he was wrong. About it all being a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He said he was scared-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRORSCHACH Scared of what?! \nMOLOCH Something he saw, I think. He said something about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left! Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him. \nRORSCHACH Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from \"Pyramid Industries.\" \nMOLOCH So that's it? I'm clean? \nRORSCHACH Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs. \nMOLOCH Illegal--I don't use drugs. Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat. \nRORSCHACH Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal. \nMOLOCH oh c-come on. Look, please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything . I have cancer. \nRORSCHACH What kind of cancer? \nMOLOCH The kind you don't get better from. \nRORSCHACH Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: Rorschach blasting through the night air as the city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) Rorschach's Journal, October 17th. Thought about Moloch's story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars. CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) But if it's true, then what? What could have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about? What was it that he saw? So many questions. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nRorschach stands alone over Blake's fresh grave. Paying his proper respects. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944, buried in the rain. Murdered. FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door is kicked in. \nDAN Who is it? \nLAURIE (O.S.) It's Laurie. \nDAN Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door. \nDAN (CONT'D) Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a little sticky-- \nLAURIE I left Jon. \nINT. DAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDan pours a teary eyed Laurie a glass of RED WINE. \nDAN Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here? \nLAURIE I lost them in the subways. I think. \nDAN I'm really sorry, Laurie. \nLAURIE Living with him . Dan, you don't know what it's been like. INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring. \nLAURIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) The way he looks at things, like he can't remember what they are, like he doesn't really care. This world, the real world to him it's like walking through mist, and all the people are just shadows. Shadows in the fog. Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating before him-- waiting for its wearer. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nDan and Laurie walk the streets, getting some air. \nLAURIE I hope I didn't ruin your night. \nDAN Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man is arguing with the News Vendor: \nNEWS VENDOR --I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much? Cuz those bastards don't give a damn about you, pal! They--hold up, here it comes. They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a BUNDLE of the latest issue of \"The New Frontiersman.\" CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty, floating suit. His TIE knots itself. Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again, he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then \nDISAPPEARS IN A BURST OF PARTICLES. \nEXT. STREET - SAME TIME \nDan and Laurie turn down a darker, less populated street. \nDAN Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following. \nLAURIE I know. I just find it rude when people show up at your door-- \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT \nThe main waiting area. People go about their jobs. The RECEPTIONIST hears a strange, electric CRACKLING \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAURIE (V.0.) --completely out of the blue. Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The receptionist SHRIEKS. The PRODUCER looks out his office. \nPRODUCER Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me? \nRECEPTIONIST He, he just-- \nPRODUCER All geez. We don't have time for make-up. That blue is too light for television. The light from Dr. Manhattan's SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE. \nDR. MANHATTAN Is this dark enough? \nPRODUCER Uh, yeah \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME \nDan and Laurie turn down an alley. We now see who's following them--a group of YOUNG THUGS. \nPRODUCER (V.0.) that's dark enough. \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - BACK STAGE - SAME TIME \nA White House PRESS AGENT escorts Dr. Manhattan to the set. \nPRESS AGENT Just another reminder that if the second Geneva Convention comes up, our official position is that talks will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda. The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the cards. Please keep that in mind. Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up and we're live with the glossy NEWS HOST. \n(CONTINUED) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nADRIAN Everyone back off! Don't you understand? He's the only thing preventing the world from chaos! \nDOUG ROTH How many other people did you do this to? Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS-- \nDR. MANHATTAN I said LEAVE ME ALONE! Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr. Manhattan is suddenly alone. He looks stunned almost. \nEXT. ROOF - SAME TIME \nThe TV audience materializes out on the roof \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nDan and Laurie exit the quiet alley, trying to play it off. \nLAURIE I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us getting mugged. \nDAN Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline. \nLAURIE No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for one night. (walking away) You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous world out there. \nINT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHollis opens the door for Dan-- \nHOLLIS You're late. \nDAN I know, you won't believe it-- \nHOLLIS You missed it--Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDAN Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof. \nDAN (CONT'D) I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know. \nHOLLIS She'll know soon enough. The whole world will know. \nINT. CAB (MOVING) - NIGHT \nLaurie rides in back, staring out at the street, calming down. The cab stops at a red light; The CABBIE takes outa ZIPPO,lights a cigarette. Laurie stares at the FLAME \nINT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO) \nlike she stares at the flame here, as Adrian's display burns. Laurie glances around as everyone leaves, apologizing to Adrian. \nEXT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO) \nOutside Watchmen HQ, Dan's Owl Ship rises out of view. Rorschach skulks off into the shadows. Dr. Manhattan and Janey Slater get into a Town Car as young Laurie watches from around the corner. \nBLAKE (O.S.) Laurel? Laurel Jane? Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows. \nBLAKE (CONT'D) You're Sally Jupiter's kid. \nLAURIE You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over. \nBLAKE You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny little mole. \nLAURIE Got another smoke? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAKE She was one of the all-time champion beauties, your mom. She talk about me much? \nLAURIE No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly. \nSALLY (O.S.) \nTAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER. Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches toward them from a LIMO, waiting at the sidewalk. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I want to know who's behind this! The Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him, unanswered. He looks over at Dan, frustrated. \nINT. CAFE - AFTERNOON \nDan and Laurie sit in the back of the cafe, making sure they have privacy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAURIE Oh my god. Where's Adrian now? \nDAN Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him \n(BEAT) What about you? What are you going to do? \nLAURIE I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me. \nDAN Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place? \nLAURIE Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose-- \nDAN It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening \nLAURIE You're buying into Rorschach's \"mask killer\" theory? \nDAN I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles. \nLAURIE Okay. \n(BEAT) So this guy who tried to kill Adrian--who was he? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nDAN (V.0.) Some local low-life named Roy Chess \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy. Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards-- --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a security guard . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries. Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries. Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE \nDIRECTORY. Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types in a name: \"Jane Slater.\" A photo of Janey Slater pops up--\"Status: RETIRED.\" Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nWe're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his mask on. \nRORSCHACH (V.O.) Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: \"Tonight 11:30, M.\" \nRORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Still in his POV, we watch him put each article on. Then he pulls out his MASK. \nRORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D) . my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN \nINT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S EYES staring fearfully out the rainy window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him. \nRORSCHACH Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE. \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead. Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one that reads: \"LOOK BEHIND YOU.\" Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW. \nDET. FINE (O.S.) (over LOUDSPEAKERS) \nRORSCHACH, THIS IS THE POLICE! \nRORSCHACH No. \nDET. FINE (O.S.) \nWE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. \n(CONTINUED) \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's house blazes in the background. \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) \nGIVE ME BACK MY FACE! \nINT. DAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nDan is at the front door, fixing the lock Rorschach busted twice, when Laurie comes down the stairs, yawning. \nLAURIE What time is it? \nDAN Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANCHORWOMAN Today, police searched the apartment of Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range. Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES. \nANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D) Inside the decrepit apartment, police discovered stacks of right-wing literature, including several years of back issues of the ultra-conservative publication, \"The New Frontiersman.\" We asked \"New Frontiersman\" editor, Hector Godfrey, for comment. CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We see Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background. \nEDITOR Rorschach is an American patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication. \nANCHORWOMAN During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers, shooting one officer with a grappling gun. That officer is in serious but stable condition. \nANCHORMAN Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues to intensify. Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question-- Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk. \nLAURIE That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains away. \nDAN He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLAURIE He shot a cop with a grappling gun. \nDAN Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary \nLAURIE And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon. \nDAN Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer. \nLAURIE Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation? \nDAN Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs. \nINT. PRISON HALLS - DAY \nRorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach stares ahead. Silent. Calm. \nINT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY \nThe PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE. \nPSYCHIATRIST Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter? \nRORSCHACH No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully. \nPSYCHIATRIST Let me explain your situation here, Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may be able to convince them that you should to be treated medically, in a hospital, which I believe is best for you. But the authorities want to put you in General Population. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRORSCHACH A prison is a prison. \nPSYCHIATRIST Yes, but the difference is, downstairs? They'll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD. \nPSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D) Now . . tell me what you see. FLASH OF: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible. \nRORSCHACH A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card. \nPSYCHIATRIST How about this one? What do you see here? FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER, HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the face. Shuts the door on him. \nRORSCHACH Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card. FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him \"son of a whore.\" Rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild animal--biting, clawing . \nPRISONER Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous, right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too. Maybe I can give you my autograph. The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK behind the counter to turn away-- --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER BASKET from its mount-- --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins, GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach. Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks, his icy voice carrying easily. \nRORSCHACH None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS \nRORSCHACH (CONT'D) You're locked up in here with me. \nINT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER -.EVENING \nCLOSE ON: THE NITE-OWL UNIFORM, staring its blank, empty stare. Laurie stares back, alone down here, fascinated with the costume, the gadgets, the whole place. She wanders to the OWL-SHIP, whose tarp has been pulled back. She runs her finger through the DUST caked on the windshield. \nINT. OWL-SHIP - EVENING \nInside the ship, Laurie pulls open a HATCH filled with ALTERNATE COSTUMES; designed for underwater work, cold conditions, heavy armor. She puts a cigarette in her mouth. \nLAURIE All these gadgets and there isn't even a dash lighter She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing \nHAPPENS \nINT. DAN'S KITCHEN - EVENING \nDan returns home with some TAKE OUT FOOD . . when he hears Laurie SCREAM downstairs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDAN Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind. \nINT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - EVENING \nDan descends the stairs and sees FIRE. \nDAN \nLAURIE! Dan grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. \nDAN (CONT'D) Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of the Owl-Ship. Dan's got the fire under control now. \nLAURIE I'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I was looking for the lighter in.there. \nDAN I don't smoke. Are you hurt? \nLAURIE I'm fine, but your ship-- \nDAN Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient. \nLAURIE Archie? \nDAN \n(EMBARRASSED) Short for Archimedes--Merlin's owl. I'm just glad you're okay. I heard you scream and well, you know, after the Comedian-- \nLAURIE Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach is insane. \nDAN Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the wall. Flicking them, the Owl-Chamber LIGHTS UP. Hidden FANS dissipate the smoke. \nLAURIE How did you ever afford all this? \nDAN My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me. \nLAURIE How did he die? \nDAN Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him for the first time. \nLAURIE You really do worry about me, don't you? \nDAN Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away. \nDAN (CONT'D) Sorry, I \nLAURIE It's so beautiful \nDAN Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING. \nDAN (CONT'D) Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new. \nLAURIE Look! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAURIE (CONT'D) There's children in there! \nDAN I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories. (over the LOUDSPEAKERS) \nPLEASE REMAIN CALM. WE ARE SLOWING THE \nFIRE DOWN FROM BELOW. CALMLY MAKE YOUR \nWAY TO THE ROOF AND I'LL EXTEND A RAMP TO \nYOU. (to Laurie) Can you escort the people over? She watches him move, quick, confident. She smiles. \nLAURIE I'm on it. Nite Owl. \nEXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe ship EXTENDS AN ESCAPE RAMP with Laurie on board. The residents forget their fear of fire for a moment as they soak in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this Owl-Ship. \nLAURIE Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll have you out of here in just a moment. ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD JAZZ plays pleasantly. \nINT. OWL-SHIP - NIGHT \nBelow, the residents file on board, in a daze at their surroundings. Laurie grins at the music. \nLAURIE Anybody want coffee? \nEXT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT \nFIRE rising behind, Dan wings the ship STRAIGHT INTO FRAME. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nThe Owl-Ship RISES, leaving a grateful CROWD behind. In the background FIRE TRUCKS are just arriving. A FIREFIGHTER looks up in time to see the Owl-Ship disappear into the clouds. \nINT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT \nDan skims the clouds like a man waking from a dream. \nLAURIE I can't believe we did that! That was actually fun \nDAN Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together. \nINT. OWL-SHIP - LATER \nSoft music plays. Dan and Laurie lie in a heap of discarded costumes. \nLAURIE It was good, wasn't it? \nDAN Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan grins, having fun with her. \nDAN (CONT'D) It--you were unbelievable. They kiss. \nLAURIE So . what do we do next? Dan sits up, serious. Very serious. \nDAN I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity. \n(BEAT) I think we should spring Rorschach. \nEXT. OWL-SHIP - CONTINUOUS \nLong beat. The ship hovers, silent in the clouds. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Dan notes TWO BLIPS on the RADAR. \nEXT. NEW YORK AIRSPACE - NIGHT \nTWO NYPD HELICOPTERS appear behind the Owl-Ship INSIDE THE OWL SHIP: Dan takes the controls. \nDAN Let's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE. \nEXT. MARS - NIGHT \nA red vista. Dr. Manhattan and Laurie appear atop a rise. \nDR. MANHATTAN So. What do you think? \nLAURIE J--huc? Hhhhhhh-- Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him. \nDR. MANHATTAN Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind. He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her. She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same time. \nLAURIE Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is (looking up) Oh shit. Laurie stands up before Jon's huge GLASS PALACE. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) I'm on Mars. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY AIRSPACE - NIGHT \nThe Owl-Ship WEAVES around the buildings, trying to shake the copters . but the pilots are good, staying on its tail. The Owl-Ship shoots out of the city over the water . Dan LOOPS Archie around-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: --and heads straight for a SUBWAY TUNNEL \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \n. just clearing it. The Owl-Ship SKIMS the sides of the tunnel, SPARKS flying-- --when a SUBWAY appears. They're heading straight for it. \nDAN oh no. \nRORSCHACH Tactical error, Daniel. \nDAN I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY AIRSPACE - NIGHT \nThe Owl-Ship emerges from the subway tunnel . when one of the NYPD copters cuts it off. \nDAN Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter's still there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled. \nEXT. EAST RIVER (UNDERWATER) - SAME TIME \nThe Owl-Ship rests at the bottom of the river, hidden \nEXT.

Some super owl dude broke Rorschach outta prison. \nGANG LEADER Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in a \nWHEELCHAIR \nGANG MEMBER 2 You say Nite Owl broke him out? Didn't he write a book or something? He lives over a garage near here. \nGANG LEADER Does he now \nINT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHollis sits up in bed, TV on: CNN; Grainy, shaky CLIPS of the Owl-Ship. He's on the phone, beaming. \nHOLLIS It's just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre back at it again. CUT TO: Sally Jupiter on the other end in California, watching the same footage. \nSALLY I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry for waking you, Hollis. \nLAURIE Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan? \nDR. MANHATTAN You mean you're sleeping with Dan Dreiberg? Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge. \nLAURIE But you already know . You said-- \nDR. MANHATTAN I said, often, that you were my only remaining link with the world. Now that link is shattered. Don't you see the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any stake in? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLAURIE That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship. \nDR. MANHATTAN Not to me. My red world here means more to me than your blue one. I'll show you around if you like. The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE. \nLAURIE Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes. \nDR. MANHATTAN Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR \nEXT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - NIGHT \nThe Owl-Ship approaches the large warehouse building that is Pyramid Industries. The ship lands in the alley nearby. Dan and Rorschach exit the ship. Shady neighborhood. Rorschach goes to the door which is AJAR \nINT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDan and Rorschach slowly make their way down, peering into ROOMS. The place looks abandoned--scattered papers, dusty file cabinets, leftover computer components \nRORSCHACH You sure this is the correct location, Daniel? \nDAN Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did. \nINT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT \nThey enter the large, dark industrial section of the building. They pass huge PROCESSING VATS, CONVEYOR BELTS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDAN I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away. \nRORSCHACH Daniel. \nDAN They're harmless, Rorschach. \nRORSCHACH Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth. \nDAN Hey, I know this man. \nRORSCHACH Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television. \nDAN No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him. \nRORSCHACH Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say. \nDAN Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian? \nRORSCHACH Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 2) \nDAN On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list. \nRORSCHACH That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life. \nDAN If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but-- \nRORSCHACH But why? \nDAN I don't know. Let's go ask him. \nEXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT \nThe endless white blanket that is Antarctica is interrupted by a SPLASH OF COLOR in the distance. As we approach, we see that the color is a BIO-DOME--a tropical RAINFOREST inside. This is part of KARNAK: Adrian Veidt's Arctic Fortress. \nLAURIE Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come back to Earth? \nDR. MANHATTAN I return to Earth at some point. The streets are filled with death. \nLAURIE You mean there's going to be a war? An actual, nuclear war? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDR. MANHATTAN I can't be sure. I'm still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead. \nLAURIE Static? \nDR. MANHATTAN Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare occurrence. The detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be the cause. \nLAURIE Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will die! \nDR. MANHATTAN And the universe will not even notice. See the dual moons. Aren't they breathtaking? Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED, the smaller is a delicate SHELL PINK. Spectacular. \nLAURIE You're right, Jon--what does human life matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm not going to debate you when you clearly don't see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess quantum physics doesn't allow for miracles. \nDR. MANHATTAN No, thermodynamic miracles are-- \nLAURIE Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now. \nDR. MANHATTAN On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish. The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs. \nLAURIE That's it then. You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans. And look, you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the house. Maybe you're wrong about everything. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Jon is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. \nDR. MANHATTAN Laurie. You complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms. And yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective. If only you'd try to see the whole continuum, life's pattern, you'd understand. But you deliberately shut it out as if afraid to see. \nLAURIE I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, do that thing you do. She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like earlier in the lab, Jon touches her head-- \nINT. JUPITER HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 25 YEARS AGO) \nSame flashback as before, in Laurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little girl. There's arguing downstairs. Laurie goes down to investigate. She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her PARENTS inside, arguing . \nSALLY You wanted to hear it, so I'm telling you, okay?. Magic! Dreams! That's what I had before. I was a hero goddammit! \nLAURIE'S FATHER It's not my fault you got old! What do you have to complain about?! I'm putting food on the table for you and your child. Why don't you give your friend Eddie a call? Maybe he can give you a better life! \nSALLY It was a mistake--one time! Am I never-- And then they notice Laurie looking at them. \nLAURIE Mommy? \nSALLY Oh. Oh, Laurie \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Tears run down little Laurie's face. Her parents are \nHORRIFIED-- \nINT. GLASS PALACE - MARS - NIGHT \n--Laurie breaks away from ion and drops down to her knees, tears flowing. \nLAURIE No. No, no, no, no not him \nDR. MANHATTAN The comedian was your father. \nLAURIE But he-- \nDR. MANHATTAN Attacked your mother. Yes. (searching in his mind) Two years later he came back to her, to make amends. And you were conceived on that day. \nLAURIE \nNO!!I Laurie WHIPS a BOTTLE at the palace-- --and the huge glass construction CRUMBLES. Jon protects them with a FORCE FIELD as debris collapses around them. Laurie sobs in the echoing SILENCE. Jon's eyes SHUT. He seems to feel . empathy. A TEAR slips down his cheek. Laurie's realization is a revelation for ion. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) The comedian is my father. I guess my life is just one big joke. \nDR. MANHATTAN I don't think your life is a joke. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nADRIAN Really, getting even this far is an admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Let's hope they know when to stop. \nINT. KARNAK - DAWN \nHaving burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its Macedonian massiveness. \nDAN \nJESUS \n(BEAT) I don't understand any of this. Adrian's a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's sake! \nRORSCHACH Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance. \nINT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN \nDan and Rorschach pass the wall of plasma screens into-- \nINT. DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS \n--the dining hall, where Adrian eats alone, at a long table. Though they're only a few yards away, Adrian doesn't appear to see them, hidden by some PILLARS. Dan and Rorschach signal to each other, quiet. Adrian eats-- --and Rorschach RUSHES him from behind-- --Adrian moves at the last second, grabs Rorschach's arm, ELBOWS him in the chest, spins and BACKHAND FISTS him, sending him flying back. \nADRIAN Mind your manners. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Dan draws his PEN-LASER. \nDAN Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray-- --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS, Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm. \nADRIAN Now. What can I do for you? \nDAN You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon! \nADRIAN Yes. \nDAN Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do? \nADRIAN What we always intended--to improve the world. As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor. Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up and they follow. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I never intended to kill the Comedian-- that was an accident. Part of his duties as a government operative was to keep track of all former masked heroes, make sure there was no rocking of the boat. He must have liked Rorschach because he allowed him to continue to exist. I had thought that the Comedian might be incompetent, but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really going on. here in Karnak--no easy task. Even my staff was unaware--I made sure to keep each department separate. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nADRIAN (CONT'D) The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but still, he understood the scope of what I was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I never thought he'd actually talk. But by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. So I had to kill him. \nINT. CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS \nAs they enter the control hall, Rorschach moves to attack Adrian again when he and Dan hear a growl . the Lynx steps in between, protecting its master. \nADRIAN After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan nearly a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence. By then, Rorschach's mask theory, 'though erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I faked my own assassination-- \nDAN Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant? \nADRIAN I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then, wouldn't I? Adrian smiles enigmatically. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) After apprehending my own assassin, I shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth, disposing of him, and soon after that, the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all the loose ends if you will. Then I knew nothing stood in the way of my triumph. \nDAN Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do? \nADRIAN I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy, synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself, into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe, crossing all traditional politics and ideologies; \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRORSCHACH Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDR. MANHATTAN Rorschach, you know I can't let you do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes. \nRORSCHACH Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it. \nDAN \nNO WAIT! \nRORSCHACH \nDO IT!!!! Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH APART. Dan collapses to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the BURN-MARK where Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears-- --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens. \nDR. MANHATTAN Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one a little less complicated. \nLAURIE Leaving? I, I thought you regained an interest in human life. \nDR. MANHATTAN I have. I think maybe I'll create some. Goodbye, Laurie. He kisses her on the cheek-- \nADRIAN Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made myself feel every death, see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity--you understand, don't you? \nDR. MANHATTAN Without condoning or condemning, I \nUNDERSTAND And with that, he disappears. Forever. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward Adrian. \nADRIAN What's on your mind, Dan? \nDAN Your death. \nADRIAN Really. You want to kill me? \nDAN Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done. \nADRIAN That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That sounds more like Rorschach. \nDAN Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV screens. \nADRIAN Only you're not Rorschach, are you now? How do you expect to succeed where he failed? \nDAN Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily. \nLAURIE Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor, knocking her out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he \nFLICKS IT AT ADRIAN-- Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs. Prepares to finish Dan off. \nADRIAN I have to say, I've always thought your choice of an owl was quite juvenile. \nDAN Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE. \nDAN (CONT'D) because you can never hear them coming. BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL- SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan. Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor. Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered. Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying. \nADRIAN I . don't regret my actions. I know in my heart . I did the right thing. \nDAN So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies. \nINT. OWL-SHIP - MORNING \nDan sits painfully in the passenger seat, as Laurie tries to pilot the ship out of Adrian's bedroom. \nDAN That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test1_input": "CHAMBER\u00c2\u0080\u0094 \nJON OSTERMAN (CONT'D) \n(YELLING) I'll catch up with you guys--I left my watch inside .

As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR INITIATING, the big mechanical parts moving. Jon runs to the door, BANGS on it. \nJON OSTERMAN Janey: Oh my god!

Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten. \nLAURIE Agent Forbes. \nAGENT FORBES (distracted, annoyed) What? \nLAURIE I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET SERVICE AGENT to escort her. \nINT.

I'd better follow him \n", "test3_true": "INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nJon enters the MAZE of advanced technology. \nDR. MANHATTAN Adrian, don't be foolish. Even if I can't predict where I'm going to find you, I can turn the walls to glass. The tachyons were clever but it's time to give up Jon spots the Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) Very well. If I must, let us follow this through to the bitter end. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is Adrian, waiting by a CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his Lynx. \nADRIAN Forgive me, girl. Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a SWITCH. The Lynx' FUR STANDS ON END as ENERGY CRACKLES BETWEEN THE METAL WALLS. The Lynx HOWLS. \nDR. MANHATTAN Adrian? Adrian, don't-- LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED. Adrian peers around the corner, winded by his success. \nADRIAN You know, I really wasn't sure that would work. \nLAURIE (O.S.) \nADRIAN-- Adrian turns. Laurie aims the prison guard's pistol at him. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) You're such an asshole. Adrian cries out, LEAPS at her as she FIRES-- --and hits Adrian. He COLLAPSES. Dan and Rorschach find them as Laurie approaches Adrian's body \nDAN Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood trickling, as his PALM OPENS-- --holding a BULLET inside. \nLAURIE Oh shit. Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her in the stomach, sending her flying back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDAN LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll-- \nADRIAN Oh Dan. Grow up. Adrian exits as Dan helps the winded Laurie to her feet. Together, Rorschach, Dan and Laurie follow him back to: \nINT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - MORNING \nAdrian approaches his wall of TV screens when-- \nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) \nI AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU ADRIAN. VERY \nDISAPPOINTED. Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian crawls desperately away, grasping for his remote on the floor. As Jon approaches him, Jon SHRINKS to six feet. \nDR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) Restructuring myself was the first trick I learned! It didn't kill me before, did you seriously think it would kill me now? You are nothing but a man. And the world's smartest man means no more to me than its smartest termite! Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote. \nDR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate weapon? \nADRIAN Yes. Yes, you could say that. Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news reports. We hear SOUND BITES and IMAGES: \"India and Pakistan immediately call for truce,\" \"China stands down,\" \"US withdraws forces,\" \"Israel agrees on cease fire.\" TEARS stand in Adrian's eyes. He raises his fists in triumph. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I did it. I DID IT! I've saved Earth from Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the vaulting stature of Heaven. \nLAURIE Next? You can't get away with this! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nADRIAN No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace so many have just died for? Morally, you're in checkmate, just like the Comedian was. Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in. \nDR. MANHATTAN I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again. \nDAN He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth. \nLAURIE We we can't say anything about this \nRORSCHACH You're joking, of course. Rorschach walks toward the exit. \nDAN Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out! \nRORSCHACH Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach. \nDAN Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit. \nDR. MANHATTAN Where are you going, Rorschach? \n", "test3_id": 3137}

WYATT Sure... 
JOHNSON One thing.  We come through this Alive, can we keep the badges? 
Wyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward the stream by himself.  Moments later, McMasters approaches: 
MCMASTERS Where's Wyatt? 
DOC Down at the creek.  Walking on water. 
EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT 
Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before him: 
1ST COWBOY We hit him half a dozen times but He just kept comin', walked right Up to Curly Bill with that 10 Gauge and blew him up! 
RINGO Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill? 
Ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in panic.... 
2ND COWBOY He didn't just kill him, he Burned him down!  Blew him in Half!  I mean all the way in half, Like a melon!  Then he turned Around with that big Colt and Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a Couple more 'fore we got out of there.  But it was his face, you should've seen his face. 
RINGO He's just a man. 
1ST COWBOY You didn't see his face 
Ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank. 
RINGO You see my face, don't you? 
Out of nowhere, Ringo draws and FIRES 2 shots so quickly they sound like one.  The 2 survivors drop with bullets through their brains.  The others jump, transfixed by the insane brutality of what he's just done.  Ringo draws himself up, in full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, matchless: 
RINGO Everybody get this through their Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm Running the show now and I'm Telling you, Earp dies.  His men Too.  They all die.  Understand? We're gonna kill 'em.  For what They did to Curly Bill we're Gonna ride 'em into the ground And slaughter 'em like rabbits. 'Cause this is my time, children. This is where I get woolly. 
EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT 
Later.  Most of the others are asleep or talking among themselves as Billy Grounds turns to Zwing Hunt, whispering: 
GROUNDS What d'you think?  I didn't think Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm Tellin' you, this whole thing's Gone sour.  We got hands droppin' Like flies and Ringo's flat out Of his mind.  I mean, hell Brother, you feel like ridin' Against Wyatt Earp? 
HUNT Hell no, brother. 
GROUNDS Then brother let's you and me cut out. 
HUNT Right with you, brother. 
They steal away toward the horses as.... 
INT - ALLEN STREET - DAY 
Ringo faces Behan, grim, intent, while Behan sputters, holding up a San Francisco newspaper: 
BEHAN Are you crazy?  It's front page News all over the country.  It's Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If Things don't settle down soon- 
RINGO You heard me, Behan. 
BEHAN Ringo, you don't understand- 
Ringo glares at Behan, his eyes burning, implacable: 
RINGO No, you don't understand. 
EXT - COWBOY CAMP - DAY 
Ringo rides up with Behan and dismounts.  A 3rd Cowboy steps up: 
3RD COWBOY Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran Out.  Four, five others, too. 
RINGO Who cares?  Separate the wheat From the chaff. 
Behan looks worried as Ike and the other Cowboys gather around.  Just then Breakenridge rides up. 
BEHAN What're you doing here, Billy? 
BREAKENRIDGE Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd Like to come with you. 
RINGO Sure, why not? 
Ringo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his men.  His unaccustomed good humor is very troubling. 
RINGO I told you it was time to get Woolly.  Now gather 'round, Children, gather 'round.  And Raise your right hands. 
EXT - DESERT - DAY

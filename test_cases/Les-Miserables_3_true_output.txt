WHORES Old men, young men, take'em as they come! Harbour rats and alley cats And every kind of scum! Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land - See them with their trousers off, They're never quite as grand! All it takes is money in your hand! 
The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress. The pimp joins the captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates - like a twisted wedding ceremony. 
WHORES Lovely ladies Going for a song, (more) 
WHORES (cont'd) Got a lot of callers But they never stay for long... 
Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel. 
FANTINE Come on, Captain, you can wear your shoes. Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse? 
27   INT. ROTTING SHIP'S HULK, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                  27 
Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. 
We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter, then Fantine lays down. 
FANTINE Easy money lying on a bed. Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head! Don't they know they're making love To one already dead? 
28   INT. ROTTING SHIP'S HULK, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                  28 
CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. We hear him exit. MOVE TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress. 
She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. She draws her legs up and wraps her arms round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world. 
FANTINE There was a time when men were kind, When their voices were soft And their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting. There was a time... Then it all went wrong. 
I dreamed a dream in time gone by, When hope was high And life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. (more) 
FANTINE (cont'd) 
Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, No song unsung, no wine untasted. 
But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame. 
He slept a summer by my side, He filled my days with endless wonder. He took my childhood in his stride But he was gone when autumn came. 
And still I dream he'll come to me! That we will live the years together... But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather... 
I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living - So different now from what it seemed! Now life has killed the dream I dreamed. 
As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head whore beyond. 
29   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                 29 
Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. 
She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. 
As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well- dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet. 
BAMATABOIS Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try. Come closer, you! I like to see what I buy. The usual price For just one slice of your pie. 
FANTINE I don't want you! No! No, M'sieur! Let me go! 
BAMATABOIS Is this a trick? I won't pay more! 
FANTINE No, not at all! 
BAMATABOIS You've got some nerve, you little slut! You've got some gall! It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer The customer sees what he gets in advance It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir" It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance! 
He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the snow and Bamatabois laughs. 
FANTINE I'll kill you, you bastard! Try any of that! Even a whore who has gone to the bad Won't be had by a rat! 
Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall. 
BAMATABOIS (furious but aroused) By Christ you'll pay for what you've done! This rat will make you bleed, you'll see! I guarantee I'll make you suffer! For this disturbance of the peace For this insult to life and property! 
Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived. 
FANTINE I beg you, don't report me, sir. I'll do whatever you may want. 
BAMATABOIS Make your excuse to the police! 
Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's Javert. 
JAVERT Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl? 
BAMATABOIS Javert, would you believe it? I was walking, it was dark When this prostitute attacked me You can see she's left her mark!

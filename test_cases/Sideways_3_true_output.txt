EXT. ORCHARD - DAY 
Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER. Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE. 
MAYA You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. 
MILES Great. What's the latest we can get there? 
MAYA About two-thirty. 
MILES Okay. 
MAYA (noticing) Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend? 
Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it down -- 
MILES No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner. 
MAYA What rehearsal dinner? 
Miles stops writing. 
MAYA Who's getting married? 
INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY 
Maya leads the way toward the Saab. 
MAYA Were you ever going to say anything? 
MILES Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth. 
Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break." Miles reaches out to touch her. 
MILES Maya. 
MAYA (jerking away) Don't touch me. Just take me home. 
INT. SAAB - DAY 
Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares straight ahead. 
MILES I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control. 
MAYA Do you know what he's been saying to her? 
MILES He's an actor, so it can't be good. 
MAYA Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to. 
MILES I'm sure he believed every word. 
A stony silence. 
MILES Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but... 
MAYA But you wanted to fuck me first. 
MILES Oh, Maya. No. 
MAYA Yeah. 
EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins to get out. 
MAYA You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine. 
MILES And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State. 
Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't just yet. 
MAYA Could I have my paper, please? 
Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches until she goes inside. 
EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY 
Miles pulls up and parks. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story. 
JACK Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy? 
MILES Put me down, Jack. 
Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night. 
MILES I said put me down. Jack! 
Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both cheeks. 
JACK I'm so proud of you! Let me love you! 
Now they get up off the bed. 
JACK So tell me everything. Details. I like details. 
MILES No.

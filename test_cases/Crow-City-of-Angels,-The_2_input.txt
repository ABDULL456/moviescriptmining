EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT 
Ashe Cries out a final time as a GAPING WOUND appears on his chest, BLOOD BLOSSOMING outward. 
CITY STREET 
The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers... 
ASHE 
comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form. 
INT. JUDAH'S CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT 
The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood is pooling beneath black flight feathers. 
Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime. 
JUDAH 
It's done. 
Judah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result is an eerie reflecting pool. 
AS WE WATCH, THE IMAGE OF THE CLOUDS 
cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve, only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection. 
BACK TO SCENE 
With a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of blood over one eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear over his lips... 
The action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's face - a parallel ritual turned on its head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT 
Judah turns towards us, his transformation now complete. We see that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in the Crow's own blood. 
SARAH 
watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity. 
JUDAH 
scoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his lips. 
CLOSE ON JUDAH'S LIPS 
as he drinks, letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck. 
CLOSE ON JUDAH'S FACE 
his once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance. 
WE RISE UP 
from Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower. Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death itself. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - STREET 
Ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers. 
THE MASKED CELEBRANTS 
slowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel. 
CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE 
Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether or not Ashe's soul has fled. 
The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder to a stop. And the only thing we hear are... 
THE CROWS 
Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS. 
Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken, but waken he does... 
ASHE'S POV - THE SKY ABOVE JUDAH'S TOWER 
is black with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling madly about. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Ashe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened. Then his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him. We are in dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality.

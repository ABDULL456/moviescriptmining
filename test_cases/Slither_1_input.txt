A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth. He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and his body starts to spasm. 
Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body, too, convulses, and he spits up blood. 
Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the things oozing up Margaret's neck. 
BILL Margaret, cover your mouth! 
Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone: 
BILL Don't let 'em in your mouths! 
One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face. 
Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls back onto the floor. 
A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when, suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla. 
Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them, flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to himself and Starla. 
Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound. 
Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from Starla's mouth. Starla looks around. 
She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering, holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front door of the barn. 
EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT 
Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist. 
TREVOR They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why would they want that!? 
INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT 
Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug. 
He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still lightly convulsing. 
He gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they head off in different directions. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT 
Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby. 
INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back, her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm. 
EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking to the wood siding. 
INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still. 
There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail. 
KYLIE'S MOM Kylie! You're gonna turn into a plum in there! 
KYLIE Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes. 
INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door. 
KYLIE'S MOM I know what turns into what. You got school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed. 
O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement. 
Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door. 
She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to -- 
INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards. 
KYLIE'S MOM Time to turn in, ladies. 
KYLIE'S SISTER 1 Just a couple more pages, Mom?

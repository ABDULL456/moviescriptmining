BRENT I'm looking for Lisa Sherman. 
CARETAKER She's not here. 
BRENT You know where I can find her? 
CARETAKER St. Michael's. 
BRENT She works at a church? 
CARETAKER She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago. 
Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her. It's been a  long time since he's confronted his hidden past. He puts his gun away. 
BRENT Of what? 
CARETAKER A bullet to the right cerebellum. 
BRENT She was murdered? 
CARETAKER No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day. 
Brent can't help but feel responsible. 
BRENT Can you describe her? How old was she? 
CARETAKER I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it. 
BRENT Can you get inside? 
CARETAKER I can. 
BRENT I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here. 
CARETAKER I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant. 
He pulls out his wallet. 
Cut to: 
EXT.  KENNY'S HOUSE 
Jody rides up to Kenny's house. 
INT.  HOUSE 
Kenny sees her from his bedroom window. 
INT.  FRONT HALLWAY 
Kenny comes tearing downstairs. 
EXT.  FRONT DOOR 
Kenny, opens the front door, very excited. 
KENNY Jody! (he kisses her) Yes! You're here. 
Jody wipes a tear from her eye. Kenny notices how upset she is. 
KENNT(CONT'D) What's the matter? 
Jody bursts into tears. She hugs him. He hugs her back and leads her inside. 
INT.  HOUSE 
An old rundown house. The clutter smells. Whoever lived here had little to no self respect. Garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere. Brent is repulsed by what he sees. he wasn't expecting such chaos. He knows he helped create this mess. 
BRENT Is there a picture of her somewhere? 
CARETAKER No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her? 
BRENT (feeling very guilty) No. 
CARETAKER Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh? 
BRENT No, you couldn't. 
CARETAKER I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest. 
BRENT Really? 
CARETAKER Yeah. You should check downstairs. 
BRENT Why?

Suddenly a terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman. \nEXT - CONVENT - NIGHT \nLights in the windows flick on. \nINT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps, calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying... \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Agnes!... Agnes... \nEXT - CONVENT - NIGHT \nAn ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and the ambulance drives inside. \nINT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTwo PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately wipes and kisses her face. \nPARAMEDIC I'm just going to put something here to stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister.

A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle of interest. \nREPORTER Here they are now. \nMartha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse. \nINT - JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nInside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing by the window smoking furiously. \nLEVEAU Martha, it's you. \nMARTHA What about Roger? He's free. \nEVE They want a woman. \nLYON All you have to do is meet with her once or twice... then tell the court she's insane. \nMARTHA Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here. \nEVE Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me. \nMARTHA Eve, she strangled a baby! \nEVE Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison. \nLEVEAU We're not telling you what to decide Martha. We're not even telling you to take this. \nLYON Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it? \nMartha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns. \nMARTHA Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday. \nThe Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down on his desk towards her. \nLEVEAU Happy birthday. \n15   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMartha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her answerphone and moves over to her cat. \nMARTHA \nHi, Kitty. \nThe answerphone whirs... \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow, okay? Bye bye. \nSome whirs and clicks. \nROGER (V.O.) Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy birthday.    Bye. \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye. \nMAN (in French) \nMartha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on the front. \n", "test1_id": 201, "test2_input": "I am saying (distorted) a beautifully simple woman... \nMARTHA An unhappy woman... \nMOTHER MIRIAM She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone. \nMARTHA Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh? \nMARTHA (cont.) Why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Because I am a moral person. \nMARTHA Bullshit! \nMOTHER MIRIAM Bullshit yourself! \nMARTHA Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality... \nMOTHER MIRIAM Who said anything about the Catholic Church... \nMARTHA You just said... \nMOTHER MIRIAM What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you? \nMARTHA Nothing... \nMOTHER MIRIAM What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? \nThis time it is Martha who walks away and Mother Miriam who follows her. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) So instead of questioning that one rule... \nMARTHA (halting) It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run \nover on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Stupid woman... and that's all? \nMARTHA That's all? That's enough!   She was a beautiful little girl. \nMOTHER MIRIAM And what has that to do with it? \nMARTHA I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston. \nMOTHER MIRIAM So you left the Church because you had freckles? \nMARTHA No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles. \nThey both cannot help laughing at this absurdity. \n62   EXT - COURTYARD - DAY \nA couple of nuns walk across the courtyard. Another is meditating alone. On a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away. \n63   EXT - GAZEBO - DAY \nIt is out the back of the convent near the belltower. Mother Miriam and Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking. \nMOTHER MIRIAM When I was a child I used to hear my guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I was six years old. That's when I stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing by \nher window, singing. And all my doubts about \nmyself and God were gone, in that one moment. I recognized the voice. Please don't take it away from me again Doctor Livingston. Those years after six were very bleak. \nMARTHA My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. (a long pause) Does my smoking bother you? \n", "test2_true": "MARTHA Would you like one? Huh? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I'd love one. \nMartha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. Mother Miriam coughs a lot. Martha pats her on the back. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I'm out of prac... (cough) ... practice. (cough) \nMARTHA All right? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Fine thanks... \nMARTHA Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More... \nMARTHA (chuckles) Long, thin and filtered. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. (they roar with laughter) And of course (distorted) \nMARTHA Hand rolled. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Even Christ would partake socially. \nMARTHA Saint Peter? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Pipe! \nMARTHA Right... \nMOTHER MIRIAM Mary Magdelen? \nMARTHA (imitating) Oh, you've come a long way baby. \nMOTHER MIRIAM And Saint John would chew tobacco. \nMore laughter, then the moment because more serious. \nMARTHA Right. (a pause) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking? \nMOTHER MIRIAM There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking. \nMARTHA Do you think they ever existed? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Yes I do. \nMARTHA Do you want to become one? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Become?     One is born a saint. \nMARTHA Well you can try, can't you, to be good? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. (she stands) \nNo more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. (Martha gets up too) Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles. \nThey start walking back to the convent. \nMARTHA Do you think Agnes is still attached to God? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Listen to her singing. \nMARTHA (a pause) I'd like to begin. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Begin what? \n", "test2_id": 202, "test3_input": "AGNES Stay away from me... \nMARTHA Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand? \nAGNES No... \nMARTHA He    frightened you and he hurt you. It's not    your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who    he is so we can find him. Stop him    from doing this to other women. \nAGNES Not your fault... \nMARTHA Agnes who did you see? \nAGNES I hate him... \nMARTHA Of course you do. Who was it? \nAGNES I hate him for what he did to me. \nMARTHA Yes. \nAGNES For what he made me go through. \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES I hate him. \nMARTHA Agnes, who did this to you? \nAgnes flings her arms back against the wall. \nAGNES God!  It was God. (sinks to her knees) And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. \nMARTHA Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. \nMOTHER MIRIAM That's enough. \nMARTHA Agnes, what happened to the baby? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (shouting) She can't remember. \nMARTHA What happened to the baby? \nAGNES It was dead. \nMARTHA It was alive wasn't it? \nAGNES I don't remember. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (screaming) Oh, don't do this! \nMARTHA Wasn't it! \nAGNES YES! \nSomehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat. Mother Miriam   is looking utterly resigned. \nMARTHA Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she? \nAGNES \nYes. \nMARTHA She took the baby in her arms? \nAGNES Yes. \n", "test3_true": "AGNES Yes. \nMARTHA And then... what did she do? (no answer) Agnes what did she do? \nAGNES She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake. \nAGNES (cont.) I thought I... I can save her. (she raises her hands) I can give her back to God. \nMARTHA What did you do? \nAGNES I put her to sleep. \nMARTHA H... how? \nAGNES I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can. \nMother Miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the cross and prays. Martha claps her hands lightly together once. \n90   EXT - CITY - DAY \nA shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the city. Angle on the courthouse. \n91   INT - COURT ROOM - DAY \nAll the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha, \nAgnes, Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing up. \nLEVEAU In view of the situation as it now stands, and the testimony given here this morning, it seems quite clear that the defendant was in no manner responsible for her actions. It is therefore the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of Marie Madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision by a visiting physician. \nBoth Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice Leveau continues to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up. \nLEVEAU (Cont.) (surprised) Oui. Do you have something to say? \nAGNES (a long pause) I stood in the window of my room every night for a week. And one night I heard the most beautiful voice imaginable. And when I looked I saw the moon shining down on him. For six nights he sang to me, songs I'd never heard. And on the seventh night he opened his wings and lay on top of me. All the while he sang - (sings) Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet... Charlie's a... \nLEVEAU Please, remove her from the court. \nMartha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly. \nLEVEAU Would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom. (continues in French) \nThe nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the court. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n92   EXT - CONVENT - DAY \nIt is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings dissolving into one another. \nMARTHA (V.O.) I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction. And the father was a fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago. And the father was hope and... and love and desire. And a belief in miracles. \nThe nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to the convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard. \nMARTHA (V.O.) I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her, and I hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me. That would be miracle enough wouldn't it? \nDISSOLVE TO: \n93   EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY \nWhere Agnes is singing her song among the doves. She stops singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes on of the doves and lets it fly away across the snowy landscape. \nFADE OUT.

{"train": "AGNES OF GOD FADE IN: \nEXT - CONVENT - DAY \nWhispering of nuns at prayer. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT - CHAPEL - DAY \nNuns at prayer; MOTHER MIRIAM, the Superior closes the gate and locks it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - COURTYARD - DAY \nThe nuns walking around the courtyard in an anticlockwise direction saying the rosary. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT - CHAPEL - DAY \nA line of nuns kneeling at prayer. Closeups of various individuals. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - CONVENT - NIGHT \nA single shot of the building. \nINT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nSISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors, turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman. \nEXT - CONVENT - NIGHT \nLights in the windows flick on. \nINT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps, calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying... \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Agnes!... Agnes... \nEXT - CONVENT - NIGHT \nAn ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and the ambulance drives inside. \nINT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTwo PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately wipes and kisses her face. \nPARAMEDIC I'm just going to put something here to stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister. She'll be fine. \nThey lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall. \nThe Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into... \nINT - SISTER AGNES' ROOM - NIGHT \nShe kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and starts to pull them out. Then she freezes, makes the sign of the cross and starts to weep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - MONTREAL - NIGHT \nDISSOLVE TO: \n16   EXT - CONVENT - DAY \nMartha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets out, cigarette in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads \"Les Petites Soeurs de Marie Madeleine\". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister Marguerite looks out. \nMARTHA Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha Livingston, I... \nThe peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister Marguerite glares at her. \nMARTHA (Cont.) Hello... I'm Doctor Martha Living...ston... I... \nMartha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the trouble and hastily     grinds it underfoot. \nMARTHA (Cont.) \nExcuse me... I'm... \nSister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha awkwardly tries to kick it away. \nMARTHA (Cont.) ...the court-appointed psychiatrist. \nSister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and motions for her to    come in. \nMARTHA (Cont.) Thank you. I um... I believe your Mother Superior's expecting me. \nMartha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent. \n17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY \nMartha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room. Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight start. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (beaming at her own little joke) Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call Mother if you don't wish. (shaking hands) Most people find it uncomfortable. \nMARTHA Well... I... \nMOTHER MIRIAM (carrying right on) I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age... \nMARTHA Yes... I... \nMOTHER MIRIAM You can call me Sister. \nMARTHA ... Thank you. \nMOTHER MIRIAM You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters. \nMartha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) They wouldn't understand, especially Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants off Queen Elizabeth. (she lights Martha's cigarette) Besides, I miss them. \nMARTHA You were a smoker? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Two packs a day. \nMARTHA I can beat that. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Unfiltered. \nMartha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down next to her. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) Well, you have questions. (checks her watch) Fire away... \nMARTHA Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? \nMOTHER MIRIAM No-one. \nThen Mother Miriam walks out. \n18   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY \nA little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of the grilled room and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the voice of a single young woman can be heard singing in Latin. \n19     INT - TOP CORRIDOR - DAY \nMartha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing. They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see... \n20     INT - AGNES' ROOM - DAY \n... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily, looking out the window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly. She turns to see Martha standing in the doorway. \nMARTHA Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I? \nAGNES Yes. \nMartha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers outside the door. \nMARTHA You have a lovely voice. \nAGNES No I don't. \nMARTHA I just heard you. \nAGNES That wasn't me. \nMARTHA Was it Sister Marguerite? \nAgnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old nun. \nMARTHA (Cont.) You're very pretty Agnes. \nAGNES No I'm not. \nMARTHA Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? \nAGNES Let's talk about something else. \nMARTHA What would you like to talk about. \nAGNES I don't know. \nMARTHA Anything... may I sit down? \nAGNES Yes. \nThey both sit. \nMARTHA First thing that comes to your mind? \nAGNES God!    But there's nothing to say about God. \nMARTHA Second thing that comes to your mind. \nAGNES Love. \nMARTHA Have you ever loved anyone? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES Everyone. \nMARTHA Did it hurt? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Where? \nAGNES Down... there. \nMARTHA And what did you do? \nAGNES I went to my room. \nMARTHA And what happened? \nAGNES I got sicker. \nMARTHA \nAnd then what? \nAGNES I fell asleep. \nMARTHA In the middle of all the pain? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Where did the baby come from? \nAGNES What baby? \nMARTHA The baby they made up. \nAGNES From their heads... \nMARTHA Is that where they say it came from... ? \nAGNES No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! \nMARTHA Where'd it come from before that? \nAGNES From God. \nMARTHA After God... before the waste-paper basket. \nAGNES I... I don't understand. \nMARTHA Agnes, how are babies born? \nAGNES Don't you know? \nMARTHA Yes I do,    but I want you to... \nAGNES (very agitated) I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants \nto talk about    the baby but... I never saw the    baby so I can't talk about the baby    because... I don't believe in the    baby. \nMARTHA Then let's talk about something else... \nAGNES (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. \nMARTHA (also standing) Agnes... \nAGNES (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions. \nMARTHA Would you like to ask them? \nAnd her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the bell \ntower. \nAGNES (Cont.) (to Martha) God loves you. \nMARTHA Do you know a Marie? \nAGNES No... do you? \nMARTHA Why should I? \nAGNES I don't know. \n23   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY \nMother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha enters. Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good humour. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar. \nMARTHA What's your opinion? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I believe Agnes is different. \nMARTHA From other nuns... (laughs) Yes I... I've noticed. \nMOTHER MIRIAM From other people! (moving across the room) I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. \nMARTHA How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God. \nMARTHA (lights a cigarette) \nThat's ridiculous... \nMOTHER MIRIAM (moves to her desk, starts writing) In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book. \nMARTHA If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child? \nMOTHER MIRIAM She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her. \nMARTHA So, someone else could have done it. \nMOTHER MIRIAM No... not in the eyes of the police. \nMARTHA And in your eyes? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I've already told you what I thought. \nMARTHA That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the... \nMOTHER MIRIAM You don't really believe something like that happened do you? \nMARTHA It's possible isn't it? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Who? \nMARTHA One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal. \nMother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and bangs it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray. \nMOTHER MIRIAM That's absurd! \nMARTHA That possibility never occurred to you? \nMARTHA I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite. \nMAMA Not any more... now I like chocolate. \nMARTHA (stroking her hair) Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right? \nMAMA You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God. \nMARTHA (lighting up) Marie's dead Mama. \nMAMA I remember when you    was a little girl Marie. You come back    from the movies and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so sad... and I'd tell    you they had all the happy endings locked    away in a vault in Hollywood. (chuckles) And you believed me. \nMARTHA Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me! \nMAMA (a long pause) Who are you? \nMARTHA I... I'm Martha, Mama. \n31   EXT - CONVENT, CHICKENYARD - DAY \nIt is raining... distant thunder in the background. Martha is standing under an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the chickens. \nSISTER ANNE The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens. \nMARTHA How do you survive? \nSISTER ANNE Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, (indicating) some wheat, corn, some vegetables. \nMARTHA Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you? \nSISTER ANNE No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. \nMARTHA Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? \nSister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the convent. \nSISTER ANNE Oh that one there, in the corner. \nMARTHA The one up on the third floor? \nSISTER ANNE Yes. \nMARTHA Uh huh. \n32   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY \nMother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for Martha. They both      enter the room which is totally plain, stripped of everything. \nMOTHER MIRIAM This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark. \nMARTHA Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made. \nMARTHA When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Shortly after she came to us. \nMARTHA And you weren't shocked? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I was appalled, just as you are now. \nMARTHA And what happened? \nMOTHER MIRIAM She stopped eating completely... \nMOTHER MIRIAM Why? \nAGNES Look at the statues, they're thin. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Agnes... \nAGNES That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Who tells you these things? \nAGNES Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (genuinely distressed) That's not what he meant. \nAGNES I...    I am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where... \nAgnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts. \nAGNES No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Oh my dear child. \nAGNES (standing) God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said... \nMOTHER MIRIAM Who? \nAGNES Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead. \nAGNES But she watches... she listens. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. \nAGNES I'm not hungry. \nMOTHER MIRIAM \nYou've got to eat something Agnes. \nAGNES No I don't... the host is enough. \nMOTHER MIRIAM My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything. \nAGNES Of God. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (smiles) Yes, of God. \nThen Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes' white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto the floor. She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with shock; there is a bleeding hole in the middle of her palm. \nAGNES I'm being punished. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Why? \nAGNES I don't know. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Dear Jesus... \nShe quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel. \nAGNES It started this morning and I can't get it to stop. \n34   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY \nAGNES (very quietly) I thought... thoughts... about... \nFATHER MARTINEAU Speak up, I can hardly hear you. \nAGNES (very loudly) I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n40   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMartha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of the sheets and the waste-paper basket. She puts the photos aside and puffs thoughtfully on a cigarette. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n41   EXT - CONVENT FARM - DAY \nAgnes is milking the cow. She pours the milk into a large churn. (The singing finishes at this point). \n42   INT - JUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe same four are in a meeting. This time they are all sitting except for Lyon who is standing by the window. \nLEVEAU Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long. \nMARTHA Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here. \nLYON Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to heal and play detective. Who do you think you are? \nMARTHA I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon. My duty as a doctor is to... \nEVE Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law. \nMARTHA No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. \nEVE The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us. \nMARTHA Why? \nEVE The bishop is breathing down our necks. \nMARTHA And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be? \nLEVEAU (in French) \nMARTHA I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this. \nLYON Well the bishop will be very upset about this. \nMARTHA I'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop. \n43   EXT - CONVENT GRAVEYARD - DAY \nIt is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very simple. Martha is standing. Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked with the name \"Soeur Marie Paul\" and the dates she was born, consecrated and died. Agnes places some winter flowers on the grave. \nMARTHA You liked Sister Paul? \nAGNES She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. \nMARTHA (crouching down) What else did she tell you? \nAGNES She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. \nAgnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start to move off. \nAGNES (Cont.) She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place. \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES I don't know. \nMARTHA Agnes... \nAGNES You'll laugh. \nMARTHA I promise I won't laugh. Who told her? \nAGNES An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. \nMARTHA Did your mother see angels often? \nAGNES No. \nMARTHA Do you? \nAGNES No. \nMARTHA Do you believe she really saw them? \nAGNES (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that. \nMARTHA Why not? (no answer) Mmm? \nAGNES She'd get angry. \nMartha moves round close to Agnes. \nMARTHA Agnes, did you love your mother? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? \nAGNES I could never be a mother. \nMARTHA Why not? \nAGNES Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. \nMARTHA Why not? \nAGNES Because I don't want one. \nMARTHA If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? \nAGNES From someone who didn't want to have a baby. \nMARTHA Like you? \nAGNES \n(suddenly frustrated) No, not like me! \nMARTHA How would that person get one if they didn't want one? \nAGNES (jumping to her feet) A mistake... \nMARTHA Agnes, how did your mother get you? \nAGNES A mistake... it was a mistake... \nMARTHA \nMOTHER MIRIAM ???     (distorted) \nMARTHA ??? (distorted) ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. (she sits) \nMARTHA Then help her. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I am... \nMARTHA No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world. \nMOTHER MIRIAM What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin. \nMARTHA There's another choice. \nMOTHER MIRIAM What? \nMARTHA Aquittal. \nMOTHER MIRIAM How? \nMARTHA Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court. \nA long pause. The tension between them dissolves. \nMOTHER MIRIAM All right, what do you need. \nMARTHA Answers. \nMartha holds her hand. \n47   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY \nSame place, but a little later. Martha is smoking. \nMARTHA When would Agnes have conceived the child? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Oh, some time in January. \nMARTHA Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Earthquakes? \nMARTHA Visitors to the convent. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Nothing. \nMARTHA Do you have a... a diary or a day book? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Yes. \nMARTHA Take at look at it. \nMother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book. \nMOTHER MIRIAM There's nothing here. \nMARTHA \nWas the child full term? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (reads through the book) Oh, Dear God... \nMARTHA What is it? \nAGNES ... makes me... \nMARTHA Yes? \nAGNES ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me. \nMARTHA She tells you you're ugly? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA And that you're stupid? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA That you're a mistake? \nAGNES She says my whole body's a mistake. \nMARTHA Why? \nAGNES Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby. \nMARTHA How does she know that? \nAGNES Her headaches. \nMARTHA Oh, yes. \nAGNES And then... \nMARTHA What? \nAGNES She touches me down there with a cigarette. (Martha gasps) Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more. \nMARTHA Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright? \nAGNES I'm afraid. \nMARTHA Please!    I want to help you. Let me help you. \nAGNES Alright. \nMARTHA Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? \nAGNES No I'm not. \nMARTHA Are you pretty? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Agnes, you're stupid. \nAGNES No I'm not. \nMARTHA Are you intelligent? \nAGNES (more forcefully) Yes I am. \nMARTHA You're a mistake. \nAGNES (shouting) I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake... \nAgnes is half shouting , half crying. Martha holds on to her. \nMARTHA Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Yes. \nMARTHA Listening to angels? \nMOTHER MIRIAM She drank too much. That's what killed her. \nMARTHA Do you know what she did to her? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I don't think I care to know. \nMARTHA She molested her! \nMOTHER MIRIAM Oh, dear God. \nMARTHA There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (crying) Oh God, if only I'd known. \nMARTHA Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I knew that after the fact. \nMARTHA Why didn't you do anything to stop her? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Because I didn't know... (she leaves) \nMARTHA Oh, God. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n58   INT - POLICE STATION, LARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nLarry is interviewing a young PROSTITUTE in French. Martha appears at the door. \nMARTHA Larry... \nLARRY Marty, what are you doing here? \nMARTHA Larry there's got to be something missing. \nLARRY I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want? \nMARTHA \nSomething they... that they overlooked. \nLARRY What? You think that the girl is innocent? \nMARTHA I don't know. \nLARRY You got to be crazy. \nLarry pulls out a pack of cigarettes, gives one to Martha and to the prostitute. \nMARTHA Larry... \nLARRY What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case. \nMARTHA Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be. \nLARRY You're too involved Marty. (lights her cigarette) Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else? \nLarry lights his own cigarette and comes over to Martha. \nLARRY (Cont.) I'll ask around, see what I come up with. In the meantime you go home and get some sleep. \nI am saying (distorted) a beautifully simple woman... \nMARTHA An unhappy woman... \nMOTHER MIRIAM She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone. \nMARTHA Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh? \nMARTHA (cont.) Why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Because I am a moral person. \nMARTHA Bullshit! \nMOTHER MIRIAM Bullshit yourself! \nMARTHA Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality... \nMOTHER MIRIAM Who said anything about the Catholic Church... \nMARTHA You just said... \nMOTHER MIRIAM What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you? \nMARTHA Nothing... \nMOTHER MIRIAM What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? \nThis time it is Martha who walks away and Mother Miriam who follows her. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) So instead of questioning that one rule... \nMARTHA (halting) It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run \nover on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Stupid woman... and that's all? \nMARTHA That's all? That's enough!   She was a beautiful little girl. \nMOTHER MIRIAM And what has that to do with it? \nMARTHA I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston. \nMOTHER MIRIAM So you left the Church because you had freckles? \nMARTHA No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles. \nThey both cannot help laughing at this absurdity. \n62   EXT - COURTYARD - DAY \nA couple of nuns walk across the courtyard. Another is meditating alone. On a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away. \n63   EXT - GAZEBO - DAY \nIt is out the back of the convent near the belltower. Mother Miriam and Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking. \nMOTHER MIRIAM When I was a child I used to hear my guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I was six years old. That's when I stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing by \nher window, singing. And all my doubts about \nmyself and God were gone, in that one moment. I recognized the voice. Please don't take it away from me again Doctor Livingston. Those years after six were very bleak. \nMARTHA My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. (a long pause) Does my smoking bother you? \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES Sister Marguerite I think. \nMARTHA Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? (no answer) Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. \nMARTHA (Cont.) Open your eyes. (she opens them) What do you see? \nAGNES My bed. \nMARTHA What else? \nAGNES A crucifix. \nMARTHA Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it? \nAGNES (puzzled) A wastepaper basket. \nMARTHA Do you know who put it there? \nAGNES No. \nMARTHA What do you think it's there for? \nAGNES For me to get sick in. \nMARTHA Are you ill? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA What do you feel? \nAGNES I feel as if I've eaten glass. \nMARTHA What do you do? \nAGNES I have to throw up... \nAnd she falls to her knees, retching horribly. \nAGNES (Cont.) I can't... glass... one of the sisters has fed me glass. \nMARTHA Which one? \nAGNES I don't know which one (distorted) \nMARTHA Of what? \nAGNES Of me. Oh... God! My God... (assumes the birth position and looks between her legs) Water... it's all water... \nMARTHA Why isn't anyone coming? \nAGNES (trying to wipe up the water) They can't hear me that's why. (in terrible pain) Oh God... I don't wanna... \nMOTHER MIRIAM (to Martha) Stop her! \nThen Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of something. \nMARTHA What is it? \nAGNES \nPlease get away from me... \nMARTHA Who? \n67   INT - CRYPT - DAY \nThe crypt is deserted but candles are burning in front of a statue of Saint Michael. Martha walks over to it,lights a candle and goes behind it and finds a stairway there leading underground. She goes down into... \n68   INT - TUNNEL - DAY \nMartha walks through the dimly lit passage. She stops for a moment to look at a cross carved on the stone floor, then continues. Finally she reaches more steps and goes up into the... \n69   INT - BARN - DAY \nMartha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is full of doves. It    begins to make sense for her. \n70   EXT - CITY - DAY \nVarious closeups of famous statues. A bell is tolling. Two nuns come out of a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic did not exist and into another building. \n71   INT - LIFT - DAY \nThe nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam. In the lift an \nOFFICE GIRL checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls. The lift stops and the Sisters get off. \n72   INT - CORRIDOR - DAY \nThey walk down the modern carpeted corridor into... \n73   INT - MARTHA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Is the Doctor in her office? \nHELEN Ah, who shall I say is calling? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (grimly) General MacArthur. \nShe heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her. \nHELEN Just a minute please, you can't go in there. \nMother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha. \nMARTHA (standing) It's... it's alright Helen, just close the door. \nMother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto Martha's desk. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case. \nMARTHA (picking up the papers) You're what? \nMOTHER MIRIAM If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. (starts to leave) \nMARTHA One that will ask the questions you want asked. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (halting) One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect. \nMARTHA For the Church? \nMOTHER MIRIAM For Agnes. \nMARTHA You think she's a saint? \nMOTHER MIRIAM She's been touched by God, yes. \nMARTHA How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I left it with her and I went for help. \nMARTHA I doubt that's what she'd say. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Then she's a liar. \n80   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY \nIt is the same as before, except that this time Martha and Mother Miriam are      standing. \nMARTHA Agnes, can you hear me? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember. \nThere is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes stirs slightly. \nMARTHA (Cont.) What's the matter? \nThere is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying that mysterious word that we could not previously understand. \nAGNES She said Michael. \nMARTHA What did she mean? \nThere is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in the crypt. \nAGNES The statue. She had shown it to me the day before. \nMARTHA And the passage to the barn? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Why? \nAGNES So I could go to him. \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES Him. \nMARTHA How did she know about him? \nAGNES She'd seen him too. \nMARTHA Where? \nAGNES From the belltower the day she before she died. \nMARTHA So she sent you? \nAGNES Yes. \n81   INT - TUNNEL - NIGHT \nIn flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel carrying an oil lamp. \nMARTHA (V.O.) What happened? \nAgnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into... \n82   INT - BARN - NIGHT \nStill in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn. The doves flap about as Agnes    moves nervously through the barn. \nAGNES Stay away from me... \nMARTHA Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand? \nAGNES No... \nMARTHA He    frightened you and he hurt you. It's not    your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who    he is so we can find him. Stop him    from doing this to other women. \nAGNES Not your fault... \nMARTHA Agnes who did you see? \nAGNES I hate him... \nMARTHA Of course you do. Who was it? \nAGNES I hate him for what he did to me. \nMARTHA Yes. \nAGNES For what he made me go through. \nMARTHA Who? \nAGNES I hate him. \nMARTHA Agnes, who did this to you? \nAgnes flings her arms back against the wall. \nAGNES God!  It was God. (sinks to her knees) And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him. \nMARTHA Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him. \nMOTHER MIRIAM That's enough. \nMARTHA Agnes, what happened to the baby? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (shouting) She can't remember. \nMARTHA What happened to the baby? \nAGNES It was dead. \nMARTHA It was alive wasn't it? \nAGNES I don't remember. \nMOTHER MIRIAM (screaming) Oh, don't do this! \nMARTHA Wasn't it! \nAGNES YES! \nSomehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat. Mother Miriam   is looking utterly resigned. \nMARTHA Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she? \nAGNES \nYes. \nMARTHA She took the baby in her arms? \nAGNES Yes. \n", "test1_input": "AGNES I don't know... I don't know... \nMOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets. \n49   INT - SICKROOM - NIGHT \nStill in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where SISTER PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there and many of the other nuns singing hymns. \nMARTHA (V.O.) When was that? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away. \nMARTHA (V.O.) Sister Paul? \nMOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. \nFather Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly slips in   unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say a single silent word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister Paul lies back \nand dies. \n50   INT - CATHEDRAL - DAY \nMartha and the MONSIGNOR are walking through the church talking. He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner. \n(beginning missed) \nMARTHA No. \nMONSIGNOR Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time. \nMARTHA Why do you call it an investigation? I never have. \nMONSIGNOR Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her. \nMARTHA What does this have to do with..? \nMONSIGNOR And you had a sister who died in the convent. \nMARTHA Who told you this? \nMONSIGNOR Do you still go to church? \nMARTHA What business is it of yours..? \nMONSIGNOR Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case. \nMARTHA Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to... \nMONSIGNOR (halting) But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does \nmake all the difference to Agnes. \nMARTHA I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? \nMONSIGNOR Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me. \nMartha stares at him as he walks away. \n51   EXT - CONVENT - DAY \nA single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower. The bell is ringing. \n52   INT - BELLTOWER - DAY \nMother Miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a considerable effort. \n", "test1_true": "Agnes has a wheelbarrow full of straw and manure. She dumps it on a pile. \n54   INT - COWSHED - DAY \nMartha is watching Agnes milking a cow. \nMARTHA Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you. \nAGNES I'm not sick. \nMARTHA But you're troubled... aren't you? \nAGNES That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget. \nMARTHA And you're unhappy. \nAGNES Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't \nyou? \nMARTHA Agnes... \nAGNES Answer me!    You never answer me. \nMARTHA Sometimes, yes. \nAGNES Only you think    you're lucky because you didn't have    a mother who said things to you and did    things to you that maybe weren't always    nice but that was because of me, because    I was bad, not her. \nAgnes carries the milk pail round to the churn. \nMARTHA What did you do? \nAGNES I'm always bad. \nMARTHA What did you do? \nAGNES I breathed! \nAgnes falls to her knees. Martha moves round and kneels in front of her. \nMARTHA Agnes. What did your mother do to you? (no answer) If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? (Anges shakes her head: no) Did she make you do something you didn't want to? (yes) Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? (yes) Did it embarrass you? (yes) Did it... did it hurt you? (yes) What did she make you you do? \nAGNES No... \nMARTHA You can tell me. \nAGNES I can't. \nMARTHA She's dead isn't she? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA She can't hurt you any more. \nAGNES She can. \nMARTHA How? \nAGNES She watches... she listens. \nMARTHA Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her. \nAGNES She... \nMARTHA Yes? \n", "test1_id": 201, "test2_input": "MARTHA The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Would it stop you if I did? \nMARTHA No. \nThey both halt. \nMOTHER MIRIAM May I be present? \nMARTHA Of course. \nMOTHER MIRIAM Then let's begin. \n64   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY \nThe room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply sloping    ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed, already under   hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her. \nMARTHA You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Who am I? \nAGNES Doctor Livingston. \nMARTHA And why am I here? \nAGNES To help me. \nMARTHA Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here? \nAGNES Because I'm in trouble. \nMARTHA What kind of trouble? (no answer) What kind of trouble Agnes? \nMartha starts to walk around behind Agnes. \nAGNES I'm frightened. \nMARTHA Of what? \nAGNES Of telling you. \nMARTHA But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble? \nAGNES (a pause) I had a baby. \nBoth Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of relief. \nMARTHA How did you have a baby? \nAGNES It came out of me. \nMARTHA Did you know what was going to come \nout? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Did you want it to come out? \nAGNES No. \nMARTHA Why? \n", "test2_true": "MARTHA Why were you afraid? \nAGNES Because I wasn't worthy. \nMARTHA To be a mother? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Why? \nAGNES May I open my eyes now? \nMARTHA No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you? \nAGNES It grew. \nMARTHA What made it grow? Do you know? \nAGNES Yes. \nMARTHA Would you like to tell me? \nAGNES No. \nMARTHA Did anyone else know about the baby? \nAGNES \nI can't tell you that. \nMARTHA Will she be angry? \nAGNES She made me promise not to. \nMARTHA Who?     Who made you promise? (no answer) It's    alright Agnes. It's alright. (a pause) Let's    go to your room. It's the night about    six weeks ago when you were very    sick. \nAGNES I'm afraid. \nMARTHA Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed. \nAGNES I ate. \nMARTHA Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner? \nAGNES Fish... (distastefully) ... brussel sprouts. \nMARTHA You don't like brussel sprouts? \nAGNES I hate them. \nMartha and Mother Miriam can't help smiling. \nMARTHA And then what happened? \nAGNES We went to chapel for vespers. \nMARTHA Hm hmm. \nAGNES I left early because I wasn't feeling very well. \nSuddenly Agnes leaps up from her chair. \nMARTHA What is it? \nAGNES Someone's following me. \n", "test2_id": 202, "test3_input": "MARTHA Who was that person Mother?    Was it you? \nMOTHER MIRIAM If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes. \nShe goes out and slams the door. \n74   EXT - POND - DAY \nAfter a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond. They are quite uninhibited, like little children. Their singing (off) from the chapel continues until the end of scene 78. \n75   INT - CHAPEL - DAY \nSister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated. She approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle and kneels down. \n76   INT - LAW COURTS - DAY \nMartha and Justice Leveau come up the steps and into the corridor. \nMARTHA All I want is one more week. \nLEVEAU Why? (continues in French, then...) You've done nothing to show any progress. \nMARTHA Yes, that's because I'm getting to her. \nLEVEAU You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it. \nMARTHA I'll have a decision by next week. \nLEVEAU It's gone on long enough. You're out. \nMARTHA Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby. \nLEVEAU (halting) You have proof? \nMARTHA I'll have it. \nLEVEAU When? \nMARTHA Next week. \nLEVEAU (walking on) No, no, no... \nMARTHA \nI can get you new evidence next week. \nLEVEAU No! \nMARTHA Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will. \nThey reach the door of Leveau's office. He thinks... \nLEVEAU Yes, demain (?) \n77   INT - CHAPEL - DAY \nThe scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop, Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family (4) watching from behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her, running out to join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this time the nuns singing along from    behind the gate. \n78   EXT - CONVENT - DAY \nMartha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow covered grounds to    the convent. \n79   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S OFFICE - DAY \nMother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun interrupts. Singing   from the party can faintly be heard. \n", "test3_true": "Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he door. Martha hands    her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly and hands it back. \nMOTHER MIRIAM This is permission to take her apart. \nMARTHA Where is she? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Hasn't she had enough? \nMARTHA I have a few more questions to ask her. \nMOTHER MIRIAM My God, but you're determined. \nThey move back into the room. \nMARTHA Who knew she was pregnant? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Why do you insist upon pressing... \nMARTHA Was it you? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Is it because she's a nun? \nMARTHA Did you know she was pregnant? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Yes. \nMARTHA And you didn't send her to a doctor. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I didn't guess until it was too late. \nMARTHA For what?     An abortion? \nMOTHER MIRIAM Oh, don't be ridiculous. \nMARTHA Too late for what? \nMOTHER MIRIAM I don't know... too late to stop it. \nMARTHA The baby? \nMOTHER MIRIAM The scandal... \nMARTHA You went to the room to help with the birth. \nMOTHER MIRIAM She didn't want any help. \nMARTHA \nYou wanted that child out of the way. \nMOTHER MIRIAM That's a lie. \nMARTHA You hid the wastepaper basket in her room. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets. \nMARTHA And the baby. \nMOTHER MIRIAM No! \nMARTHA You tied the cord around its neck. \nMOTHER MIRIAM I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked. \nMARTHA Before or after you killed the child? \n", "test3_id": 203}

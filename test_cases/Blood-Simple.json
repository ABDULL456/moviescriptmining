{"train": "Blood Simple \n\"BLOOD SIMPLE\" \nBy \nJoel Coen and Ethan Coen \nLANDSCAPES \nAn opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas landscapes--broad, bare, and lifeless. \nVOICE-OVER The world is full of complainers. But the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee. I don't care if you're the Pope of Rome, President of the United States, or even Man of the Year--something can always go wrong. And go ahead, complain, tell your problems to your neighbor, ask for help--watch him fly. Now in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else-- that's the theory, anyway. But what I know about is Texas... \nCUT TO \nROAD  NIGHT \nWe are rushing down a rain-swept country road, listening to the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt. \nVOICE-OVER And down here... you're on your own. \nINT. CAR NIGHT \nWe are looking at the backs of two people in the front seat-- a man, driving, and a woman next to him. \nTheir conversation will be punctuated by the occasional glare of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing by. \nThe windshield wipers wave a soporific beat. The conversation is halting, awkward. \nWOMAN ...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary. \nMAN Uh-huh. \nWOMAN ...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him. \nMAN Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him. \nWOMAN Yeah... \nPause, as an oncoming car passes. Finally: \nWOMAN ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think? \nMAN Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you... \nAnother car passes. \nMAN ...What're you gonna do in Houston? \nWOMAN I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess? \nMAN I told you. I like you. \nWOMAN See, I never knew that. \nMAN Well now you do. \nWOMAN ...Hell. \nAnother pause. Another car. \nSuddenly: \nWOMAN Stop the car, Ray! \nCLOSE SHOT BRAKE \nStamped on. \nEXT. CAR \nLow three-quarters on the car as it squeals to a halt. \nA car that has been following screeches to a halt just behind it. \nBoth cars sit. \nRain patters. \nINT. FIRST CAR \nClose on the man, from behind. \nHe looks at the woman. \nRAY Yeah. \nABBY What was that? \nRAY Your husband. \nBAR BACK OFFICE  NIGHT \nWe are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has just been slapped down on the desktop. \nThe picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the motel room. \nVOICE I know a place you can get that framed. \nThe voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie. \nWe cut to him. \nHe is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. He is LOREN VISSER, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow leisure suit. \nHe smiles at the man behind the desk. \nJULIAN MARTY \nSits staring down at the photograph. Behind him a window opens on the bar proper. Country-western music filters in from the bar. \nMarty is not pleased. \nMARTY What did you take these for? \nVISSER What do you mean... \nHe removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette. \nVISSER ...Just doin' my job. \nMARTY You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for? \nVISSER Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit. \nMARTY How long did you watch her? \nVISSER Most of the night... \nHe lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop. \nIt is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out \"Loren\" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is \"Elks Man of the Year.\" \nVISSER ...They'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again. Quite something. \nMarty stares down at the photograph. \nMARTY You know in Greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news. \nA smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen. \nVISSER Now that don't make much sense. \nMARTY No. It just made them feel better. \nMarty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk. \nVisser laughs as he watches Marty. \nVISSER Well first off, Julian, I don't know what the story is in Greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that... \nMarty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope. \nVISSER ...Second place I ain't a messenger, I'm a private investigator. And third place--and most important--it ain't such bad news. I mean you thought he was a colored. (he laughs) ...You're always assumin' the worst... \nVisser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at Marty. \nVISSER ...Anything else? \nMARTY Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over. \nMarty scales the pay envelope across the desk. It hits Visser in the chest and bounces to the floor. \nVisser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat. Then he roars with laughter. \nVISSER That's good... \"which rock to turn over\"... that's very good... \nSighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. He rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot. \nVISSER Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head... \nMARTY Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line? \nDEBRA I don't follow baseball. \nMarty laughs. \nMARTY You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is. \nDEBRA You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew. \nMarty smiles bleakly. Debra drains her glass as Meurice returns. He sets another Cognac in front of Debra, and a glass of milk in front of Marty. \nMARTY What's this? \nMEURICE You said the usual-- \nMARTY Red Label. \nMEURICE (picking up the milk) Right. Sorry. \nMARTY Pour that back. \nMEURICE What. \nMARTY Don't throw that out. \nMEURICE Right. \nHe wanders on down the bar; Marty's attention returns to the woman. \nMARTY So how long have you know Meurice? \nDEBRA About ten years. \nMarty's attention is caught by something down the bar. He half-rises from his stool. \nMARTY What--Waitaminute--What... \nHIS POV \nMeurice is pouring the milk down the sink. He looks innocently up. \nMEURICE What. \nBACK TO MARTY \nAngry but not knowing what to say. He glances around the bar, sinks slowly back onto his stool. \nMARTY Deuce in the corner needs help. \nMEURICE Right. \nMarty sits staring across the bar for a moment, nods a couple of times at nothing in particular, then looks back at the woman. \nMARTY ...So what're you doing tonight? \nDEBRA Going out with Meurice. \nMarty tosses a beer nut into his mouth. \nMARTY Tell him you have a headache. \nDebra gives him a level stare. \nDEBRA It'll pass. \nMARTY We don't seem to be communicating-- \nDEBRA You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave? \nMARTY I own the place. \nDEBRA Christ, I'm getting bored. \nMARTY I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years. \nThey both fall silent as Meurice enters frame. He takes a bottle from the bar and pours himself a drink. \nMARTY What's this? \nMEURICE What. \nMARTY (pointing at Meurice's drink) This. \nMEURICE Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it. \nMARTY'S FRONT FOYER \nWe are looking across a dark, high-ceilinged foyer toward the front door. Ray leans against the doorjamb, in silhouette in the open doorway. He is facing a curved staircase that descends into the foyer. Abby appears at the second-floor landing and starts down the stairs. \nRAY Why d'you wanna leave all this? \nABBY You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty... \nAs she reaches the bottom of the stairs: \nABBY ...Drive me to a motel? \nRAY You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there. \nABBY Where... where you going? \nRAY See a guy. \nABBY (nervously) Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea. \nRAY I just gotta see a guy. \nMARTY'S BAR \nThe crowd has thinned out. Meurice and Debra are in the foreground. \nRay enters from the street and makes his way over to them. \nMEURICE Howdy stranger. \nRAY Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night. \nMEURICE Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea... \nHe pours Debra another drink and starts to set one up for Ray. \nMEURICE ...Ray, this is Debra. She's a geologist. That's the theory of rocks. \nRay nods at Debra. \nRAY Is Marty here? \nMEURICE Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office. \nRAY (leaving) Thanks Meurice. \nMEURICE For what? \nEXT. BACK OF MARTY'S BAR \nMarty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his back office to a graveled back parking lot; he is framed in the open doorway of his brightly lit office. He stares fixedly at something offscreen. \nMARTY'S POV \nIn the middle distance a huge incinerator operates full blast. Orange flames lick out the sides; white smoke billows out the top. Two figures in silhouette are chucking garbage in through a large gate. \nBACK TO MARTY \nBehind him, in the office, we see the door from the bar open, and Ray entering. \nRAY Marty? \nMarty looks over his shoulder, then back toward the furnace. Ray descends the stoop and stands in front of him. \nRAY ...Well...? What? \nMarty stares past Ray across the parking lot. \nMARTY What \"what\"? \nRAY Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What? \nMARTY I don't particularly want to talk to you. \nRAY Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit. \nMARTY Fine. Suit yourself. (still staring fixedly at the furnace) ...Having a good time? \nRay tenses. There is a pause. \nRAY ...I don't like this kind of talk. \nMarty still stares at the furnace. \nMARTY Then what'd you come here for? \nMARTY'S OFFICE \nMarty listens. He says nothing, still tilted back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. \nRAY'S LIVING ROOM \nAbby listens. She shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard to the sound of the fan. There is another long pause. \nABBY ...Marty? \nThe phone goes dead just as we hear the front door opening. Abby looks up as she cradles the phone. \nRay is standing in the doorway. \nRAY Who was it? \nABBY What? \nRAY On the phone. Was it for you? \nABBY I don't know, he didn't say anything. \nRAY Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he? \nABBY (smiling) You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here? \nRay leans against the door and folds his arms, watching Abby. \nRAY No, am I? \nAbby looks at him, puzzled. After an uncomfortable pause: \nABBY ...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair. \nRAY If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch? \nAbby shifts uneasily, looking at Ray. \nABBY Well... the couch would be all right... \nRAY You can sleep on the bed if you want. \nABBY Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed... \nRAY You wouldn't be putting me out. \nABBY ...Well, I'd be okay in here-- \nRay walks toward the bedroom. \nRAY Okay. \nMARTY'S OFFICE  LATER \nStill tilted back in his chair, Marty stares glumly at the ceiling. The bar itself is completely still except the rhythmic whir of the fan. \nCLOSE SHOT  A CEILING FAN \nTurning slowly. We tilt down from the fan to frame Abby, lying under a sheet on Ray's couch, staring up at the fan in the darkened living room. The room is still. We hear only the whir of the fan and the distant sound of crickets. Abby turns her head, looking offscreen. \nHER POV \nA ray of light slants up the hallway from the direction of the bedroom. The light is snapped off, leaving the hallway in darkness. We hear a faint cough and the creaking of bedsprings. \nRAY'S BEDROOM \nRay lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. \nRAY'S LIVING ROOM / HALLWAY \nLONG SHOT  THE LIVING ROOM  FROM THE HALLWAY \nAbby sits up. She stands and walks across the moonlit room toward the hallway. We pull her back down the hall toward the bedroom. She pauses in the bedroom doorway and looks down toward the bed. \nABBY'S POV \nRay in bed, his eyes closed. \nBACK TO ABBY \nWe pull her as she enters the room, then tilt down with her as she hesitantly sits on the edge of the bed. \nABBY'S POV \nClose shot, Ray asleep. \nBACK TO MARTY \nBacking toward his car, a Cadillac parked at curbside, still looking at Ray. He turns to get into the car. \nThe German shepherd lopes across the lawn and takes a clean leap into the car through the open window on the passenger side. \nMarty turns the ignition. The engine coughs and dies. He tries again; it starts. \nThe car roars up the street. \nRAY \nWatching the car. He looks at Abby. \nABBY \nStill panting. Up the street we can hear Marty's car alternately racing and stopping, shifting in and out of gear. His engine rumble starts to grow louder again. \nRAY Like to have seen his face when he found the dead end. \nIn the background we see Marty's car roar by in the opposite direction. \nMOUNT BONNEL  EVENING \nLATERAL TRACK \nMoving past a row of cars parked on an overlook near the top of the mountain. Below we can see the lights of the city of Austin. The lot is littered with beer cans. We hear the sound of rock music coming from various car radios. Several teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars we can see the vague forms of others. \nTEENAGER Hey mister, how'd you break your pussyfinger? \nHis friends laugh. \nTRACK PULLING MARTY \nIgnoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently looking for someone. His right index finger is taped up in an aluminum splint. \nMARTY'S POV \nAt the end of a row of cars we see a green Volkswagon bug. Leaning against the hood is Visser, still dressed in his rumpled yellow suit. He is smoking a cigarette, talking to a sixteen-year-old girl in shorts and a tube top. When he notices Marty: \nVISSER (to the girl) Sorry sweetheart, my date is here... \nThe girl drifts off. Marty enters frame and Visser turns to him. \nVISSER ...She saw me rolling a cigarette and thought it was marijuana. (he laughs) I guess she thought I was a swinger. \nVisser open the back door of the car. Marty ignores the invitation, walks around to the front on the passenger side and gets in. \nINT. VISSER'S CAR \nAs Visser gets into the driver's seat. A small topless doll is suspended from the rearview mirror. Visser gives it a tap. As it swings back and forth two small lights, one behind each breast, blink on and off. \nVISSER Idnat wild? \nBoth men sit watching the doll intently. \nFinally Marty reaches up and stops its swinging with the rounded end of his splint. Visser eyes the splint. \nVISSER (genially) Stick your finger up the wrong person's ass? \nMarty is silent, but Visser is in a good mood. \nVISSER You know a friend of mine broke his hand a while back. Put in a cast. Very next day he takes a fall, protects his bad hand, falls on his good one, breaks that too. So now he's got two busted flippers and I say to him \"Creighton, I hope your wife loves you. 'Cause for the next five weeks you cannot wipe your own goddamn ass...\" \nOvercome by laughter. Finally: \nVISSER ...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love-- \nMARTY Got a job for you. \nVISSER (settling down) ...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it. \nMARTY It's not strictly legal. \nVisser shrugs, lights up another cigarette with his fraternally inscribed lighter and drops the lighter onto the dashboard. \nVISSER If the pay's right I'll do it. \nMARTY It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get. \nVISSER Yeah? Well how irritated are you? \nMarty doesn't answer. Finally Visser laughs. \nVISSER ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret? \nLANDLADY (cheerful again) I show you around. \nWe follow Abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the short hallway-entrance foyer. Abby glances back at the old man. \nABBY Are you sure this is... Are you sure this apartment is vacant?... Mrs. Esteves? \nThe Landlady laughs cheerfully. \nLANDLADY Oh yes... \nShe gestures to a kitchen alcove on the left. \nLANDLADY ...That's the kitchen... \nShe turns and throws a few more barbs in Spanish back toward the old man, then opens a door on the right side of the foyer and enters the bathroom. \nLANDLADY ...This is the bathroom... \nShe flushes the toilet. \nLANDLADY ...The toilet works and everytheen... \nShe bustles out of the bathroom and takes the two short steps back into the main room. She gestures expansively. \nLANDLADY ...And here we are back in the liveen room. \nShe gives one vigorous stomp. \nLANDLADY ...Good floors. Gas heat. \nShe points. \nLANDLADY ...That's Mr. Garcia. \nThe old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking a cigarette, looking for a place to put the ash. The Landlady snaps at him again in Spanish, and is again cheerful as she turns back to address Abby. \nLANDLADY ...I was just esplaineen to him that he moved out of here yesterday... \nShe walks to the apartment door. \nLANDLADY ...You look around. Don't mind Mr. Garcia; he use do be my brother-in- law. \nShe walks out and shuts the door. \nThe room is quiet. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStaring at the door. She looks at Mr. Garcia, looks nervously around the apartment. She looks back at Mr. Garcia. \nCLOSE SHOT  MR. GARCIA \nStaring vacantly at Abby. He blows a stream of smoke across the room. The ash falls off his cigarette. \nSTRIP BAR  NIGHT \nEXHORTER'S CUBICLE \nHunched over the public address microphone in his small cubicle of exhortation, is the middle-aged strip-bar barker. Years of service in the bar have left his exhortations depressingly bereft of conviction. \nEXHORTER How 'bout it, gentlemen, let's show out appreciation for Lorraine up there, a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas, how 'bout it gentlemen, yeah... \nTHE BAR PROPER \nMeurice is one of a line of men sitting at the bar, all looking intently at the same point off left. All of the men except Meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently well-to-do. An audio loop is blaring a bump-and-grind version of \"Yellow Rose of Texas,\" punctuated by the crash of cymbals and the thumping of toms. \nAbby enters and sits into an empty chair next to Meurice. \nABBY Looks like the state legislature is out of session. \nMeurice continues to stare intently off. \nMEURICE I thought this is where they met. \nAll of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including Meurice's. A couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks off the bar. \nIn the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of the bar into frame. We crop her just above her white high- heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves. \nThe conversation continues with Abby looking at Meurice, but Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point somewhere above the stripper's calves. \nABBY Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem. \nMEURICE I am? \nThe stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in the foreground. The audience cheers. \nRAY (sleepily) ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly. \nABBY Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much. \nHIGH ANGLE  RAY \nHis eyes half-closed. \nRAY Uh-huh. \nABBY I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist? \nRAY What'd he say? \nSIDE ANGLE  ABBY \nFramed against the window. \nABBY Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much. \nRAY (murmuring) Thanks. \nABBY Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty. \nRAY ...Mm-hmm. \nABBY When you don't they're usually nice. \nRAY ...You ever get tired? \nABBY Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm. \nRay's hand rises into frame and coaxes Abby back down onto the bed, revealing, through the window, a green Volkswagon now parked at curbside on the lamplit street. \nWe hear the rustle of sheets. \nAs we hold on the window, we begin to hear the faint, distant sound of metal scraping against metal. \nHALLWAY / LIVING ROOM \nWe track down the dark hallway into the living room. As the camera advances the sound of the scraping becomes louder. \nWe are moving across the living room up to the front door of the bungalow. The scraping is louder still as we finally frame on a close shot of the doorknob, which is jiggling ever so slightly. \nWe hear a click as the lock finally releases. \nThe door swings slowly open, revealing a man's hand on the outside doorknob. We follow the hand as the man advances slowly and quietly across the living room. \nAbby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to it is a large tote bag. The hand rummages through the tote bag briefly, then the purse. The man withdraws Abby's pearl- handled revolver. He breaks it open. \nLOW-ANGLE CLOSE SHOT  THE MAN'S FACE \nIt is Visser. As we hear a click offscreen, his face glows a dim orange. \nBACK TO HIS HANDS \nHis right holds the revolver, cylinder open, inside the purse. His left holds his cigarette lighter as he inspects the chamber. Three of the holes glint silver, the other three are black--empty. \nWe hear the faint creaking of bedsprings. \nWIDE SHOT  LIVING ROOM \nVisser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway. He takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the bungalow. \nWe follow him outside onto the lawn. \nEXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW \nWe track behind him as he rounds the corner of the house and approaches the open window to Ray's bedroom. He slows, moves more cautiously, then sinks to his knees under the window. As he reaches into his breast pocket the camera continues tracking up to and over him, finally framing his POV through the window. \nOn the bed inside we can dimly see Abby and Ray, asleep. \nWe have been hearing a faint rumble, becoming louder and louder as if approaching from a distance. Just as the rumble becomes deafening a sudden bright flash of light illuminates the room, seeming to polarize the image of Abby and Ray in bed, and we: \nCUT TO \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH DAY \nA huge truck roars by on the street behind Visser, and with it the deafening rumble recedes. It is a painfully bright day. Visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the receiver pressed to his ear. We hear the phone ringing at the other end. \nFinally, it is picked up. \nVOICE Hello. \nVISSER Marty? \nVISSER'S POV \nThe standing safe behind the desk. \nBACK TO VISSER \nStill looking at the safe. Beads of sweat have popped out on his forehead. He fans himself with his cowboy hat. \nVISSER ...and you did say somethin' about some money. \nWe hear a toilet flush offscreen. \nLONG SHOT  MARTY'S OFFICE \nAs he reenters the office. \nMARTY Your money, yeah. \nVisser stares dully down at the desktop. \nVISSER Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful? \nMARTY Of course. \nVISSER Nobody knows you hired me? \nHIGH ANGLE  CORNER OF THE OFFICE \nMarty is hunched over the open safe, still holding the envelope. Blocking Visser's view of the safe with his body, he slides the picture of Abby's and Ray's corpses from under the envelope into the safe, then withdraws two packets of money. \nMARTY Don't be absurd, I wasn't about to tell anyone... \nHe shuts the safe and spins the dial. \nMARTY ...This is an illicit romance--we've got to trust each other to be discreet... \nHe walks across the room and throws the money and the envelope down on the desk. \nMARTY ...For richer, for poorer. \nVisser looks from the money down at his hands. They are sweating. \nVISSER Don't say that. Your marriages don't work out so hot... \nHe wipes his hands on his pants. \nVISSER ...How did you cover the money? \nMarty sits and props his booted feet up on the desk. \nMARTY It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better. \nHe smiles. \nMARTY ...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. \nVISSER (shaking his head) I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder... \nHe nods toward the envelope on the desk. \nVISSER ...it's too damn risky. \nMARTY Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways. \nHe pushes the money across the desk with his boot. \nMARTY ...Count it if you want. \nVISSER (reaching into his coat) Nah, I trust ya. \nHis hand comes out with a gun pointing at Marty and--BAM--he fires, an orange lick of flame spurting from the gun. \nBoth men sit frozen. Visser's hand is the only thing that moved. \nCLOSE SHOT  MARTY \nStaring at Visser. \nAfter the gun blast we hear only the whir of the fan. \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER \nStaring at Marty. \nMED SHOT  MARTY  OVER VISSER'S SHOULDER \nHe stumbles slightly and we hear the sharp blast of a gun and the sound of something metallic skating across the floor. \nRay, startled, steadies himself against the desk, then studies Marty. \nRAY'S POV \nThere is a dark pool of blood under Marty's chair. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe looks back up at Marty, then walks behind his chair and throws a wall switch. The room is bathed in light. His eyes still on Marty, Ray crosses behind the desk. \nRAY'S POV  TRACKING SHOT \nThe camera moves in a slow arc around the back of Marty's motionless head. \nBACK TO RAY \nStill moving. He looks away from Marty, scans the floor. He gets down on his hands and knees and peers under the safe. \nRAY'S POV \nThere is a glinting silver circle in the darkness under the safe. It is the business end of the revolver that Ray half- stumbled over, half-kicked. \nBACK TO RAY \nStill on his hands and knees. He reaches in and we hear a rattle as he gropes under the safe. He withdraws the gun, looks at it. \nTHE GUN \nIt is Abby's revolver. \nBACK TO RAY \nFor a long moment he doesn't move. Then, slowly, he starts to get up. \nWIDER \nThe desk, Marty behind it, Ray straightening behind him. Ray looks from the gun to Marty, slowly sets the gun down on the desk. A pause. He begins to hoist Marty from the chair. \nThere is noise from the bar, as of someone entering. \nRay reacts. \nTHE DOOR \nSeparating the bar and back office. Ray hurries to it. \nMEURICE (O.S.) Marty? \nFootsteps approach the door. \nEXTREME CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S HAND ON THE DOOR BOLT \nHe turns it gently. The bolt clicks shut. \nBACK TO RAY \nMeurice's footsteps draw nearer. \nMEURICE (O.S.) Marty, ya home? \nThere is a rap at the door; Ray stands frozen. The doorknob rattles. Ray reaches out compulsively to grab it, but stops himself before actually touching it. \nNow Meurice's footsteps can be heard going casually back into the bar. We hold on Ray's rigidly set face. \nMEURICE (O.S.) What day is it today, Angie? \nWOMAN (O.S.) Tuesday. \nMEURICE (O.S.) Tuesday is ladies' night. \nWOMAN (O.S.) What? \nMEURICE (O.S.) Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free. \nWe hear a record drop on the jukebox and a Motown song blares. \nRay crosses to Marty's chair and takes off his nylon windbreaker. He stoops down and tries to mop up the pool of blood with his windbreaker. This isn't going to work. \nHe rises and walks over to the bathroom, the windbreaker dripping blood. \nMARTY'S OFFICE BATHROOM \nCLOSE SHOT  FAUCET \nRAY'S POV  TRACKING \nToward the car. Still no sign of movement. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe slows as he draws up to the back of the car. He looks in the back window. \nRAY'S POV  BACK SEAT OF THE CAR \nIt is empty. \nThe door on the highway side is ajar. \nBACK TO RAY \nNo reaction. \nHe walks around the back of the car onto the highway. He looks up the road. \nRAY'S POV \nMarty is crawling up the road on his hands and knees, leaving a trail of blood. The headlights of Ray's car give a fantastically long shadow. \nBACK TO RAY \nStill no reaction. He gets into the driver's seat and stares through the windshield as he gropes for the ignition key. \nRAY'S POV \nMarty, crawling. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe throws the car into drive, looks at his target, thinks-- decides. He pulls the key out of the ignition and goes around to the trunk of the car. He opens it and pulls out a shovel. \nMARTY  LOW ANGLE \nFrom in front. The headlights glare behind him. His breath vaporizes. In the background Ray is walking toward him, dragging the shovel, which scrapes along the asphalt. As Ray moves into the foreground and turns to face Marty only his lower legs and the shovel are in frame. \nThe shovel rises out of frame. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY \nBoth hands hold the shovel tensed over his shoulder. He stares down at Marty. A long pause. We hear a distant rumble. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FEET \nInches away from Marty. Marty's hand slides forward and wraps around one of Ray's ankles. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe shudders. He adjusts his grip on the shovel. \nThe rumble grows louder. \nRAY'S FEET \nHe jerks his foot away, breaking Marty's grasp. \nBACK TO RAY \nLooks up from Marty. The rumble grows louder. \nRAY'S POV \nHeadlight beams, although not yet the headlights themselves, are visible a long way down the road. \nBACK TO RAY \nStaring down the road. Finally he lowers the shovel, walks back to the car and throws it viciously into the trunk, walks back up into the foreground and stoops down. \nCLOSE SHOT  MARTY \nAs Ray grabs him under the armpits and starts dragging him back to the car. Just before Ray heaves him into the back seat, Marty coughs weakly. A fine spray of blood comes out with the cough. \nThe engine rumble is quite loud now. \nMED SHOT  RAY  FROM ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE CAR \nAs he slams the back door shut. He presses himself against the side of the car. Headlights glare over him; the truck roars by just behind him. \nEXT. OPEN FIELD \nFULL SHOT  RAY'S CAR \nMED SHOT  RAY \nWorking furiously. His breath comes in short gasps. \nHIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE \nIt is filled. Ray is packing down the earth, slamming the shovel furiously against the bare patch of earth. \nCLOSE SHOT  THE BLADE OF THE SHOVEL \nBeing slammed down against the earth. Again and again. \nEXT. OPEN FIELD  SUNRISE \nThe staccato beat of the shovel slamming against earth drops out at the cut. There is perfect quiet. The sun is just peeping over the horizon. In the foreground Ray is sitting in the open door of his car, smoking a cigarette. His gaze is fixed on a spot offscreen. \nHIS POV \nA house. Quite near by. \nThe house and its perfect green rectangle of lawn are set incongruously in the middle of the open field. \nBACK TO RAY \nStaring, without emotion. \nHe takes one last, fierce drag on the cigarette, then flicks it away. He takes the shovel, walks over to the grave and stares at it for several seconds, shovel clasped firmly in both hands. \nHe walks back to the car. \nHIGH SHOT \nHouse, car and grave. Ray throws the shovel into the car, gets in, and turns the ignition. \nThe engine coughs weakly and dies. \nHe tries again. Same result. \nOne more time. The engine coughs, sputters, and fires to life. The car runs over the grave and rattles on across the rutted field towards the highway in the distance. \nINT. RAY'S CAR  DAWN \nAs Ray drives down the straight empty highway in the flat early-morning light. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY \nPale and unblinking. \nRAY'S POV  THE HIGHWAY \nIn the distance we see a beat-up white station wagon approaching. It's headlights wink on, then off again. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe squints at the approaching car. \nRAY'S POV \nThe car is closer. It's headlights wink again. \nBACK TO RAY \nHis jaw tightens. He stares intently at the car. Then, abruptly, he looks down at his dashboard. \nCLOSE SHOT  HEADLIGHT KNOB ON THE DASHBOARD \nHis headlights are on. Ray's hand enters frame and pushes in the knob. \nSIDE ANGLE  RAY \nWatching the approaching station wagon. As it passes we catch a glimpse of its occupant. He grins and cocks a you-got-it finger at Ray before roaring out of frame. \nEXT. DESERTED GAS STATION \nHIGH ANGLE \nThe station hasn't opened yet. Ray's car, empty, stands alone in the lot. Flat prairie stretches to the horizon. No movement in the frame. \nAt the cut we hear the faint sound of a phone ringing through a receiver. After four or five rings the phone is picked up and we begin a slow crane down. \nABBY (through phone; sleepily) Hello? \nRAY (present; very hoarsely) Abby... you all right? \nABBY Ray?... What time is it? \nRAY (groggy) I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right? \nABBY Yeah... \nShe walks over and sits down on the bed. \nABBY ...You called me this morning. \nRAY Yeah. \nAbby looks at him, expecting more. Finally: \nRAY ...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads. \nABBY ...What do you mean? \nRay finally looks directly at her. \nRAY I know about it, Abby. I went to the bar last night. \nAbby is looking at him in alarm. \nABBY What happened?--Was Meurice there? \nRAY Yeah. \nHe laughs shortly. \nRAY ...He didn't see me, though. Nobody saw me. \nThe chair grates back as he stands up and looks vaguely around the room. \nRAY ...Is it cold in here? \nAbby is looking at him nervously. \nABBY Well... what happened? \nRAY I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important... \nHe starts nervously pacing around the room, looking for something. \nRAY ...What's important is what we do now; I mean we can't go around half- cocked. What we need is some time to think about this, figure it out... \nHe moves a packing crate aside, still hunting around the apartment. \nRAY ...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart. \nABBY Ray-- \nRAY Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead... \nRay's pacing is more agitated as he looks distractedly around the apartment. \nRAY ...because if he's not dead he's gonna get up and try and kill you. \nHe pauses, seemingly at a total loss. \nRAY ...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker? \nABBY What the hell happened, Ray? \nRay is walking to the window. Sunlight streams in around him. \nRAY That ain't important. What's important is that we did it. That's the only thing that matters. We both did it for each other... \nHe stoops down to look through a pile of clothes by the window. \nRAY ...That's what's important. \nABBY I don't know what you're talking about. \nRay's head snaps around. Staring at her he slowly rises to his feet and then remains still. \nABBY I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny. \nRAY ...What was that? \nAbby, startled, can't contain her agitation anymore. \nABBY (rapidly) Ray, I mean you ain't even acting like yourself. First you call me at five in the A.M. saying all kinds of nice things over the telephone and then you come charging in here scaring me half to death without even telling me what it is I'm supposed to be scared of. I gotta tell you it's extremely rattling. \nRAY \nWe track toward him, isolating him against the window. He is perfectly still. For a long time he can't speak. \nStaring. \nABBY'S POV \nThe dead fish. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe seems to be falling slowly backwards. The camera falls with her, keeping her in close shot. Her head hits a pillow. We pull back slowly to reveal that she is lying on the bed in her apartment, staring across the room. She lies motionless on the bad, her eyes wide. \nABBY'S POV \nAcross the darkened apartment we see the curtainless windows, and beyond them, across the lamplit street, the facade of the opposite building. \nLONG SHOT  ABBY \nLying still. After a moment she gets out of bed, crosses to the front door of the apartment, locks it, then walks unsteadily back to the bed. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nSAME LONG SHOT  ABBY IN BED \nShe opens her eyes, lies still for a moment, coughs. She gets out of bed and walks across the still dark apartment to the bathroom. She shuts the bathroom door. \nBATHROOM \nAbby looks at herself in the mirror above the sink, then turns on the tap water. From a neighboring apartment we hear a dull rhythmic thumping on the wall. She pauses, listens for a moment, then starts to splash water on her face. \nFrom somewhere offscreen we hear the sharp sound of glass shattering. It reverberates for a moment, then dies. Abby looks up at the bathroom door. We hear a scraping at the lock of her apartment door. Abby listens. \nSuddenly we hear the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStartled. She shuts off the water and stands motionless. Droplets of water are streaming down her face. \nWe hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, crunching across broken glass. \nABBY Ray...? \nThere is no answer. After a moment we hear bedsprings creak in the next room. Abby opens the bathroom door and walks out. \nMAIN ROOM \nA shaft of light slices across the floor from the open bathroom door. Broken glass glints on the floor. In the semi- darkness we can see that someone is sitting on the bed. The person looks up. \nIt is Marty. \nAbby recoils. \nMARTY Lover-boy oughta lock his door. \nAbby looks nervously at Marty. Droplets of water are still running down her face. She brushes one from her eye. \nMARTY I love you... \nHe smiles thinly. \nMARTY ...That's a stupid thing to say, right? \nAbby takes a step back. \nABBY I... I love you too. \nStill smiling, Marty shakes his head. \nMARTY No. You're just saying that because you're scared... \nHe stands. We hear glass under his feet. He unbuttons the middle button of his coat and reaches inside. \nMARTY ...You left your weapon behind. \nHe withdraws something from an inside pocket and tosses it to her. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY'S HANDS \nAs she catches the object. It is her compact. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nShe looks from her hands up to Marty. \nMARTY He'll kill you too. \nRay shakes his head, smiling. Abby squints at him, looking for help. \nABBY ...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found-- \nRAY With your gun?... \nHe puts the knife in his pocket and walks over to the door. As he approaches her: \nRAY ...Nobody broke in, Abby. I'll tell you the truth... \nRay faces Abby in front of the door. \nRAY ...Truth is, I've felt sick the last couple of days. Can't eat... Can't sleep... When I try to I... Abby... \nIt's difficult to bring out. Ray's hand gropes for the cross- slat on the screen door. Finally: \nRAY ...The truth is... he was alive when I buried him. \nAbby stares. \nAn object materializes in the sky beyond them. It is flipping end-over-end in slow motion, moving toward Abby and Ray and the screen door. Abby and Ray, each staring at the other, fail to notice until-- \nTHWACK--it bounces off the screen. \nAbby starts; Ray doesn't. \nThe spell is broken, Abby pushes hesitantly at the screen door. Ray's hand slides off the cross-slat; he makes no move to stop her. \nCLOSE SHOT  THE FRONT STOOP \nAs Abby steps over the rolled-up newspaper that hit the screen door. \nTRACKING SHOT  ON ABBY \nHurrying down the driveway to get to her car. A low rumble is building on the soundtrack. Abby glances at Ray's car as she passes it. \nABBY'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD  THE CAR \nMore blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering the back seat. The bass rumble grows louder, punctuated by a rhythmic thumping. \nEXT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT  DAY \nOVER ABBY'S SHOULDER \nAs she pounds frantically on the door--the sound continuing over the cut. After a moment the door edges open. \nMeurice is standing in the doorway in a long bathrobe. A sleeper's blindfold is pushed up over his forehead. \nMEURICE Abby. What's the matter? \nABBY I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in? \nHe looks at her hard. \nMEURICE Yeah... yeah, come in... \nHe steps aside to let her pass. \nMEURICE ...but I gotta tell ya... \nINT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT \nAs Abby enters. \nMEURICE ...I'm retired. \nMeurice switches on a table lamp; the curtains are drawn against the sun. Abby follows Meurice over to the bar. \nMEURICE Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink? \nABBY No, I-- \nMEURICE Well I do... \nHe pours himself a drink. \nMEURICE ...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired. \nABBY Something happened with Marty and Ray-- \nMEURICE (sharply) Abby... \nHe glares at her. \nMEURICE ...Let me ask you one question... \nMED SHOT  ABBY \nSitting on the sofa, looking down out of frame. Behind her Meurice agitatedly paces back and forth, waving the splintered bottom half of the cue stick. His voice is unnaturally loud. \nMEURICE ...Something pretty fucking weird is going on. Put your coat on and I'll drop you at home. But don't talk to either of 'em until I do. And don't worry. Believe me. These things always have a logical explanation. Usually. \nABBY'S POV \nThe splintered top half of the cue stick on the coffee table. \nINT. ABBY'S HALLWAY \nAbby approaches her door in the foreground and lets herself in. \nINT. ABBY'S APARTMENT \nLooking toward the window. The room is dark. Through the window we see the facade of the building across the street. Abby enters frame in the foreground, in silhouette against the window, and throws an overhead light switch. The bright light reveals Ray standing by the window, looking out. \nRAY (abruptly) Turn it off. \nAbby jumps, startled. \nABBY Ray... \nEXT. ROOF OF FACING APARTMENT BUILDING \nFrom the roof of the building across the street we are looking down on the facade of Abby's building. Most of its windows are dark, but in a brightly lit fourth-floor window we can clearly see Abby and Ray. \nA man is on the roof in the foreground, hitching a rifle to his shoulder. \nINT. ABBY'S APARTMENT \nRay turns from the window which, with the switching on of the overhead light, has become a mirror of the interior of the apartment. \nRAY Just turn it off. \nEXT. FACING ROOF \nThe light goes out in the apartment across the street; its window goes opaque. \nINT. ABBY'S APARTMENT \nDark now. Ray still stands by the window, looking out. Abby still stands by the light switch. \nRAY (answering a question) No curtains on the windows. \nAbby is clearly apprehensive--about Ray, not about anything outside. \nABBY ...So? \nRAY I think someone's watching. \nAbby doesn't understand, and has had enough. As she throws the light back on: \nABBY So what'll they see? \nRay turns angrily from the window. \nRAY Just leave it off. He can see in. \nEXT. FACING ROOF \nRay and Abby are once again clearly visible. Ray is starting across the room. \nINT. ABBY'S APARTMENT \nAbby takes a fearful step back as Ray strides toward the light switch, next to her. \nABBY (abruptly) --If you do anything the neighbors'll hear. \nThis brings Ray up short. He stares at Abby. It registers that it is him she's afraid of. \nRAY You think... \nHe shakes his head. \nRAY ...Abby. I meant it... when I called... \nAbby takes another step back. Her voice comes out, after a pause, half-strangled: \nABBY ...I love you too. \nRay winces. He slowly shakes his head with a pained half- smile. \nRAY Because you're scared. \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND \nWaving aimlessly through the ambient dust. He is blindly groping for the sill--and the knife that pins his other hand. \nHis outstretched middle finger just grazes the handle of the knife. \nABBY'S HALLWAY / APARTMENT \nPulling Abby as she draws even with the door of her apartment. \nABBY'S POV \nHer pearl-handled revolver sits on the shelf just inside the door, where Ray left it. It catches the light from the hall. \nADJACENT APARTMENT \nEXTREME CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FINGERTIPS \nThe side of his middle finger rubs against the knife handle; the tip of his index finger barely touches it. Visser's fingers are trembling, indicating that his arm is stretched to its uttermost. \nA surge against the wall gives his fingers another inch or so and they curl around the handle of the knife. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nAs she steps in from the hallway to pick up the gun. She looks around the apartment. \nABBY'S POV \nThe window of the apartment, its glass now completely gone, lets in streetlight. Ray's corpse is a dark form in the middle of the floor. A bright shaft of light slices across the room from offscreen. It glints on the shards of glass that litter the floor, just as in Abby's dream. \nBATHROOM \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER \nAs he slowly, quietly draws his hand in from the hole in the wall. He is holding the knife. \nHe turns slowly to face the door, listening. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nShe steadies herself against the wall and turns to look toward the bathroom. \nABBY'S POV \nThe bathroom door stands slightly ajar. The interior of the bathroom is a bright band in the shadowy recesses of the back of the apartment. \nBATHROOM \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER \nMoving quietly toward the door. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStaring, almost transfixed, at the bathroom door. She raises the gun, trembling, and trains it on the band of light. \nABBY'S POV \nVisser's shadow falls across the crack in the doorway. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe shifts the gun slightly and fires. \nABBY'S POV \nWith the roar of the gun, a small circle of light opens in the door. As the door waffles under the impact, we hear Visser collapsing behind it. \nBACK TO ABBY \nLeaning against the facing wall. She lowers the gun. She slides down the wall to finally rest seated on the floor. She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye. \nHER POV \nThe cracked bathroom door spilling light. \nBACK TO ABBY \nA pause. After a moment, her voice comes out half-choked: \n", "test1_input": "MARTY'S VOICE (barking) Listen asshole, you know who this is. I just got back from Corpus and there's a lot of money missing from the safe... \nThe mail stops dropping; Marty has Meurice's attention. \nMARTY'S VOICE ...I'm not saying you took it but the place was your responsibility and I told you to keep an eye on your asshole friend. Don't--uh, don't come to the bar tonight, I've got a meeting. But tomorrow I want to have a word with you, and with Ray--if you can find him. \nDial tone. Beep. \nMeurice's hand drops into frame. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Meurice, where the hell have you been? I-- \nHis finger presses the stop button. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nRAY'S FINGER \nPressing into a dark stain in the upholstery of the back seat of his car. When he raises it the fingertip is red--the seat still wet with blood. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY \nLooking down at the seat. He backs out of the car and walks up the driveway to his house. \nINT. RAY'S LIVING ROOM \nAs he comes through the screen door. It bangs shut behind him. As he crosses the living room we see, and he hears, Meurice's Trans Am pulling up and stopping at the foot of the lawn. Ray turns and looks out the window. \nCLOSE SHOT  CLOSET DOOR \nRay throws it open and hurriedly pulls out the first thing at hand--a sheet. We hear the door of the Trans Am open and slam shut. \nEXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW \nTRACKING SHOT  ON RAY \nExiting the house as the screen door bangs and shudders behind him. He hurries down the walk. \nTRACKING SHOT  RAY'S POV \nMeurice is rounding the bottom of the lawn and starting up the drive toward the incriminating car. Its back door is standing ajar. \nMEURICE I hope you're planning on leaving town. \nBACK TO RAY \nReacting to the line as he reaches the car. He bends over to throw the sheet over the seat just as Meurice walks up behind him. \nRAY (his back to Meurice; arranging the sheet) Got a problem, Meurice? \nMEURICE No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar? \nRay is still hunched in the open doorway. He freezes momentarily in arranging the sheet. \nRAY ...Why? \nMEURICE You shouldn't have taken the money... \nRay doesn't reply or turn around. Meurice is getting more strident. \nMEURICE ...Look at me man, I'm serious. You broke in the bar and ripped off the safe... \nRay backs out of the car and turns around. \nMEURICE ...Abby warned me you were gonna make trouble. Trouble with you is, you're too fucking obvious; the only ones with the combination are me and you... \nRay looks evenly at Meurice. Behind him the sheet has been arranged over the seat. He puts an unlit cigarette in his mouth. \nMEURICE ...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility. \nRAY (tonelessly) What's that? \nMeurice reaches out and swipes the unlit cigarette out of Ray's mouth. \nMEURICE Those things are nothing but coffin nails. \nHe turns and stares down the street, exasperated. \nMEURICE ...Look. Personally I don't give a shit. I know Marty's a hard-on but you gotta do something. I don't know; give the money back, say you're sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or something... \nMow that his temper is gone, he realizes he has nothing much to say. He shakes his head and turns back down the drive, muttering as he lights himself Ray's cigarette. \nMEURICE ...It's very humiliating, preaching about this shit. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY \n", "test1_true": "MEURICE I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, so you know it's no fucking joke. \nWe hear his car door slam. After a moment Ray exits frame, heading for the house. The camera tracks slowly in to the back window of the car. \nTraces of blood are starting to seep up from the upholstery into the sheet. \nINT. MARTY'S HOUSE  DAY \nLOW WIDE SHOT  FRONT FOYER \nWe are looking across the tiled floor toward the front doorway. The room has the dim gray cast of daytime inside a shuttered house. We hold on the empty foyer as we hear an intermittent high whining sound. We hear the padding of feet on carpet, and then the clatter of nails on tile as Opal, Marty's German shepherd, trots into frame and circles the foyer, still whining. She jumps up and scratches desperately at the front door. \nA slow, rhythmic pounding is very faint on the track. \nEXT. MARTY'S BAR  DUSK \nAbby has just gotten out of her car and is walking up to the front of the darkened bar. The faint, rhythmic thumping continues over the cut, its source somewhere offscreen. As Abby takes a key out of her purse and lets herself into the bar, the thumping stops. \nINT. MARTY'S BAR \nAbby switches on the lights, looks around, goes to the back- office door. Locked. As she fits her key into the lock: \nABBY (quietly) Marty? \nThe door swings open, fanning a shaft of light onto the darkened room. \nMARTY'S OFFICE BATHROOM \nWe are looking from the inside at the bathroom door that won't close all the way. As the light fans into the office beyond and seeps in through the crack of the bathroom door, we see Visser's sleeve cuff and his hand pressing against the door, to hold it near-shut. \nBACK TO ABBY \nStanding in the office doorway. We pull her into the room. She stops abruptly, looking past the camera, and wrinkles her nose. \nABBY'S POV \nMarty's fish, now half-decayed, still lie on the desk. \nSome of the desk drawers stand open, with some of their contents strewn across the surface of the desk. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe takes a step forward. We hear the crunch of glass underfoot. She looks down at the floor. \nABBY'S POV \nShards of broken glass lie on the floor. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe looks up from the floor toward the back door. \nABBY'S POV \nThe pane of the back-door window closest to the knob has been shattered from the outside, scattering broken glass into the office. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe crosses slowly to the desk, staring at the rotted fish. She looks up from the desk. \nABBY'S POV \nOn the standing safe behind the desk lies a white towel. Abby's hand enters frame ans picks up the towel. \nIn slow motion a hammer that's been wrapped inside slips out of the towel, falls end-over-end, hits the floor with a dull thud. \nBACK TO ABBY \nStooping down to pick up the hammer. At eye level as she stoops down is the combination dial to the safe. The dial has been battered by the hammer. Abby looks from the hammer to the floor under the desk chair. \nABBY'S POV \nBlood stains. \nABBY \nStaring down at the floor. She rises and looks at the desk. As she rises we hear glass under her feet. \nABBY'S POV \nThe dead fish. Beyond them, on the floor around the desk, broken glass. \nBACK TO ABBY \n", "test1_id": 1530, "test2_input": "He looks up in his rearview mirror. \nRAY'S POV \nThe headlights of the other car remain motionless behind him. The car makes no move to pass. \nBACK TO RAY \nHe slowly takes the cigarette from his mouth and drops it onto the seat next to him. His eyes shift from the rearview mirror to the traffic light. \nRAY'S POV \nGreen fog floats past the green light. \nBACK TO RAY \nHis face frozen. He turns slowly to look behind. \nRAY'S POV \nThe other car is still motionless. We hear the muted rumble of its engine. \nBACK TO RAY \nHis eyes shift back to the mirror. He gropes for his window handle and slowly rolls it down. He sticks out his left arm, eyes still on the rearview mirror, and waves for the other car to go around him. \nRAY'S POV \nThe other car remains still for a moment. White fog floats up beyond the red fog created by Ray's brake lights. \nFinally the car pulls out slowly to the left to pass. \nBACK TO RAY \nWatching the car pass. \nRAY'S POV \nAs the car pulls out into the light from the intersection and Ray's headlights, we see that it is a battered green Volkswagon. First the car itself, and then its red tail lights, disappear into the fog. \nBACK TO RAY \nWatching, for a long moment. \nFinally he takes his foot off the brake, turns the steering wheel hard left and hangs a U-turn. \nMARTY'S LIVING ROOM  WIDE \nA light is switched on in the expensively appointed room. Meurice enters, walking silently on the carpet, looking around the room. He throws the light off at the far end and leaves. \nMARTY'S BEDROOM  WIDE \nThe door swings open.  Meurice throws the switch near the door and the room is bathed in light. We are once again in the bedroom where we earlier saw Abby looking through her purses. \nWe start to hear the faint buzzing of a fly. \nMeurice glances around, throws off the light, and shuts the door. Black. \nMARTY'S OFFICE \nSomewhere offscreen a light is switched on and we are looking in close shot at the dead fish. \nThe sound of the fly is louder with the cut. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY \nStanding in the doorway from the bar, staring down at the fish. \nWIDE SHOT  THE OFFICE \nRay glances around at the broken glass lying on the floor. His gaze shifts to the safe and the hammer in front of it. He walks over to the safe and stoops down. \nCLOSE SHOT  RAY AT SAFE \nHe works its battered dial and it swings open. He shuffles through the contents and brings out a small pile of photographs. \nRAY'S POV \nAs he flips through the photographs. The first four are Ray and Abby in the motel room bed. The last is a mounted 8 x 10: Abby and Marty on a Gulf beach. \nBACK TO RAY \nLooking. \nHIS POV  PICTURE DETAIL \n", "test2_true": "BACK TO RAY \nHe scowls at the shots Visser took, then puts them back in the safe. When his hand comes out he is holding another photograph--this one folded twice. He unfolds it. \nRAY'S POV \nHis and Abby's corpses. \nBACK TO RAY  FROM ACROSS THE DESK \nAs he straightens slowly from the safe in the background. \nAt desk level, we again see the glint of Visser's lighter under the dead fish. \nRay crosses slowly around the desk into the foreground and lays the picture flat on the desktop.

Even the fucking dog's gone crazy... \n", "test2_id": 1531, "test3_input": "We can hear footsteps approaching up the hallway. \nAbby enters frame and kneels down next to Ray. She fumbles around him briefly in the darkness. \nThe doorknob rattles. Abby freezes, listening, trying to control her breath. After a moment we hear a scraping at the lock. \nAbby moves to the bathroom adjoining the main room and shuts the door behind her. \nBATHROOM \nIt is very small. Abby presses her palms against the door and slowly eases her ear against the door to listen. The scraping in the apartment door lock continues. Sweat streams down Abby's face. She brushes a drop from her eye. \nWe hear the snap of the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges. \nCLOSER ON ABBY \nHer ear pressed to the door. From the next room we hear the sound of footsteps crunching across broken glass. \nAbby backs away from the door, stares at it, then turns and moves to the bathroom window. She looks out. \nABBY'S POV \nA sheer drop to the narrow backyard of the building four stories below. Next to Abby's window is another window, separated from hers only by the breadth of the wall, that separates the two apartments. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nVisser hunches, hands on knees, over Ray, who lies on the floor out of frame. \nVISSER (grimly) All right... \nHe hunkers down closer to Ray. \nVISSER ...You got some of my personal property. \nHe is rummaging through Ray's pockets but comes up empty- handed. \nVISSER ...One of you does. \nVisser looks down at Ray, glances around the room, looks back down at Ray. \nVISSER ...I don't know what the hell you two thought you were gonna pull. \nHis hand, gripping something, flashes down out of frame. We hear a dull crunch. \nBATHROOM \nAbby has drawn her head back from the bathroom window. She moves back to the door and braces herself against it. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nVisser straightens up from Ray's body. He drops something to the floor, out of frame, that lands with a thud. \nHe goes over to the light switch on the wall and flips it back and forth. No light. \nHe goes over to the brass lamp, sets it upright, tries its switch. Again nothing. \nHe disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open doorway. After a moment we hear a refrigerator hum as a cold blue light plays in the doorway. There is the rattle of a can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of its pull-tab being opened. After a couple of audible slurps we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close. \nVisser reappears in the doorway. He surveys the room, fixes on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob. The door swings open. \nHe walks in. \nBATHROOM \nVisser looks around the cramped space. The shower curtain is drawn. He casually draws it back. The shower is empty. \nHe goes to the window and leans out. \nVISSER'S POV \nThe sheer drop below; the other window to one side. \nBACK TO VISSER \nHe draws his head back in, presses his palms against the adjacent wall, and eases his ear to the wall to listen. \nPerfect quiet. \nAfter a moment he goes back to the window, braces himself against the sash, and sticks his arm out--groping for the window of the adjacent apartment. \nEXT. ABBY'S BUILDING / BATHROOM WINDOW \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FACE \nPressing against the glass as he leans against the upper half of the bathroom window. \n", "test3_true": "It finds the adjacent window and starts to raise it. \nBACK TO VISSER'S FACE \nAgain we see him through the window. His jaw is set as he gropes offscreen. \nSuddenly his body jerks violently forward, his head smacking against the glass and cracking it. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. ADJACENT APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND \nAbby (out of frame) has grabbed it and now THUMP she slams the window down on his wrist, catching it between the window sash and sill. \nHer other hand flashes across frame to THUNK pin Visser's hand to the sill with Ray's knife. \nQUICK CUT: \nBACK TO VISSER \nWe hear the shatter of glass as the shock causes his head to break through the window. His hand is nailed into the apartment next door. He is in pain. \nADJACENT APARTMENT \nAbby back slowly from the window, staring at the hand. From the ground below we hear the faint and echoing sounds of the shards of glass shattering against pavement. \nABBY'S POV  THE WINDOW \nVisser's pinned hand is writhing. \nAs we hear a muffled CRACK, a circle of light opens with a puff of plaster dust in the wall that separates the two apartments. A line of light shoots across the dark apartment from the bright bathroom next door. \nBACK TO ABBY \nStaring at the wall. We hear a second CRACK. \nABBY'S POV \nA second hole has opened in the wall, letting through a second shaft of light. \nFour more sharp reports in rapid succession: With each gun blast a bright circle opens and a new shaft of light penetrates the dark apartment. \nFinally we hear the CLICK of an empty chamber, and the clatter of the empty gun being dropped to the floor of the bathroom next door. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStaring at the lines of light that crisscross the apartment. \nThere is a long moment of silence, then a sudden THUMP. \nABBY'S POV  THE WALL \nSix circles of light. \nThe circles go black momentarily as there is another THUMP. And another. Each time Visser pounds his fist against the wall, there is a muffled THUMP and his swinging arm strobes the bullet holes. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe turns and hobbles toward the door of apartment. The muffled thumping continues, as in her dream. \nHALLWAY \nAs Abby emerges from the adjacent apartment. She stops and looks down the hall. \nABBY'S POV \nThe stairway is at the far end of the hall. The door of her own darkened apartment stands slightly ajar. \nADJACENT APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  THE WALL \nThe bullet holes strobing. The pounding, more purposeful now, grows louder and more intense. \nFinally, with a crash, Visser's fist penetrates the wall in an explosion of light and dust. \nHALLWAY \nWe pull Abby as she limps hesitantly down the hall. \nADJACENT APARTMENT \n", "test3_id": 1532}

{"test1_input": "RAY Yeah. \nABBY What was that? \nRAY Your husband. \nBAR BACK OFFICE  NIGHT \nWe are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has just been slapped down on the desktop. \nThe picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the motel room. \nVOICE I know a place you can get that framed. \nThe voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie. \nWe cut to him. \nHe is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. He is LOREN VISSER, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow leisure suit. \nHe smiles at the man behind the desk. \nJULIAN MARTY \nSits staring down at the photograph. Behind him a window opens on the bar proper. Country-western music filters in from the bar. \nMarty is not pleased. \nMARTY What did you take these for? \nVISSER What do you mean... \nHe removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette. \nVISSER ...Just doin' my job. \nMARTY You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for? \nVISSER Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit. \nMARTY How long did you watch her? \nVISSER Most of the night... \nHe lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop. \nIt is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out \"Loren\" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is \"Elks Man of the Year.\" \nVISSER ...They'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again. Quite something. \nMarty stares down at the photograph. \nMARTY You know in Greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news. \nA smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen. \nVISSER Now that don't make much sense. \nMARTY No. It just made them feel better. \nMarty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk. \nVisser laughs as he watches Marty. \nVISSER Well first off, Julian, I don't know what the story is in Greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that... \nMarty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope. \nVISSER ...Second place I ain't a messenger, I'm a private investigator. And third place--and most important--it ain't such bad news. I mean you thought he was a colored. (he laughs) ...You're always assumin' the worst... \nVisser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at Marty. \nVISSER ...Anything else? \nMARTY Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over. \nMarty scales the pay envelope across the desk. It hits Visser in the chest and bounces to the floor. \nVisser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat. Then he roars with laughter. \nVISSER That's good... \"which rock to turn over\"... that's very good... \nSighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. He rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot. \nVISSER Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head... \n", "test1_true": "VISSER ...I can crawl around without it. \nThe door slams shut behind him. \nMarty scowls at the back door. After a moment he rises and crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar. \nOver Marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the window in perpendicular. The camera is tracking forward, past Marty, to frame on the window. \nA black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, over onto the customer side. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nMARTY'S BAR \nREVERSE ANGLE  VAULTING MAN \nTracking back with him as he lands on the customer side and heads across the bar. This shot, from the other side of the back-office window, reveals the window to be one-way glass mirrored on this side \nMEURICE, the black bartender, is muscular, about 200 pounds, dressed in white pants and a sleeveless T-shirt. He is making his way through the crowd towards the jukebox. \nAnother man stands in front of it examining the selections. \nHe deposits a quarter. \nMEURICE Hold it, hold it. What's tonight? \nMAN What? \nMEURICE What night is it? \nMAN (studying Meurice) ...Friday? \nMEURICE Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from? \nMAN Lubbock? \nMeurice shakes his head and punches the selector buttons on the jukebox. \nMEURICE Right. I'm from Detroit (turning to leave) It's a big city up north with tall buildings. \nA Motown song drops. We track behind Meurice as he makes his way back toward the bar. When he reaches it, he claps a couple of people on the shoulder, who make way for him. He vaults back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping a brandy. \nMEURICE Where was I? \nWOMAN You we telling me about the Ring of Fire. \nMEURICE Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but-- \nMARTY Meurice. \nMarty is approaching from the direction of the office. \nMEURICE Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short. \nMARTY Has Ray come in yet? \nMEURICE No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night? \nMARTY (glaring) How would I know? \nMEURICE I don't know, didn't he call? \nMarty loses his glare and his gaze drifts over to the woman. After an awkward pause, Meurice clears his throat. \nMEURICE ...Marty, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Debra. Debra, this is Julian Marty, the dude I'm always talking about. \nShe is unselfconsciously returning Marty's stare. \nMARTY If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra? \nDEBRA Remy. \nMARTY You've got a very sophisticated palate. \nDEBRA Thanks. \nMARTY Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual. \nMeurice walks down the bar. \nDEBRA ...What's a palate? \nMarty studies her for a beat, she studies him, he smiles. \n", "test1_id": 1530, "test2_input": "LANDLADY (cheerful again) I show you around. \nWe follow Abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the short hallway-entrance foyer. Abby glances back at the old man. \nABBY Are you sure this is... Are you sure this apartment is vacant?... Mrs. Esteves? \nThe Landlady laughs cheerfully. \nLANDLADY Oh yes... \nShe gestures to a kitchen alcove on the left. \nLANDLADY ...That's the kitchen... \nShe turns and throws a few more barbs in Spanish back toward the old man, then opens a door on the right side of the foyer and enters the bathroom. \nLANDLADY ...This is the bathroom... \nShe flushes the toilet. \nLANDLADY ...The toilet works and everytheen... \nShe bustles out of the bathroom and takes the two short steps back into the main room. She gestures expansively. \nLANDLADY ...And here we are back in the liveen room. \nShe gives one vigorous stomp. \nLANDLADY ...Good floors. Gas heat. \nShe points. \nLANDLADY ...That's Mr. Garcia. \nThe old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking a cigarette, looking for a place to put the ash. The Landlady snaps at him again in Spanish, and is again cheerful as she turns back to address Abby. \nLANDLADY ...I was just esplaineen to him that he moved out of here yesterday... \nShe walks to the apartment door. \nLANDLADY ...You look around. Don't mind Mr. Garcia; he use do be my brother-in- law. \nShe walks out and shuts the door. \nThe room is quiet. \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStaring at the door. She looks at Mr. Garcia, looks nervously around the apartment. She looks back at Mr. Garcia. \nCLOSE SHOT  MR. GARCIA \nStaring vacantly at Abby. He blows a stream of smoke across the room. The ash falls off his cigarette. \nSTRIP BAR  NIGHT \nEXHORTER'S CUBICLE \nHunched over the public address microphone in his small cubicle of exhortation, is the middle-aged strip-bar barker. Years of service in the bar have left his exhortations depressingly bereft of conviction. \nEXHORTER How 'bout it, gentlemen, let's show out appreciation for Lorraine up there, a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas, how 'bout it gentlemen, yeah... \nTHE BAR PROPER \nMeurice is one of a line of men sitting at the bar, all looking intently at the same point off left. All of the men except Meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently well-to-do. An audio loop is blaring a bump-and-grind version of \"Yellow Rose of Texas,\" punctuated by the crash of cymbals and the thumping of toms. \nAbby enters and sits into an empty chair next to Meurice. \nABBY Looks like the state legislature is out of session. \nMeurice continues to stare intently off. \nMEURICE I thought this is where they met. \nAll of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including Meurice's. A couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks off the bar. \nIn the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of the bar into frame. We crop her just above her white high- heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves. \nThe conversation continues with Abby looking at Meurice, but Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point somewhere above the stripper's calves. \nABBY Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem. \nMEURICE I am? \nThe stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in the foreground. The audience cheers. \n", "test2_true": "MEURICE It won't? \nTwo sheriff-star pasties drop onto the bar. The audience cheers. \nMEURICE ...Ever occur to you, Abby, that maybe I'm the wrong person to ask? \nTHE EXHORTER \nInto his microphone. \nEXHORTER Let's not sit on our wallets, gentlemen. Lorraine is up there dancing her heart out, and if you let that cash money set on your hip, you might just as well be broke... \nABBY AND MEURICE \nShe is rising to leave; he is still staring off. \nABBY Thanks, Meurice. \nMEURICE Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday. \nAn old-west gunbelt hits the bar. The audience roars. \nTHE EXHORTER \nInto his microphone. \nEXHORTER And remember, gentlemen, we're always here, two to two, A.M. to P.M., three hundred and sixty-four days and Christmas, God willing and the creek don't rise... \nRAY'S BEDROOM \nThe room is dark. We are looking across the room toward a moonlit window. Beyond, across the lawn, the lamplit street is empty. \nSuddenly Abby sits bolt upright into frame from the bed below. \nABBY He's in the house. \nOffscreen we hear Ray stirring in bed. \nRAY What's the matter? \nAbby twists around to look down at him. \nABBY I could've sworn I heard something. \nRAY Door's locked. Nothing there. \nHe pulls her down out of frame and we hold on the window and the empty lamplit street. Then Abby rises back into frame, in silhouette against the window, looking down at Ray. \nABBY I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal. \nRAY ...Huh? \nABBY Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me... \nShe taps herself on the forehead. \nABBY ...\"In here, Abby. In here... I'm anal.\" \nHIGH ANGLE  RAY \nLooking up at Abby. \nRAY (yawning) ...Well I'll be damned. \nABBY I couldn't believe it either... \nSIDE ANGLE  ABBY \nFramed against the window, looking down at Ray. \nABBY ...Me on the other hand, I got lots of personality... \nShe drops down onto the bed out of frame. The camera holds on the window through which we see the empty lamplit street. \nABBY Marty always said I had too much. 'Course he was never big on personality... \nShe rises back up into frame, in silhouette against the window. \nABBY ...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some. \nRAY Yeah? What happened? \nABBY Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him. \n", "test2_id": 1531, "test3_input": "CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND \nWaving aimlessly through the ambient dust. He is blindly groping for the sill--and the knife that pins his other hand. \nHis outstretched middle finger just grazes the handle of the knife. \nABBY'S HALLWAY / APARTMENT \nPulling Abby as she draws even with the door of her apartment. \nABBY'S POV \nHer pearl-handled revolver sits on the shelf just inside the door, where Ray left it. It catches the light from the hall. \nADJACENT APARTMENT \nEXTREME CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FINGERTIPS \nThe side of his middle finger rubs against the knife handle; the tip of his index finger barely touches it. Visser's fingers are trembling, indicating that his arm is stretched to its uttermost. \nA surge against the wall gives his fingers another inch or so and they curl around the handle of the knife. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nAs she steps in from the hallway to pick up the gun. She looks around the apartment. \nABBY'S POV \nThe window of the apartment, its glass now completely gone, lets in streetlight. Ray's corpse is a dark form in the middle of the floor. A bright shaft of light slices across the room from offscreen. It glints on the shards of glass that litter the floor, just as in Abby's dream. \nBATHROOM \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER \nAs he slowly, quietly draws his hand in from the hole in the wall. He is holding the knife. \nHe turns slowly to face the door, listening. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nShe steadies herself against the wall and turns to look toward the bathroom. \nABBY'S POV \nThe bathroom door stands slightly ajar. The interior of the bathroom is a bright band in the shadowy recesses of the back of the apartment. \nBATHROOM \nCLOSE SHOT  VISSER \nMoving quietly toward the door. \nABBY'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE SHOT  ABBY \nStaring, almost transfixed, at the bathroom door. She raises the gun, trembling, and trains it on the band of light. \nABBY'S POV \nVisser's shadow falls across the crack in the doorway. \nBACK TO ABBY \nShe shifts the gun slightly and fires. \nABBY'S POV \nWith the roar of the gun, a small circle of light opens in the door. As the door waffles under the impact, we hear Visser collapsing behind it. \nBACK TO ABBY \nLeaning against the facing wall. She lowers the gun. She slides down the wall to finally rest seated on the floor. She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye. \nHER POV \nThe cracked bathroom door spilling light. \nBACK TO ABBY \nA pause. After a moment, her voice comes out half-choked: \n", "test3_true": "HER POV \nThe bathroom door. Quiet for a long moment. \nThen, from inside the bathroom, we hear laughter. \nBACK TO ABBY \nStaring at the door. We hear the laughter subside, to leave the sound of labored breathing. Finally: \nVISSER (O.S.) ...Well ma'am... \nBATHROOM \nVisser lies on his back, his head underneath the bathroom sink. \nHis good hand is pressed against his belly, which rises and falls with his heavy breathing. Blood seeps out between his fingers. \nHe is smiling. \nVISSER ...If I see him, I'll sure give him the message. \nHIS POV \nThe underside of the sink, its convoluted chrome works beading moisture. \nVISSER \nLooking, with mild interest. \nHIS POV \nA condensed droplet trickles down the chrome. \nDirectly overhead, it hangs for a moment from the lowest joint of the pipe. \nIt fattens, wavers, wavers--and falls, spelling... \nFINIS. \n[DELETED SCENE FROM 1st.

KYLE, a heavyset man of thirty wearing a feed cap, sits in the lobby's one piece of furniture, a beat-up leatherette sofa. He sips from a can of soda. \nRay, begrimed and haggard, enters out of the glare of the noonday sun. \nRHODES Hey there, stranger! What can I do you for? \nRAY I need a room. \nCalling out from the divan: \nKYLE He needs a room, Dusty. \nRHODES I reckon I can hear him...

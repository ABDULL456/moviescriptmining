Sitting in front of the closed side is a uniformed officer, greeting, ad lib, the various employees as they enter. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n4. INT.

CLOSE SHOT AT SWITCHBOARD \nA telephone operator, busily plugging in wires. \nOPERATOR \n(mechanically sweet voice) \nGood morning . . . Union National Bank . . . Just a minute\u0097 \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n6. INT. ENTRANCE ROOM TO VAULTS - MED. SHOT \nOf the inside of a massive vault door, made impressive by the shining, finely cut steel bolts and the many other intricate-looking instruments which adorn it. \nCAMERA PANS UP to a clock overhead which registers 9:03. \nA group of young men, paying tellers, are impatiently watching a teller struggle with the lock that will admit them to the vault. \nTELLER \nCome on, come on, Oscar, what are we waiting for? \n2ND TELLER \nWhat's the matter? Can't you find it? \n3RD TELLER \nSneak up on it, boy! \n4TH TELLER \nOscar, come on! \nCHARLIE \nSay, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it! \nThey all laugh, as Oscar finds the combination. \nOSCAR \nAlmonds to you![1] Almonds! \nTELLERS \nNow, now, Oscar - not almonds! \nThe CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they pass through the first portal. \nCHARLIE \nNine o'clock and all is lousy! \n1ST TELLER \nYes, I spend half of my life waiting for these time clocks to open. Say, where's Matt? \nCHARLIE \nProbably upstairs thinking up that daily joke. \n2ND TELLER \nThat guy kills me with his wisecracks. \n3RD TELLER \nSay, when he comes in, let's put on a frozen face. Let's not smile. \nThey ad-lib agreement. \n1ST TELLER \nShhh! Nix! Here he comes\u0097 \n7. MED. SHOT \nCAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief teller, as he strides briskly in and begins turning the combination dial to the main vault. He is about twenty-six, a clean-looking, personable youngster. Several of the tellers are standing close to him, looking on. \nMATT \nHow are you doing slaves? \nTELLERS \nHello, Matt. How're you Matt? \nMatt begins to work the combination of the main lock. \nMATT \n(with his back to them) \nSay, did you boys ever hear the story of the pawnbroker with the glass eye? \n1ST TELLER \nNo Matt, what is the story about the pawnbroker with the glass eye? \nMATT \n(as he continues to fiddle with the lock) \nWell, I'll tell you. A fellow went into this shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker said, \"I'll give you $50 for it, if you can tell me which is my glass eye.\" The fellow said, \"All right, I'll do that. It's the right one.\" The pawnbroker said, \"That's correct. But how did you know it was the right one?\" The fellow \nsaid, \"well, it's got more sympathy than the other one.\" \nHe turns, expecting their laugh, but is confronted by stone faces. \nMATT \nSympathy! You know, the right one had more sympathy than the other one! \n1ST TELLER \nWhat's the matter? Can't you get this thing open? \nMatt stares in disbelief, then gets the joke. \nMATT \n(contemptuously) \nSix reasons why banks fail! \nThis cracks them all up, as a uniformed officer, who has been standing by, works a lever attached to the floor, which lowers a section of the floor, directly in front of the vault. This permits the vault door, which is sunk below the floor level, to swing open. \nTELLERS \n(ad-libbing) \nI love your jokes, Matt! They're so entertaining! A very funny man! \n8. MED. SHOT \nMatt opens the inside door, made up of perpendicular steel bars. The tellers scurry into the cavernous-looking interior. Someone snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS UP TO VAULT. \nAnother teller is busy in the cage next to him. Matt addresses him, referring to Charlie. \nMATT \nThat mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar. \nTELLER \nYeah, what did he do with his first one? \nMATT \nBought himself a pocketbook! \nThe teller laughs heartily. \n15. MED. SHOT \nTHE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she crosses the main floor of the bank, reaches Matt's teller window and pushes it open. \nMATT \nHello, Helen! \nHELEN \n(conspiratorially) \nMatt, come here! \nMATT \nWhy? \nHELEN \nCome here, honey! \nHe leans over, and she gives him a quick kiss. \nMATT \nHey, look out, somebody's likely to see us! \nHELEN \n(already walking away) \nOh, is that so? \nShe quickly kisses him again, crosses back, and takes the grand stairs up to the outer office of the bank president as Matt watches with a grin. \n16. INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT \nJust then, a group of five or six important-looking men enter scene on the way to the conference room. One of the men looks towards Helen's desk. \n17. MED. SHOT \nOn Helen and a secretary standing next to her. \nSECRETARY \n(to Helen) \nOh, oh. Look who's here. \n18. MED. SHOT \nThe other clerks and tellers, noticing the newcomers as they file past. \nTELLER \nHey, psst! \nOSCAR \nOh, oh. Five ill winds. \nTELLER \n(standing next to Oscar) \nAnd blowing no good for the old man, either. \n19. CLOSER SHOT ON HELEN'S DESK \nShooting toward Helen. \nHELEN \n(acidly) \nThe four-and-a-half horsemen.[3] \nGIRL \nWhat are they doing here? There's no board meeting today. \nHELEN \nSearch me. \nBy this time, the important group of men have reached Helen, and are passing her by, with perfunctory nods. \nCLARK \n(the most important of the important-looking men; to Helen) \nMr. Dickson in yet? \nHELEN \nNot yet, Mr. Clark. \nCLARK \nWhen he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room. \nHELEN \nYes, sir. \nCLARK \nAnd tell him not to delay. \nHELEN \nYes, sir. \nThe group of men file through the board room door, and out of sight. \nGIRL \n(to Helen) \nLooks like trouble for your boss. \nHELEN \nTakes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss. \nGIRL \n(as she turns to go) \nSez you! \n20. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT \nTaking in all of room. The directors are all here, and some sit around a long, narrow mahogany table. Clark, the sour-faced old \nbird we saw previously talking to Helen, paces back and forth agitatedly. \nCLARK \nI've sent for the cashier, gentlemen. He has a list of the loans that Dickson made last month. \n21. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK \nAs he stops in his pacing a moment and addresses the directors further: \nCLARK \nAnd as I told you at breakfast, it is time we did something about it. \n22. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ \nIn thorough accord with Clark's violent attitude is Schultz, a German, whose instinctive conservatism rebels against Dickson's liberal banking methods. \nJANITOR \nWhy, I don't know. \nDICKSON \nYou see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform. \nThe man exits scene. Bill picks up the conversation where he left off. \nBILL \nTom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest\u0097 \nDICKSON \n(interrupting) \nI'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. \n(softening) \nPersonally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent. \nBILL \nBut listen, Tom, I\u0097 \nThey have now reached the anteroom of Dickson's private chamber, where Helen sits at her desk. \n45. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson comes up to Helen at her desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices her. \nDICKSON \nGood morning, Mrs. Pembroke. \nMRS. PEMBROKE \nGood morning, Mr. Dickson. \nDICKSON \nGot my letter? \nMRS. PEMBROKE \nYes, thank you. \nDICKSON \nHello, Helen. \nHELEN \nGood morning. \nDICKSON \nHelen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it? \nHELEN \nI don't know. \nDICKSON \nGuess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married? \nHELEN \n(awkwardly) \nWhy - well, I\u0097 \nDICKSON \nUmmm. Stalling, eh? \n(changing tone, professionally) \nAnything new? \nHELEN \nWhy, the directors are waiting for you in the board room. \nDICKSON \nDirectors, eh? Long faces? \nHe gestures accordingly. \nHELEN \n(she trumps his gesture) \nLonger. \nDICKSON \n(half-under his breath) \nI haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either. \nMrs. Pembroke has been standing by, waiting to get a word in edgewise. CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY with him to take in the lady: \nMRS. PEMBROKE \nMr. Dickson? \nDICKSON \nAh, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . . \nDuring this speech the phone bell rings. \n46. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Helen picks up the phone and quietly answers it. Bill Saunders is standing nearby, still waiting to talk to Dickson again. \nHELEN \n(into phone) \nHello . . . \n(she turns to Dickson) \nMrs. Dickson on the phone. \nDickson comes over to the desk and as he picks up the receiver, he looks toward Mrs. Pembroke. \nDICKSON \n(to Mrs. Pembroke) \nYou'd better hurry over there. He's waiting for you. \n(then into phone) \nHello, dear . . . \n47. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON \nAs he continues, into phone: \nDICKSON \nWhere are you? . . . Sure, well, come on down right away. Huh? . . . Yes, of course I remember. It's tonight. \n(smiles) \nSee what a social hound I'm becoming! . . . All right, goodbye, dear. \nHe hangs up. Mrs. Pembroke is waiting for him to finish. She has apparently been disappointed in the news he has for her. \nMRS. PEMBROKE \nBut, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty. \nDICKSON \n(ill-at-ease) \nMr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . . \n48. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs they walk toward camera, they glance around the bank with a professional casualness, but obviously very much impressed. Their eyes rove around the place and finally land on some object where they stop. \nCUT TO: \n52. CLOSEUP - CHARLIE \nAs he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills. \nCUT TO: \n53. CLOSE SHOT - THREE RACKETEERS \nTheir eyes glisten. Their mouths water, as they watch Charlie off scene. \nCUT TO: \n54. MEDIUM SHOT \nInside the railing. Cluett emerges from his office and starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly stops in his tracks. \n55. CLOSEUP - CLUETT \nHe stares off at the racketeers. A look of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse is to turn back. \n56. CLOSE GROUP SHOT \nThe three gangsters. A quick flash. Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly at him. \nLEADER \nThere he is! Good morning! \n57. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT \nHe changes his mind about avoiding them. His face breaks into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches the three men, his hand outstretched in forced amiability. \nCLUETT \n(shaking) \nGood morning! Who do you want to see? \nThe gangsters shake hands with him, their expressions remaining unchanged, which adds immeasurably to Cluett's discomfort. \nLEADER \n(flatly) \nYou. \n1ST GANGSTER \n(drawling) \nYeah. We wanna talk to you about a big deal. \nThere is a sinister significance in the manner in which he emphasizes \"a big deal.\" Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease. \nCLUETT \n(uncertainly - sickly smile) \nOh, yes. Well, come right this way. \nHe opens the swinging gate in front of him, permitting the three racketeers to enter. They start for Cluett's office. \n58. INT. ANTE ROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHelen sits at her typewriter near a railing, overlooking the bank below. Another girl stands by her, both are staring off scene. \nCUT TO: \n59. INT. BANK LOBBY - MED. LONG SHOT \nFrom Helen's angle. \nCluett and the three gangsters going into Cluett's office. \n60. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHelen and other secretary. \nHELEN \nHey Pat, come here! Look! \nSECRETARY \n(to Helen) \nThat's Dude Finlay, all right - I've seen his picture in the papers hundreds of times. \nHELEN \nI wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett. \nSECRETARY \n(still staring - thrilled - shuddering) \nGee, I'm scared. He's one of the toughest gangsters in town. \nCUT TO: \n61. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. LONG SHOT \nShooting down the length of the table. The men are all sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet. \nDICKSON \n(firmly) \nGentlemen, you're only wasting your time. There'll be no merger. \n62. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson continues. \nDICKSON \n(the injustice kills him) \nWhy should I turn this bank over to anybody else? I've worked twenty-five years night and day to build it up, and now you're asking me to dump it into somebody's lap\u0097 \n(with finality) \nNothing doing! \nSchultz, who is seated near Dickson, looks up at him: \nSCHULTZ \nYou can make a handsome profit on your stock. \nDICKSON \nI'm not interested in profits. I'm interested in the bank. In the depositors. They're my friends. They're looking to me for protection, and I'm not walking out on them. \nClark and O'Brien, also seated around close to Dickson. \nCLARK \nHow are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans! \nO'BRIEN \n(admonishing him) \nTake it easy, Clark. \nIves, seated next to Schultz, becomes alarmed. \nIVES \n(still trying) \nMy dear friends . . . \nDICKSON \n(unruffled, paying no attention to Ives) \nIt's all right. Let him go ahead. Let him speak his piece. I like it. Go on. \nCLARK \nAll right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson, you've got to change your policy. \n63. CLOSER SHOT \nDUDE \n(threateningly - quietly) \nWe can take blood from anything \u0097 \n(pauses) \nIf it's comin' to us. \n77. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nShooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite side of desk, the other two men still standing by the desk. \nA look of alarm spreads over Cluett's face. There is nothing hidden in this threat. \nCLUETT \n(wants time to think) \nPerhaps if you'll wait a little while, I might be able\u0097 \nONE OF THE MEN \n(snappily) \nWe waited long enough! \nDUDE \n(shrewdly - to the men) \nNix. Lay off. \n(to Cluett) \nNow - what's the use of getting excited, Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to lay your mitts on that kind of dough \n78. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT \nShooting past Dude, as Dude continues, slowly, deliberately: \nDUDE \nThere's plenty of it in this bank - laying around loose. \nCluett looks up - horror-stricken. \nCLUETT \n(pop-eyed, choked voice) \nGood heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I\u0097 \nDUDE \nWhy not? \nCLUETT \n(perspiring freely) \nWhy, I couldn't do that . . . ! \nDUDE \n(flatly) \nYou don't have to do nothing. \nCluett looks up toward the men - then at Dude. \nCLUETT \n(slowly) \nWhat do you mean? \nDUDE \nAll you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see? \nThere is a pause while Cluett stares at them, horrified, his confused mind trying to assimilate the ghastliness of their proposal. Suddenly he starts to rise. \n79. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Cluett gets to his feet and faces Dude across the desk. \nCLUETT \nNo, no, I couldn't - I couldn't do anything like that. I\u0097 \nSmack! The rest of his speech dies in his throat. The man to his right has slapped him across the face with his open palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand goes to his cheek. He stares at them, bewildered and frightened. \nCluett, feeling himself trapped and helpless, slowly sinks into his chair. \nCUT TO: \n80. INT. ANTEROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT \nHelen sits at her typewriter. A very dignified, beautiful woman of thirty approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson, Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement and culture. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(pleasantly) \nGood morning, Helen. \n81. CLOSER SHOT \nAt Helen's desk, as Helen looks up at Mrs. Dickson. \nHELEN \nHow-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson. \nMRS. DICKSON \nIs that busy husband of mine busy? \nHELEN \n(indicating conference room) \nHe's at a board meeting. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(not unexpected) \nBoard meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose. \nHELEN \nI'm afraid so. \nMRS. DICKSON \nHelen, did you ever try competing with a bank? \nHELEN \nNo. \nMRS. DICKSON \nWell, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you? \nHELEN \nHardly. \n82. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON \nShooting past Helen. \nMRS. DICKSON \nOh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me! \nHELEN \nAll right. \n83. MEDIUM SHOT \nHelen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves in the direction of Cluett's office. \nCUT TO: \nMatt crosses to the desk as Dickson is speaking. \n102. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK \nAs Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm. The scene he just witnessed has taken the joy out of everything. \nMATT \nIt's all right. Thanks. \nDICKSON \nAnd what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . \n(the idea pleases him) \nNot a bad thought, eh? \nHe suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm. \n103. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO \nShooting toward Dickson. \nHe leans forward to look at Matt closely: \nDICKSON \nWhat's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it. \nMATT \n(feebly) \nSure, I think it's swell. \nDICKSON \n(scrutinizing him closely, very much hurt) \nSay, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real. \n104. CLOSE SHOT - MATT \nShooting past Dickson. \nMatt makes an attempt to snap out of it - and answers quickly. \nMATT \nAw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all. \n(working up a little enthusiasm) \nSure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough. \n105. MEDIUM SHOT \nDICKSON \nAw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married? \nMATT \nWell, I\u0097 \nDICKSON \nI suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh? \nThey are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Phyllis Dickson. Both men look up as she appears in the door. \n106. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON \nAs she stops in doorway. She glances fearfully, first at Matt and then at her husband, trying to sense whether Matt has said anything. She is quickly assured by Dickson's affable greeting. \n107. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson comes toward her, arms extended: \nDICKSON \nWell, look who's here! Hello, dear. \nMRS. DICKSON \nHello, darling. \nHe kisses her. Then throws his arms around her for an exaggerated \"teddybear\" hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis looks gratefully at Matt. \n108. CLOSE SHOT - MATT \nHe returns her glance. His eyes are unable to disguise his contempt. \n109. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nDickson and Phyllis. He releases her. \nDICKSON \nIf this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man! \nMRS. DICKSON \n(with a half-smile) \nIt's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you. \nDICKSON \nOooh! That has the earmarks! \nHe notices Matt, still standing there, uncomfortably. \nDICKSON \n(good-naturedly) \nAre you still here? Go on - go to work! What do you think I pay you for? \nMatt exits. \nCUT TO: \n110. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Matt comes out and moves quickly forward as if anxious to get away from the embarrassing situation he found himself in. Helen, upon seeing him, jumps up. \nHELEN \n(excitedly) \nWhat happened? What did he say? Did you get the job? \nMATT \n(dolefully) \nYeah. \n111. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nShe is perplexed by his unenthusiastic attitude. \nHELEN \nWhat's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death. \nMATT \nCome here. \n(he takes her aside) \nYou know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there. \nHELEN \nWell . . . ? \nMATT \nWell, he was making love to her. \nHelen, although she had a vague suspicion, is shocked. \nHELEN \n(after a pause) \nYes. \nCLUETT \nHave you the correct time? \nDRIVER'S VOICE \nCLUETT \n12:05. Fine. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(looking out) \nWhat's this? \nCLUETT \nMy apartment. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(mock-melodramatic) \nI knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home. \nCLUETT \nCome on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(definitely) \nNo. I know the answer to that one. \n(shaking her head) \nI think you'd better take me home. \nCLUETT \nWhat's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? \n130. CLOSER SHOT ON THE TWO \nMRS. DICKSON \nNo. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals\u0097 \n(on second thought) \nI think I will have a drink. \nCLUETT \nGood for you. Come on. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n131. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CLUETT'S APT. - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nCluett and Mrs. Dickson emerge from the elevator and cross to his apartment, CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. Cluett fumbles in his pocket for the key. \nMRS. DICKSON \nYou know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class. \nCLUETT \nOh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife. \nMRS. DICKSON \nWhat is that, Mr. Bones?[7] \nCLUETT \nA misunderstood bachelor. \nCluett smiles. He has the door open by now and stands aside to permit her to enter. \nCUT TO: \n132. INT. CLUETT'S APARTMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAt door. Phyllis Dickson has just stepped in, and Cluett follows. He closes the door and locks it. \nCLUETT \n(mock-melodramatic) \nAnd now fair woman, I have you in my power. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(playing along) \nI'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache! \nCLUETT \nI'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here. \nCAMERA TRUCKS WITH THEM as he chases her into the next room. She alights on a piano bench, and runs her fingers up and down the scales. Suddenly Cluett stops. He stares off, a look of amazement in his face. Mrs. Dickson turns and follows his gaze and she, too, is startled. \nCAMERA PANS QUICKLY over to the other side of the room. Matt sits on the edge of a chair waiting for them. He rises, looks off toward Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. As he starts forward, CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and Phyllis. \nMRS. DICKSON \nWhy, Matt! \nCLUETT \n(when he recovers from his surprise) \nWhat are you doing here? \nMatt enters the scene. \nMATT \nThe butler said I could stay. I told him it was important. \nCLUETT \nOh, yeah? \nCluett steps over to a bell cord and pulls it. \nMATT \nHe's not here. He left at nine o'clock. He said you gave him the night off. \nCluett wheels around, infuriated. \nCLUETT \nWhat do you want? \n133. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO \nFavoring Matt. \nMATT \n(uncomfortably) \nWell, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you. \nCLUETT \n(sharply) \nI'm listening. \nMATT \n(hesitatingly) \nIt's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it. \n(a glance toward Mrs. Dickson) \nYou see, I kind of expected to find you here alone. \nAs Cluett starts away: \n139. INT. OF BANK - NIGHT \nA series of quick vignettes: \nCluett's watch, showing 12:07. \nA wall clock, showing 12:07. \nA night watchman, alerted by suspicious noise, creeping up to the vault. \nThe night watchman, shot by figures in the shadows. \nA small number of men rush out of the vault, clutching money bags and toting guns. \nThe night watchman, getting off a shot, before he crumples to the floor. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \n140. INT. VAULT ROOM OF BANK - CLOSEUP ON DOOR \nThe vault door, partly opened. Over the shot we hear excited murmurs. \nCAMERA STARTS TRUCKING BACK SLOWLY, until it takes in the full room. A fingerprint expert is working on the time clock for finger-print impressions. The medical examiner bends over the body of the watchman, whose face is covered with a cloth. A detective in charge of the proceedings stands around, looking very officious. \nDETECTIVE \nWhat do you say, Doc? \nDOCTOR \nOh, I'd say about eight or nine hours. \nDETECTIVE \nWell, you'd better call the coroner. \nCAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until it passes a group of tellers and clerks in a huddle. They listen breathlessly as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, relates his story. For the moment he is the center of attraction, and he revels in it. \nOSCAR \n(breathlessly) \nI was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda knocked me over with a pin. \nAD-LIB FROM LISTENERS \n(murmuring) \nGee . . . Can you imagine . . . \nOSCAR \nDo you see that clock? Right there. That's where the bullet hit. When I saw that, you coulda knocked me over with a pin. \nCLERK \nWas there much blood? \nOSCAR \nBlood! \n(gesturing toward body) \nCome on over fellas. I'll show you. \nThe clerks head toward the dead body, but are intercepted by the officious detective. \nDETECTIVE \n(officiously) \nGet back there . I don't want anything touched until the Inspector gets here. \nThe clerks, awe-stricken, retreat. \nCHARLIE \n(running up) \nOscar, what's the matter? \nOSCAR \nI was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet. \nCHARLIE \nNo kidding? \nOSCAR \nNo kidding. When I saw it, you coulda knocked me over with a pin. \nCHARLIE \nWhere's Matt? \nOSCAR \nMatt? \nCHARLIE \nYeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . . \nOSCAR \nThe detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office. \nCHARLIE \nHe has? \nOSCAR \nYeah. \nCLERK \nSay, did Matt do it? \nOSCAR \nDon't look at me. I don't know. \nTELLER \nSay, he did look kinda funny yesterday, didn't you notice it? \nOTHERS \nYeah, he did. I noticed it too. \nOSCAR \nYou coulda knocked me over with a pin! \nCUT TO: \n141. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - MATT'S FRIGHTENED FACE \nHe sits in a chair. The side of his face is swollen from Cyril Cluett's punch of the night before. \nINSPECTOR'S VOICE \n(like a tri-hammer) \nCome on, come on. You might as well tell me the truth. What did you do with the money? \nMATT \nI didn't do it. I told you all I know, Inspector. \nCAMERA TRUCKS BACK revealing the other occupants of the room. The Inspector leans over Matt, firing questions at him. Two detectives are also there, one at the door, the other near Matt. Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful, looking on. \nINSPECTOR \nYou turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you? \nMATT \n(rises in indignation) \nI wasn't anywhere near this place\u0097 \nINSPECTOR \nAll right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he? \nINSPECTOR \nIf he can do it, yes. \nDICKSON \nWhy, certainly he can. \n(to Matt) \nMatt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right. \nMATT \n(averting Dickson's gaze) \nI already told him I was home. \nDICKSON \n(to Inspector) \nThere you are. \nINSPECTOR \nThat's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now. \nDICKSON \n(confidently) \nGood. \n(to Matt, smiling) \nYou've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released. \n(to Inspector) \nAnd listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little. \nHe exits scene. \n148. INT. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - FULL SHOT \nShowing the normal activity of the bank in contrast to the turmoil going on inside. Just a few people scattered about. \nCAMERA TRUCKS towards the other end of the lobby, establishing the calm and peace of the place along the way. CAMERA STOPS on a CLOSE SHOT at the bank telephone operator at the switchboard. Oscar, the young teller, is relating his story for the hundredth time. \nOSCAR \nGee, what do you think? There was that watchman, that poor watchman, lying on the floor right in front of me. Oh, you coulda knocked me over with a pin! \nOPERATOR \n(wide-eyed) \nYou don't say! Dead? \nOSCAR \nDead? He was lifeless! You know, I was the first one to see him. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying on the floor, right in front of me. Dead! I tell you, you coulda knocked\u0097 \nOPERATOR \n(interrupting) \nYeah, I coulda knocked you over with a pin. \nOSCAR \nYeah, you coulda\u0097 \n(realizes he is getting the brush-off) \nOh - almonds to you! Almonds! \nOscar exits scene. The operator turns her attention to the switch-board, apparently Oscar has interrupted a conversation she has been having. \nOPERATOR \nHello, Mame. This is Gert, again\u0097 \n(pause) \nSay, listen - I just heard something that'll make your head swim . . . Listen to this . . . Yeah, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over a hundred thousand dollars. \n149. ANOTHER SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR - CLOSE SHOT \nMAME \n(into phone) \nWho did it? \nGERT \nI don't know who did it, but the chief teller's in an awful jam. \nMAME \nCall me up later. I'm going to call up Lou now. \nShe pulls the plug, plugs in another wire. \nMAME \nHello, Lou. Did you hear what happened over at the Union National Bank? \n(a light flashes) \nWait a minute, Lou. \n(plugs in wire) \nHello? Yes, sir. I'm trying to get them. \n(pulls plug) \nYes, Lou, listen. They was robbed over two hundred thousand dollars. Can you beat that? \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n150. EXT. FRONT OF AN OFFICE BLDG. - MED. SHOT \nTwo men coming out of the building, engrossed in conversation. \nMAN \nStole over a quarter of a million. Can you beat that? \nThe other man whistles in surprise. \n2ND MAN \n(whistling) \nWhew! You can't laugh that off. \nSeveral people in the crowd, overhearing them, turn and stare. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n151. EXT. A STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOf an old lady, pitiful expression, begging alms. Two gentlemen are beside her. One of them reaches in his pocket for a coin. \n3RD MAN \nI thought the Union National was pretty solid. \nAt the mention of the Union National, the old lady looks up, startled. \n4TH MAN \nI did too. \n3RD MAN \nHalf a million is a lot of money. I wouldn't be surprised if they had to close their doors. \nThe first man drops a coin in the old lady's palm and they leave. The beggar woman, oblivious of the coin in her hand, stares unbelieving, at the departing men. Suddenly her face screws up in horror. \nOLD LADY \nOh, good gracious! \nTOUGH GUY \n(into phone) \nAll right. I'll get it or bust a few noses! \nANOTHER MAN \n(into phone) \nHoly smoke! I'll get right down there if I have to fly! \nANOTHER WOMAN \n(into phone) \nRun down there and get your money at once! \nAD-LIB VOICES \n(quick cuts - a rising tide - different languages) \nHello, dear . . . Hurry! . . . Union National is sunk! . . . I told you to put it in the vault . . . I don't know what's wrong with the bank . . . I wouldn't trust anybody . . . everybody's taking their money out . . . Union National's broken . . . Why take any chances? . . . Hurry! Call the others! etc. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n158. INT. LOBBY OF THE BANK - FULL SHOT \nShowing in comparison to previous shot, the effect of the rumors. The lobby is buzzing with activity. Lines form in front of all the windows. Depositors crowd around the writing tables. There are not \nenough pens to go around. Frantic hands reach over shoulders for withdrawal blanks. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD. Over the shot is heard the seething blend of many voices. \nCAMERA STOPS ON a Teller and a Man. \nTELLER \nClosing your account? \nMAN \nYes, sir. I'm closing my account. I wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank. \nCAMERA STOPS ON a 2nd Man talking to a Woman. \n2ND MAN \nIt's getting so a man's money ain't safe unless it's in his sock. \nWOMAN \nThey're all a bunch of crooks. \n2nd MAN \nYou said it. \nCAMERA STOPS ON Jewish Man talking to a 4th Man standing next to him. \nJEWISH MAN \nSay, did I know the bank was going to go caflooey? What am I - a fortune teller or something? \nCAMERA STOPS on a MED. CLOSE SHOT of Molly (the Zasu Pitts type). She is reaching over a man's shoulder to capture a withdrawal blank. \nMOLLY \n(fluttering) \nOh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! \nMAN \nWhat's the matter, lady? \nMOLLY \nOh, mister, I gotta! I gotta! \nMAN \nWell, they only sign slips here. \nMOLLY \nGimme your pen, please! \nShe grabs pen away from him. He turns to someone next to him. \nMAN \nWill you loan me that pen of yours? I'm in an awful hurry. \nCAMERA MOVES ON to a CLOSE SHOT of a teller frantically beckoning Sampson. \nTELLER \nI need some more money! All of the depositors are withdrawing. \nSAMPSON \nI know, I know. I'll get you some. \nHe hurriedly exits scene. \nCUT TO: \n159. INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT \nInspector is still holding his ground. Matt sits dejectedly in the same place as before. \nINSPECTOR \n(to Dickson) \nAll I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty. \n160. CLOSER SHOT ON GROUP \nDICKSON \nWhat are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did. \nINSPECTOR \nMaybe. But I'm taking no chances. \n(emphatically) \nWhy, this kid's got a record. \nDICKSON \nSo have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they\u0097 \nHe is interrupted by the sound of the door opening. He looks off toward door. \n161. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nSampson stands there, looking off toward the group. \nSAMPSON \nMr. Dickson! Can I see you for a minute? \nDICKSON'S VOICE \nNo, I'm busy. See me later. \nSAMPSON \nBut this is important, Mr. Dickson. Looks like there's a run on the bank. \n162. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nDickson and the others. Dickson looks off at Sampson, unbelievingly: \nDICKSON \nWhat? A run on the bank! \nCAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he rushes over to the door to Sampson. \nSAMPSON \nThe lobby's half filled now. \nDICKSON \nWhat are you talking about? \nHe feels himself cornered. The Inspector's voice comes over the shot. \nINSPECTOR'S VOICE \nDid you happen to be awake when he came in last night? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nYes, sir. I was having me hot mustard bath. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat time was it? \n172. MED. CLOSEUP - GROUP \nAs Mrs. Halligan continues. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \n\u0097for the rheumatism, you know. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat time was it, Mrs. Halligan? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nIt was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know. \nThe Inspector is getting impatient. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat time was it? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nHuh? \nINSPECTOR \nWhat time did Matt Brown get in? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nNow, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after\u0097 \nINSPECTOR \n(snappily) \nI don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nThat's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . . \nINSPECTOR \nWas it twelve o'clock? \n173. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nDickson, Matt, and the rest of the group. Some show their amusement. Dickson and Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. Halligan's voice comes into scene. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nNo, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley sisters . . . \nINSPECTOR'S VOICE \n(interrupting her quickly) \nWas it one o'clock? \n174. CLOSE SHOT \nInspector and Mrs. Halligan. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nYes, I guess it was one, 'cause . . \nINSPECTOR \n(jumping her) \nIt couldn't have been earlier? \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nNo. It wasn't earlier because . . . \nINSPECTOR \nYes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \n(firmly) \nNo - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one. \nINSPECTOR \n(exasperated) \nThere you are! \n175. MEDIUM SHOT \nMatt speaks: \nMATT \nAw, she doesn't know what she's talking about. \nMrs. Halligan looks at him, offended. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nWho don't know? \nShe comes toward him threateningly. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nListen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it\u0097 \nINSPECTOR \n(coming after her, takes her arm) \nThat's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks. \nInspector leads her to the door. On the way Mrs. Halligan continues to mumble her protest against Matt's insult. \nMRS. HALLIGAN \nFor two nickels I'd knock his block off. I never told a lie in me life. \nShe exits out of room. \n176. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson steps closer to Matt. \nDICKSON \n(heartsick) \nIs that true, Matt? \nInspector comes up to them now. \nINSPECTOR \nOf course it's true - and he knows it. \nDICKSON \n(tenderly) \nListen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night? \nMATT \n(after a pause) \nAD-LIB FROM CROWD \nWe want it now! We don't want no speeches! \n182. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON \nAs he addresses the crowd: \nDICKSON \nListen to me now. It takes time. I've got seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can. If you'll all calm down, I'm making arrangements to keep the doors open until four o'clock this afternoon and you can be paid today. \n183. MEDIUM SHOT OF THE CROWD \nAs they cheer their approval and return to their buddies. \n184. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson starts back toward the offices, Sampson comes to meet him. \nSAMPSON \nWe can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour. \nDICKSON \nDon't you think I know it? \nThey both start walking toward Dickson's office - CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM. As they pass the conference room, Schultz comes out and stops Dickson. \nSCHULTZ \nWe're still waiting for you, Dickson. \nDickson looks up, studies Schultz a moment, as if trying to make up his mind whether to consult the Board of Directors or not. \nCUT TO: \n185. INT. DIRECTORS' ROOM - MED. SHOT \nThe door opens and Dickson enters, followed by Schultz. They all look up. Dickson goes up to them. \nDICKSON \nWell, gentlemen, we've got about one more hour to go. You know what that means? \n186. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nDickson and the Directors. \nDICKSON \n(continuing) \nWe'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help? \nCLARK \n(defiantly) \nWhat do you mean, help? \nDICKSON \nI know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes. \nCLARK \nThat sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes? \nDICKSON \nI have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it? \n187. CLOSE SHOT \nClark and Schultz. \nCLARK \n(this is just what he's been waiting for) \nOh, is it? Since when? Judging from the way you've ignored us, you wouldn't think so. \nSCHULTZ \nWe tried to reason with you, but you wouldn't listen to us. \n188. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nShooting toward Dickson. \nCLARK \nThe depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them? \nDICKSON \nAw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob. \n189. CLOSEUP - CLARK \nCLARK \nNo. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've \nwrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president. \n190. CLOSEUP - DICKSON \nDICKSON \n(quietly - tense) \nSo, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? \n(his voice rising) \nWell, I'm not going to resign now - or ever. \n191. WIDER ANGLE \nTaking in the others at the table. \nSCHULTZ \nYou have no choice. \nDICKSON \nI haven't? I'll shut the bank first. \nCLARK \n(terrified) \nSay, you can't do that\u0097 \nDICKSON \nI can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill. \nWith which ultimatum, he crosses to the door and exits, CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM. \nCUT TO: \n192. INT. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson barges out. He stops in front of the door, and looks off toward lobby. \n193. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - FULL SHOT \nPandemonium has broken loose. Men and women are hysterical. The police battle with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate effort to maintain order. Strong men push weak ones out of the lines. Wild-eyed women jostle and scramble to get near the paying tellers. Sex and priority rights are totally disregarded. Above it all the din is deafening. Men and women are clamoring for their life's savings, ready to commit murder to retrieve their little stakes. \nCUT TO: \n194. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSEUP - DICKSON \nHis face clouds. As he stands there watching the chaos, slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and his jaw sets in grim determination. He starts toward the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n195. ENTRANCE OF BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nCyril Cluett enters from outside, looking guiltily around. Then he starts forward and exits from scene.

MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nAs Detective #3 enters the room. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to the Inspector. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat did you find out, Mike? \nMIKE \nI've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere. \nINSPECTOR \nNever mind all that. What did you find out? \nMIKE \nHe left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint. \nINSPECTOR \nDude Finlay? \nMIKE \nYes, sir. \n204. CLOSE SHOT - MATT & HELEN \nHelen slowly lifts her head from Matt's shoulder. Her eyes widen as she hears the name of Dude Finlay. Mike's voice comes over this shot. \nMIKE'S VOICE \nHe stayed about half an hour, and then he came right back here. He's in his office now. \nINSPECTOR \n(slowly dawning realization) \nThat's where I must have seen that guy\u0097 \nHelen starts out of scene. \n205. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Helen leaves Matt's side and crosses to the Inspector and Mike. \nHELEN \nDid you say Dude Finlay? \nINSPECTOR \nYes, why? \nHELEN \nHe was in the bank yesterday. \n206. CLOSER SHOT ON THE THREE \nINSPECTOR \n(suddenly alert) \nHe was here? \nHELEN \nHe came to see Mr. Cluett. \nINSPECTOR \nAre you sure? \nHELEN \nYes, sir. \n207. CLOSE SHOT - MATT \nAs he listens intently to Helen and the Inspector. \nINSPECTOR'S VOICE \nWho was with him? \nHELEN'S VOICE \nTwo other men. They all went into Mr. Cluett's private office. \nINSPECTOR'S VOICE \n(pleased) \nNow we're beginning to get somewhere. \n208. MED. SHOT \nTaking in all the people in the room. The Inspector turns to the detective and speaks quickly: \nINSPECTOR \nKelly! You stay here with Brown. \n(to Tim) \nTim, you and Mike come with me. We're going down to Cluett's office. \nHe crosses to the door, followed by Tim and Mike. \n209. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nAs the Inspector turns back and calls: \nINSPECTOR \nOh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett's office in about five minutes. \nKELLY'S VOICE \nWhat'll I say? \nINSPECTOR \nI don't care what you say. Sing \"Mother Machree\"[8] if you want to, but call me up. \nInspector, Tim and Mike go out. \nCUT TO: \n210. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nOn the elderly lady depositor and bank guard, among the milling crowd. \nGUARD \n(above the din) \nQuiet down, please! Take it easy, folks.

Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please! \nGUARD \nPlease, lady. Please be quiet.

DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT DICKSON \nSeated at his desk, talking into the phone: \nDICKSON \nGood heavens, man, you're taking no chances. No, I'm perfectly willing to sign everything over to you. What more do you want? I need action. I've got to have it within the next half hour. \n(pause) \nYeah, sure - the board of directors turned me down, but you know why. \nWell! Did Dude Finlay tell you that? \nCUT TO: \n219. INT.

He glances around the room quickly to determine his chances to escape. He keeps edging closer to the door with his back to it. His hands sneaks down and grabs hold of the doorknob. \nSuddenly, Cluett snaps open the door and like a flash is out of the room. \n222. MED. SHOT OF ROOM \nAs Cluett's figure disappears. The detectives are startled by the sudden move. \nINSPECTOR \n(hanging up receiver) \n\u0097get him! \nThe detectives dash out, Inspector following. \nCUT TO: \n223.

MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - FULL SHOT \nMetal lockers line the entire room. Cluett comes to door on other side of the room. Just as he gets there, he hears the detectives entering off scene. Quickly he changes his mind and springs into a space between a row of lockers and the wall, at the same time drawing his gun. \nInspector and detectives enter. The Inspector and one of the detectives advance into the room cautiously, holding their guns in front of them. Kelley, the other detective, shrewdly separates from them. \nDETECTIVE \nHe must be here. There's only one door. \nINSPECTOR \nAll right. Find him. \nCluett slips into a locker and closes the door behind him. They hear the noise off scene. \nINSPECTOR \nWhat was that noise? \nDETECTIVE \nSounded like a locker. \nINSPECTOR \nA locker, eh? Well, search every one of them. He must be in one of 'em. \nThey search the lockers one by one, until the Inspector happens upon the one with Cluett inside. He leaps out, gun drawn. \n227. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT \nFrom Inspector's angle. \nCLUETT \nStand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun. \nINSPECTOR \n(calming tone) \nAll right, Jack, all right. \n228. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe detective and Inspector. The detective drops his gun, but the Inspector keeps his levelled, toward Cluett, off scene: \nINSPECTOR \nDon't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you. \nCLUETT \nStand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you! \nHe starts slowly forward. \nThe Inspector ignores the warning. He takes a few more steps forward. \n229. CLOSEUP - CLUETT \nFrom Inspector's angle. \nCLUETT \nI warn you, Inspector - I'll shoot! \nHe levels his gun. \n230. CLOSEUP - KELLEY \nHe lifts his gun and aims for Cluett, off scene. \n231. CLOSEUP - CLUETT \nHe is frightened, but desperate.

What's she got to do with you? \nINSPECTOR \n(out of the side of his mouth - to a detective standing next to him) \nNo wonder he didn't want to mention her name. \nDickson comes over to Cluett, grabs him by the arm. \nDICKSON \nWhat was my wife doing in your apartment last night? \nCLUETT \n(hysterically) \nNothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying. \nDICKSON \nYou just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment? \nCLUETT \nShe just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes. \nDickson grabs Cluett and shakes him. \nDICKSON \n(a shriek) \nYou're lying! \n243. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nINSPECTOR \nDon't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth.

Wait a minute. \nCAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to his desk, and calls Helen on the intercom. \nDICKSON \nHelen! \nHELEN'S VOICE \nYes? \nDICKSON \nGet Mrs. Dickson on the phone. \nThere is an awkward pause while Dickson waits. He is obviously agitated. Then the phone rings. \nDICKSON \n(answering it) \nListen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? \nCUT TO: \n244. INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS. DICKSON \nMRS. DICKSON \n(into phone - disconcerted) \nLast night?

She didn't\u0097 \nDICKSON \n(an explosion) \nGet out, get out! \nINSPECTOR \nAll right. Let's go. \nThe detectives get on either side of Cluett and silently they march him out of the room. Inspector and others follow, leaving Dickson alone. When they have gone out: \n248. CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON \nLeft alone, he is a tragic figure. An incessant parade of disturbing thoughts tumble over each other in a hectic march across his chaotic mind. He grips his throbbing temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought that Phyllis was involved in an intrigue with Cyril Cluett. \nCUT TO: \n249. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT \nMost of the directors seem to be weakening. O'Brien is remaining staunch to Dickson. Clark alone, holds out. \nO'BRIEN \nClark, you're insane to hold out any longer. Now let's get some money over here and stop this run. \nAMES \nIf we close our doors, our stock won't be worth a nickel. \nMeek little Ives once more tries to speak: \nIVES \nMy dear friends, I\u0097 \nO'BRIEN \n(interrupting) \nI'll lay you ten to one, Dickson won't give in. \n250. CLOSER SHOT \nFeaturing Schultz and Clark, standing together. \nSCHULTZ \nMaybe they're right, Clark. \nCLARK \n(weakening) \nAll right, I'll go and have a talk with him. \nPlease, Matt. \nHead bowed, Matt exits scene. \nCUT TO: \n258. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MATT AND HELEN \nImmediately following: \nHELEN \nDid you talk to him? \nMATT \n(downcast) \nYeah. \n(he has a sudden inspiration) \nI got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone. \nThey exit scene hurriedly. \nCUT TO: \n259. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSEUP \nAll of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his desk, gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk. \nAlso in the desk drawer is - he cannot help but notice - a gun. \nCUT TO: \n260. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - CLARK \nAs he dictates to someone off screen: \nCLARK \n\u0097a thirty-day option on ten thousand shares of stock of this company, now registered in the name of Thomas A. Dickson. Now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as you can. Hurry! \nCUT TO: \n261. INT. SOMEWHERE IN THE BANK - CLOSE SHOT AT PAYROLL WINDOW \nShooting past cashier in f.g. towards line of laborers waiting to be paid. \nCashier stands in front of a tall counter upon which is a small metal box filled with currency. He is speaking into the phone by his side as scene opens. \nHe hangs up receiver and turns to the men on the other side of the window. \nCASHIER \n(speaking thru small window) \nSorry ladies and gentlemen, there's no more money. You'll have to go on to the next window. \nHe snaps the window shut, slams down cover of little metal box. \nAngry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting to be paid. \nCUSTOMER AD-LIBS \nWhat do you mean there's no more money? etc. \nPanicked shouting and pushing. In the center of the crowd, a woman faints. \nCUT TO: \nAnother cashier, another window, another angry line of depositors. \nCASHIER \nThat's all there is! \nMore pushing, shouting, angry ad-lib. \nCUT TO: \n262. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nPhyllis Dickson, serious-faced, comes up steps and thru ante room on the way to Dickson's private office. \nShe pounds on door of office. There is no reply from within. Standing next to her is a bank guard, uncertain about what to do. Throughout scene, there are b.g. sounds of melee in the bank. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(to bank guard) \nAre you sure he's in there? \nGUARD \nYes, ma'am. He must be in there. He hasn't come out. \nShe pounds on the door again. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(shouting) \nTom! Tom! Tom! \n(to guard) \nI've got to get in there. Can't you find me a key? \nGUARD \n(reaching into Helen's desk) \nYes, I think there's one right here in the drawer. \nCUT TO: \n263. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT \nAs Mrs. Dickson rushes in. \nDickson is standing by a window. \n264. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON \nShe walks over to him - CAMERA PANNING WITH HER - and stands in back of him. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(softly - seriously) \nTom! Oh Tom, darling - I came to explain about last night . . . \nDickson remains silent. Mrs. Dickson continues: \nMRS. DICKSON \nCyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to me, Tom. I went out with him last night simply because . . . well, I had begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life. That I was an outsider. Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, and then we went back to his apartment afterward for a drink. That's all it was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom. I couldn't do anything wrong. I love you too much. You know that. \n265. CLOSEUP - DICKSON \nAs he stares dully out the window. \nMrs. Dickson's voice coming over shot: \nMRS. DICKSON \n(breaking down - sobbing) \nOh, Tom! Tom! \nCUT TO: \n266. INT. SOMEWHERE IN BANK - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - MATT AND HELEN \nFavoring Matt. \nThey are furiously working two phones, going down a list of people who owe Dickson and the bank a favor. \nAlthough Matt has focus in the scene, Helen's voice is always in b.g., as she handles calls, making the same pitch. \nMATT \n(into phone - rat-a-tat) \nDickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse. \nHELEN \nDickson flings the door open. Clark and the other directors are startled out of their business. Clark holds the necessary transfer papers in his hand. \nDICKSON \nCome out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this! \nCLARK \nWe've been waiting fifteen minutes\u0097 \nDICKSON \n(waving papers away) \nYou know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world. \nWhile he has been speaking, several of the directors have edged over to the door. They are perceptibly impressed. \n277. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK \nHe has remained unmoved, staring at Dickson, as if trying to determine what kind of ruse is this. \nDICKSON'S VOICE \nCome on boys! Come on Clark! It'll do your heart good. \nCAMERA PANS WITH CLARK, as he crosses slowly to the door and looks out. \nDICKSON \nLook at that. They're shoving their hard-earned money across the counter with a ten to one chance against them. \n278. CLOSER SHOT OF GROUP \nAs they edge out onto balcony overlooking scene. \nDICKSON \nIf you fellas want to save this bank, get some real money over here right away. \nO'BRIEN \n(decisively) \nThat's enough for me, Dickson. I'm ashamed of myself. I'll have a hundred thousand dollars over here in five minutes. \nO'Brien starts away and crosses to a phone. \nDickson turns to the others. \nDICKSON \nNow you're talking! Ames? \nAMES \nI'm sold. \nHe goes off. \nDICKSON \nAll right. Schultz? \nSCHULTZ \n(only a moment's hesitation) \nThis is your bank, Dickson, and I'm with you! \nDICKSON \nIves? \n279. CLOSE SHOT - IVES \nAt last he can say something. \nIVES \n(shaky voice) \nMy dear friends, that's what I've been trying to say all afternoon. \nDICKSON \nGo ahead and say it. \n(turning to Clark) \nClark, you can do twice as much as any of them. How about you? \n280. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK \nCLARK \nOh, I don't agree with you, but if everybody's gone crazy, I'll go crazy too! \nCUT TO: \n281. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SERIES OF CLOSEUPS \nAs Clark and the other directors make their urgent phone calls. \nSCHULTZ \n(into phone) \nThis is Ben Schultz talking. Send a hundred thousand cash over here to the Union National right away. \nCLARK \n(into phone) \nSend all your available cash to Union National! \nAMES \n(into phone) \nCurrency - small denominations\u0097 \nCLARK \n(into phone) \n\u0097in tens and twenties\u0097 \nIVES \n(into phone) \nSay, I want one hundred and fifty thousand dollars over here right away. \n(listens) \nI am in my right mind. No, no, no. Not one hundred and fifty dollars. Say, listen you guys, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Yes! \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n282. EXT. CITY STREET - LONG SHOT \nA string of armored cars speed toward camera, accompanied by an escort of eight motorcycle cops. The procession heralds its approach by the piercing wail of sirens. \nPOLICEMAN \nOpen up! \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n283. INT. BANK - AT THE DOOR \nA dozen policemen precede the entrance of a parade of uniformed guards, who carry in one hand sacks of money, their other hands clasped firmly on their guns. The crowd in the lobby stands aside, awe-stricken. \nAD-LIB FROM COPS \nHeads up\u0097 \nMake way, there\u0097 \nHey, you, look out! \nMurmurs of approval are heard from the crowd. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n284.

Everyone is smiling and happy. \n", "test1_input": "MATT \n(catches himself in time) \nA friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it? \n31. CLOSE SHOT \nShooting toward Matt. \nAs she interrupts him: \nHELEN \nNo. \nMATT \nOh, you think I'm lying? \nHELEN \nYes. \nMATT \nAll right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar. \nHELEN \nOh, Matt. \nHe reaches forward and takes her hands. \nMATT \nOh honey, why don't we get married? Then you can handle it all. \nJust then Oscar enters the scene, en route somewhere. He stops beside Matt, notices he and Helen are holding hands. \n32. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Helen and Matt separate guiltily. \nOSCAR \nSay, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news? \nMATT \nNo, what? \nOSCAR \nPardon me. All the big shots are in a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's out on his ear. \nHelen and Matt react to this piece of news. They look at one another. Apparently, it will have a definite effect on their lives. \nMATT \n(to Oscar) \nOh, you're kidding me, aren't you? \nOSCAR \nNo, I'm not kidding. Everybody's talking about it. Ask her. \nHELEN \nI haven't heard about it. \nOSCAR \nSure, everybody's talking about it. \n33. CLOSE UP - MATT \nAs he speaks sadly. \nMATT \nIf that's on the level, there goes my assistant cashier's job. \n34. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nTaking the three in. \nOSCAR \nWell, I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit. \nAs he turns to go out of scene, he looks at Matt. \nOSCAR \nI'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline. \nCUT TO: \n35. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM MED. - SHOT \nThe men are all gathered around the table now. Apparently, they have been discussing ways and means of ousting Dickson. \nAs we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring himself a glass of water. \nIVES \nThat ham I had this morning was very salty\u0097 \n36. CLOSER SHOT ON THE GROUP \nCLARK \nGentlemen, let's get organized before Dickson gets here. Schultz, can I count on you? \n37. CLOSE SHOT \nOn Schultz, who is seated next to Clark. \nSCHULTZ \nAbsolutely. \nCLARK \nWhat about you, Ames? \n38. CLOSE SHOT \nOn Ames, who is seated next to Schultz. \nAMES \nThat's the way I feel about it. \nCLARK \nIves, how about you? \n39. CLOSE SHOT \nIVES \nWell, the way I look at it, it seems that\u0097 \nCLARK \n(interrupting) \nAll right. O'Brien? \n40. CLOSE SHOT \nAt other end of table, where O'Brien is. \nO'BRIEN \nWell, you've got an awful fight on your hands. That's all I've got to say. \n41. CLOSE SHOT \nOn Clark, determined. \nCLARK \nGentlemen, I think it's time that we do fight. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "The outer offices of the bank are in this shot. A spacious stretch of desks occupied by clerks and junior officers, all busily at work. \nA wizened old doorman is greeting clerks as they arrive. \nCLERK \n(passing by) \nHello, Gardiner. \nGARDINER \nGood morning. You're on time this morning. It's about time. \nWe see Dickson, looming in the doorway, for the first time. \n43. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Dickson stops to speak to the doorman. Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose looks belie his years. There is a robustness and virility about him that is compelling. His very walk radiates power. \nHe now puts his hand on the old man's shoulder. \nGARDINER \nGood morning, Mr. Dickson. \nDICKSON \nJohn, how's your wife this morning? \nGARDINER \n(looking up, worship in his eyes) \nMuch better this morning, thank you. \nDICKSON \nGot a handkerchief? \nGardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief, and starts to blow his nose. \nGARDINER \nExcuse me\u0097 \nDICKSON \nWait a minute. \n(he takes the handkerchief, and polishes the brass on Gardiner's uniform) \nHow do you feel this morning? \nGARDINER \nI'm feeling fine this morning. \nDICKSON \nThat makes it unanimous. I feel all right too. \nGARDINER \nThank you! \nAs Dickson exits from scene: \nCUT TO: \n44. TRUCKING SHOT WITH DICKSON \nThe smile on his face disappears as he sees something which annoys him. \nDICKSON \n(sternly) \nOh, Carter! \nA young man looks up quickly. He is smoking a cigarette. \nCARTER \nYes sir? \nDICKSON \nYou know the rules about smoking . . \nCarter quickly crushes out the cigarette. Even as he does so, Dickson reaches into his pocket and flips Carter a fresh one, which Carter pockets for later. \nCARTER \nThank you, sir. \nNow Dickson passes Matt's cage. \nDICKSON \n(catching Matt's attention) \nOh, Matt! \nMatt looks up. Dickson tosses him a wink, and Matt winks back. \nDickson walks on towards his office. CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM. On the way he is greeted by his employees. \nAD-LIB FROM EMPLOYEES \nGood morning, Mr. Dickson. Etc., etc. \nDICKSON \n(pleasantly) \nMorning. Good morning\u0097 \nHe is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend of his. Bill walks along with Dickson. \nBILL \nHello, Tom. \nDICKSON \n(firmly, but pleasantly) \nYou here again? What do you want? \nHe does not stop. Continues his walk toward his office. Bill along-side of him. \nBILL \n(smiling) \nWhat do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money! \nDICKSON \nListen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I? \nBILL \nI want to know why . \nDickson notices a man, a janitor without a uniform, passing by. \nDICKSON \n(to the man) \nWait a minute. Where's your uniform? \nJANITOR \nI haven't any. \nDICKSON \nYou haven't got a uniform? \nJANITOR \nNo, sir. \nDICKSON \nMy goodness, you ought to have a uniform.

CLOSEUP - CLUETT \nHe is suddenly reminded of his pact with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to his face. \nCLUETT \nTonight? \nHe suddenly gets an idea. He was told to be with someone around midnight. Someone who would be an alibi for him. He stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why not? \nMRS. DICKSON \n(continuing) \nDoesn't that come next? \n89. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nCLUETT \nYes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis? \nMRS. DICKSON \nSee, we're getting along famously! \nCUT TO: \n90. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM SHOT \nClark is in a state of agitation. The other directors seem worn by the ordeal. Dickson remains adamant. \nDICKSON \nMost of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them. \nCLARK \nI know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency! \n91. CLOSER SHOT AT THE TABLE \nAll the men in the scene. \nDICKSON \nI know what you mean by that. You want me to hang on to our cash. Well, I don't believe in it. The law demands that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I'm doing it. The rest of our money is out working . . . working to help industry . . . to help build up business \n92. CLOSEUP - CLARK \nAs he almost shouts at Dickson. \nCLARK \nIn the meantime, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank. Well, we won't stand for it! \n93. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nOf the group, as Dickson turns to Clark. \nDICKSON \nYou have to stand for it. \nMeek little Ives once again tries to say something: \nIVES \n(exhausted) \nBut my dear friends . . . \nSCHULTZ \n(interrupting) \nYou're forcing us to take action against you, Dickson. \nDickson looks at him: \nDICKSON \nGo ahead - take all the action you want! \nHe looks about at the others as he continues: \nDICKSON \nI'm running this bank my way. Get that clear! \nCLARK \nGentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith! \nDICKSON \nYes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me. \n94. CLOSEUP - CLARK \nAs Dickson's voice continues. Clark reacts appropriately. \nDICKSON'S VOICE \nBefore I take a man into this bank, and before I extend credit to anyone, I satisfy myself on one thing - do I believe in him? \n95. CLOSE PAN SHOT \nOn the other men - CAMERA PANNING from one to the other as Dickson's voice comes over the shot - finally CAMERA STOPS on Dickson. \nDICKSON \nSo far, my judgement has been right one hundred per cent. One hundred per cent! When I start going wrong, you won't have to take any action. I'll turn the bank over to you. Then you can \nmerge all you want to. I won't be the fellow to run it then. Good day, gentlemen! \nHe exits scene. \nCAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as Dickson passes briskly through his outer office, stopping only to speak to Helen at her desk: \nDICKSON \n(cheerfully) \nHelen, tell Matt I want to see him. \nHELEN \nYes, sir. \nCUT TO: \n96.

I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly. \nCLUETT \n(simply) \nPlease, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight! \n97. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO \nFavoring Mrs. Dickson. \n", "test2_true": "Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have reserved for a very special occasion. Believe it or not, it's our wedding anniversary. Tom doesn't probably even remember it. But then, they never do, do they? \nCLUETT'S VOICE \nNo, they don't\u0097 \nShe shakes her head. \nMRS. DICKSON \nBut I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months. \nCLUETT \n(after a pause) \nWell\u0097 \nMRS. DICKSON \n(smiling) \nWell, what? \nCLUETT \n(he won't give up) \nWell, aren't you going to invite me? \nMRS. DICKSON \n(surprised) \nYou? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends. \nCLUETT \nNow Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway. \nMRS. DICKSON \nDon't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death. \nCLUETT \n(desperate-sounding) \nNo, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(flattered, but a little suspicious) \nWhy are you so anxious? \nCLUETT \n(intense sincerity) \nDon't you know? \nMRS. DICKSON \nNo. \nCLUETT \nI want to be near you! \nHe steps closer to her. \nMRS. DICKSON \nWhat? \nCLUETT \nDon't you know I've been crazy about you for years? \nMRS. DICKSON \n(still flattered, lightly) \nNow wait a minute, wait a minute . . \nCLUETT \nI've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson. \nMRS. DICKSON \n(still only half-believing) \nWhy, Cyril, you're insane\u0097 \nCLUETT \nNo. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer\u0097 \nMRS. DICKSON \nCyril! \nBefore she realizes what has happened, he has swept her into his arms and crushes her to him. CAMERA PANS AWAY from them to the door to the outer office. The door opens and Matt steps in. He stops, suddenly, transfixed by what he sees off scene. \n98. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nPhyllis Dickson in Cluett's arms (from Matt's angle). They suddenly become conscious of someone in the room and Phyllis struggles free, looking off scene toward Matt: \nCUT TO: \n99. CLOSE SHOT - MATT \nFrom Cluett and Mrs. Dickson's angle. \nHe stares unbelievingly for a moment, and then collecting himself, turns and leaves the room, closing the door after him. CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. For a moment she is terribly upset. \nCLUETT \nPlease forgive me, Phyllis. I lost my head for a minute. But I couldn't help it, Phyllis. \nAs she starts for the door, CAMERA PANS WITH HER. Cluett walks with her. \nMRS. DICKSON \nPlease stop apologizing so much. You're making it far too important. \nAs they reach the door. \nCUT TO: \n100. INT. ANTE ROOM OF CLUETT'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT \nMatt stands there, in a daze. Cluett's secretary is not there. He starts slowly forward, hardly knowing where he is going - CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF HIM - there is a far-away look in his eyes. His hand clutches the list of payrolls but as far as he is concerned, it is entirely forgotten. Several people talk to him, but Matt walks on heedlessly. He can't get over the shock of what he just saw. He always had been under the impression that Dickson's home life was a happy one. He never dreamed that Phyllis Dickson represented anything but the height of circumspection. And now - Cyril Cluett, of all people! \nHelen comes running into scene, all excited. \nHELEN \n(happily) \nMatt, where have you been? Mr. Dickson wants to see you right away. Hurry up! \nHe turns around mechanically and continues to walk in the direction of Dickson's office - CAMERA TRUCKING AFTER HIM. Helen falls into step with him. \nHELEN \nSay, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand? \nMATT \n(tonelessly) \nYeah, swell. \nThey reach Dickson's outer office. Matt crosses it and exits into the private office. Helen looks after him - her face falls in disappointment. Matt is acting very strangely. She thought he'd be elated. She stares unhappily at his forlorn figure as it disappears thru the door. \nCUT TO: \n101. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. SHOT \nDickson sits at his desk when Matt enters. When he sees Matt, his face breaks into a broad, pleasant smile. \nDICKSON \n(grandly) \nWell, Matt, get ready for the big moment. Starting tomorrow you become assistant cashier. How's that? \n", "test2_id": 2029, "test3_input": "DICKSON \n(assuringly) \nHappy now? \nMRS. DICKSON \n(mock-pouting) \nNo. \n116.

I love you, anyway. \nA buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers the intercom. \nDICKSON \nYes? \nHELEN'S VOICE \nMr. Sampson . . . \nDICKSON \nAll right. Send him in. \nThere is a knock on the door. Dickson moves away from his wife. He looks toward the door. \n117. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR \nSampson, an executive in the bank, enters. Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers in his hand. He lays the papers on the desk before Dickson. \nDICKSON \nWell, Sampson, what is it? \nSAMPSON \nHere's the data on the Clyde deal. \n118. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK \nDickson is all absorbed. \nDICKSON \nGood. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay. \nSAMPSON \nI'm afraid he's been stalling. \nDICKSON \nThat's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . . \nSAMPSON \nHe says he can't get away in the daytime. \nDICKSON \nHow about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off. \nSAMPSON \nYes, sir. \n120. CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS DICKSON \nShe stands by a window, listening. There is despair in her look as she hears him making arrangements for tomorrow night. Dickson's voice comes over this shot: \nDICKSON'S VOICE \nI'm sick and tired of these people dilly-dallying. People who can't make up their minds \nMrs. Dickson's eyes close hopelessly, and she feels defeated. Again shut out from his scheme of things, she realizes he is incurable. On this picture of resignation: \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nINSERT: CLOCK OVER THE VAULT, reading \nCAMERA PANS DOWN to open vault. \n121. INT. VAULT - MED. SHOT \nInside, several of the tellers are putting their cash away. One of them is just entering with his truck. \nMATT \nEverybody in? \nTELLER \nI guess so. \nMATT \nWhere's Charlie? \nTELLER \n(amused) \nCharlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it. \nAD-LIB VOICES \nGood night. Good night, Matt. \nCUT TO: \n122. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT \nCyril Cluett is standing at the bottom of a spiral staircase from which he has just descended. He stops a second and watches Matt, off scene. Cluett has gloves on, his hat in his hand, preparatory to going home. Matt does not see Charlie. \nCUT TO: \n123. OUTSIDE OF THE VAULT - CLOSE SHOT \nMatt and Helen standing near the vault door. \nHELEN \nWhat's keeping you? \nMATT \nOh, Charlie again. \nHELEN \nSay Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? \nMATT \n(still upset) \nWho? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff-necked, horse dollar.[6] \nHELEN \nOh now, don't be silly. \nMATT \n(disgusted) \nCan you imagine that guy? He was kissing her. \nHELEN \nNow you've got me worried, dear. \n", "test3_true": "Promise me you won't butt in. \nMATT \nOkay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that\u0097 \nShe puts her hand over her mouth: \nHELEN \nShh . . . ! \n(whispering) \nI'll wait for you upstairs. \nMATT \nAll right, dear. \nShe leaves. Matt remains standing, a far-away look in his eyes. It is obvious he is thinking about the thing seriously. \n124. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe boys who were inside the vault now file out, having properly locked away their cash. At the same time, Charlie wheels in his truck. \nMATT \n(kidding him) \nWhere you been? \nCHARLIE \n(annoyed) \nWhere do you think I've been? \n(pointing to truck) \nI took the baby for a stroll in the park. \nThe men hurry out of sight, laughing.

"Theyre on me! Shit! Losing power!" 
NIOBES Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something  on a console. 
CIRCA 
"Multiple bogies closing!" 
NIOBE 
"No shit." 
CIRCA 
"From the front!" 
Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several  objects are closing in fast. 
CIRCA 
"Are they - " 
She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters launch a massive  volley of missiles.  From afar, they  look like dark irises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  At first,  we can't   tell exactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the SEPHORA cockpit. 
CIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by. 
INT. NEB COCKPIT 
A massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit. The individual warheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing  SQUIDDIES apart,  or casting them to the ground aflame. 
INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT 
Niobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a wing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  with huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage. 
NIOBE 
"They're ours." 
DEFENDER ONE (V.O.) 
"Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning." 
EXT. THE SURFACE 
The wing  of DEFENDERS  makes short  work of  the squiddies.  The half dozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser shots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. The squiddies that survive turn tail and run. 
INT. NEB COCKPIT 
The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave the scene of aerial carnage behind them. 
NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters a cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into the earth. 
TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair. 
TANK 
"We're home." 
TRINITY 
"Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen." 
NEO 
"What's that?" 
MORPHEUS 
"A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that just saved us constitute the first ring." 
NIOBE (V.O.) 
"Neb crew, you can relax now." 
MORPHEUS 
"For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home." 
FADE OUT 
and 
FADE INTO: 
TRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of loved ones. 
Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him with her head on his lap. 
Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing as they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch, Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. 
Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the photo. 
She awakens. 
TRINITY 
"I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."

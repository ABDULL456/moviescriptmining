DAVE WILKIE Well, I tell you, I don't know what the world's come to these days. Things used to be better. We didn't have any money, but things were better. (grimaces in anger) Goddamn niggers and kikes burning the flag, rioting, raising hell -- they ought to shoot their asses off. I tell you, Buddy, where this country made its mistake was allowing people without property to vote. 
During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY 
A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain. 
DAVE WILKIE (holds out hand) Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy. 
WILLCOX HILLYER Yeah, I'll do that, Dave. 
DAVE WILKIE (sweating, tense, under some kind of awful emotional strain) Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you? 
WILLCOX HILLYER (a trifle wearily) Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years. 
Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag. In desperation, Dave takes his arm. 
DAVE WILKIE Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a heart attack last year, I wasn't expected to live. 
Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly explains. 
DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D) You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters. 
WILLCOX HILLYER (in a different tone, interested, curious) What do you want me to tell her, Dave? 
DAVE WILKIE (a painful inward struggle; the man is tormented, miserable) Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me. (half turns his back, his face twisted with strong emotion) Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane. 
Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half to himself, half to the Hertz Girl. 
WILLCOX HILLYER He still loves her. The poor damn fool still loves her. 
HERTZ GIRL Who was she? 
WILLCOX HILLYER A girl named Rose. (pulls himself back into the world of reality) Still take R75 to Glenville? 
HERTZ GIRL Yes, sir. 
Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag. 
EXT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - ROAD - DAY 
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford driving from the airport. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 75 - DAY 
A shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in b.g. 
EXT. GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY 
On the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate through red clay hills in green springtime. 
INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY 
CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation. Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK: 
EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY 
A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he shades his eyes to look at something far away. 
EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces herself to walk on. 
EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH 
CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless, unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a mannerism of his father's. Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands there, waiting. 
EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY 
CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she is nervous and frightened. 
ROSE Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to live with you and your family. 
Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen, Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot. He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile. 
ROSE (CONT'D) What's your name? What do they call you?

DEADPOOL Santa Claus is coming... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
45    OMITTED                                                             45 
46    INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PAST                                 46 
DEADPOOL (O.S.) ...to town! 
DEADPOOL has ONE LEG in his COSTUME and the other LEG still stabbing for the other pants-hole. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Late-late-late-late-late! 
He HOPS ACROSS the hall past BLIND AL, not really paying attention to her. We're revisiting the moment from earlier JUST AFTER she TRIPS on Deadpool's DUFFEL of AMMUNITION, PICKS it up, and DRAGS it OFF. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry! 
BLIND AL I hope you're doing us the courtesy of pants. 
47    EXT.   CITY STREET - DAY - PAST                                     47 
DEADPOOL runs out to the street corner and WAVES. 
DEADPOOL Taxi! 
A TAXI - if you've been paying attention, you will recognize it - pulls up to the curb. Deadpool opens the rear door. A WOMAN steps out, pausing to pay Dopinder. 
WOMAN Keep the change. 
Deadpool frowns. The woman is pulling her money from a BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE. Deadpool's eyes raise from the purse to the woman holding it: BERNADETTE PETERS HERSELF! Deadpool doubletakes, then shakes his head (`Nah, couldn't be...') and climbs into the cab. Who is behind the wheel but... 
DOPINDER Where do you want to be going!

DEADPOOL (looks to camera) And we all know how this turned out. Cue Benny Hill speed... 
The action goes into Benny-Hill-like HYPER-SPEED as we relive the opening scenes of the movie: DEADPOOL's CAB RIDE. AJAX crumpling up his orange jumpsuit and switching places with a motorcycle RIDER at the RAFT. The FREEWAY FIGHT with AJAX's GOONS. The CONFRONTATION with COLOSSUS. Until at last... 
VRS48   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                              VRS48 
Transport TRUCKS idle in the loading dock. 
A docile SUPER-SLAVE, fitted with a control collar and cuffs, steps into a CRATE IDENTICAL to the ONES AJAX DELIVERED TO THE WARLORD in ACT ONE. He lies down. 
ANGEL DUST is overseeing.      She plunges a pistol-grip syringe into his neck and fires: 
ANGEL DUST For your flight. 
The man's eyelids flutter shut. Next to him, four identical crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up into the truck. 
ANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns at the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer. 
Ajax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe. 
He steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letting it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank. 
AJAX (O.S.) Quit showing off, Angel. 
Angel doesn't seem surprised by his dirty and bloodied appearance. A raised eyebrow and a disapproving look is all she has for her boss. 
RSA48   INT.   WAREHOUSE - DAY                                            RSA48 
A WAREHOUSE full of SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. OVERHEAD LAMPS. FABRIC TENTS. CHROME TABLES, one of which Ajax sits on. 
AJAX Wade Fucking Wilson.

ANGEL DUST stands in front of him, putting stitches into his GORY MESS of a SHOULDER WOUND. 
He doesn't so much as FLINCH. 
ANGEL DUST Makes perfect sense. 
AJAX I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too. (Angel finishes final stitch) Only wish I mended the same. 
Ajax pops off the table.     Swings his arm around, testing his shoulder. 
AJAX (CONT'D) Not to worry. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms. 
ANGEL DUST And if he heals? 
AJAX He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual. 
Ajax's hand is a blur as he plucks the MATCHSTICK from Angel's mouth.

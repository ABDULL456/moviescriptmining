EXT. - ADAM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Taka is bowing and smiling and nodding to someone we don't see. 
TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back. 
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers. Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is on her face and clothes. 
KENNY Adam Kesher...he... 
LORRAINE Yeah, right ... get lost! 
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open once again. Kenny enters the house. 
KENNY This is Adam Kesher's house. Where... 
LORRAINE Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!! 
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with pink paint. 
GENE I guess you don't understand English. She asked to leave. Here's the door. 
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door. Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed - his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there. Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the floor. 
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box - spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

Kenny jumps into the front seat of the limo. Vincenzo and Luigi nod to the driver and they take off. 
Taka hoes some weeds beneath a Jacaranda. 
CUT TO: 
L.A. AERIAL SHOT HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT 
Night descends on Los Angeles. Millions of lights down below twinkle like stars. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST - NIGHT 
We see the courtyard at night. Some of the apartment windows have dim, warm lights. Most all is in darkness. The only sound is the water flowing in the fountain with muted distant traffic. Far away a siren wails softly. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Betty and Rita are on their hands and knees around the coffee table. A map of L.A. is unfolded and Betty is running her finger along a street. Her finger stops. 
BETTY It's right about here on Sierra Bonita. That's not too far away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COURTYARD - SIMULTANEOUS 
An older, beautiful woman - drunk, is walking slowly - strangely toward the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment.

REF Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards... (to himself) ... times three... that's forty-five yards. Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards. That makes it sixty yards. Unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards... that's, wait... forty-five... no, thirty... (turns to another ref) ... how many yards so far? 
ON BALL 
A ref is taking a very long walk with it. He stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts it down. 
IN HUDDLE 
Shane leans in. 
SHANE Okay, everybody, stick 
together and don't take any shit. Let's make 'em hurt! 
They break the huddle and line up with their backs to their goal. 
ON COCHRAN AND BUTLER 
Butler is still whining. 
BUTLER I can't believe you went for my eyes! 
COCHRAN Shut up! I'm gonna do it again 'cause it was fun! 
ON SHANE 
SHANE Black 98! Black 98! Hut! 
ON COCHRAN 
He drops Butler with a vicious forearm. 
Shane flicks the ball over the middle to Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and a first down. 
CUT TO: 
MONTAGE - FOURTH QUARTER STUFF 
A)    BATEMAN 
(now at running back) sweeps outside with Jamal and Reese Evans leading the way. Both linemen growl as they throw themselves into the defense. 
B)    SHANE 
is rolling right with Butler on his heels. Just when it looks like Butler has him, Cochran comes out of nowhere and 
cuts Butler at the knees. Shane fakes a throw and keeps the ball for a fifteen- yard gain. 
C)   SHANE 
hits Franklin with a short flick pass. 
D)   BATEMAN 
runs off tackle and scores. 
E)   PACIFICO 
kicks the extra point.     Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 7. 
F)   WILKINSON 
blitzes from his safety position and decks the Dallas quarterback. 
G)   BATEMAN 
stops a runner at the line of scrimmage and throws him for a loss. 
H)   WILKINSON 
takes a punt at his own thirty. With Bateman blocking, Wilkinson springs to the outside and goes all the way for a touchdown. 
Pacifico kicks the extra point. Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 14. 
I)   DALLAS FIELD GOAL KICKER 
is set to boot one. The ball is snapped, the kicker moves forward and suddenly Brian Murray breaks through the offense and blocks the kick. 
J)   SHANE 
hits Franklin on a little down and out. He's hit by the defender, the ball goes flying but so does a flag. 
Pass interference.   Redskin first down. 
K)   ON CLOCK 
Four minutes six seconds remain. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HUDDLE - DAY 
The Redskin huddle breaks.   The guys come to the line of scrimmage. 
AL (V.O.) First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and I'm telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half. 
BOOMER (V.O.) Absolutely, Al. The Redskins are playing like there's no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn't! 
DAN (V.O.) I gotta agree with you on this one. The surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this half. I mean, they look totally intimidated. 
AL (V.O.) I love when you guys agree. 
ON SHANE 
He's in the shotgun calling signals. 
SHANE Hut!   Hut!

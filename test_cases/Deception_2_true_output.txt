Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of every strange face. 
INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work. 
EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     -- No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar, wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it - RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING... He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat. 
A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.) Are you free tonight?... Hello? He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off. 
INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT 
People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange faces passing through turnstiles. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR 
A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti. Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable. We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains. 
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM 
Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing around, still feeling watched - When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: It's "S." Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks; he can't believe he's seeing her again... . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run. Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform. 
JONATHAN wait! Wait, right there! Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her. He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train, and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him capable of: he jumps onto the tracks! He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails, eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he races for 
THE CENTER DIVIDER He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up. He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane of track separating him from the platform she was standing on - only she's no longer there? He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits. 
JONATHAN 
STOP! She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing on the center divider, feet soaked in muck. Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other across the solitary track. Then: 
JONATHAN I thought you were dead! She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And all at once he's hit with a crushing realization: 
JONATHAN You are in on this, aren't you?! She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion - then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN How do you know him? (off her silence) Damn it answer me! She halts, slowly looks back at him. of camâ Through the club. He caught me trying to steal his wallet. Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed but looks like she could break down at any moment. 
âSâ He asked if I wanted to make some real money. All I had to do was get involved with you, and not ask any questions. Jonathan just stares, devastated. 
JONATHAN So everything between us - was nothing? She fights back tears. 
., S No - no... After that first night I tried to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I didn't go through with it. 
JONATHAN Go through with what? 
âC,. The plan. Get you out of the hotel room, slip out and meet up later for my money. Only I ran instead. He's been looking for me ever since. I have to leave the city - 
JONATHAN Then why didn't you? 
SÂ Because I needed to see you again. I needed to be sure you were all right. Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved          by   this. S,f I didn't know how to find you - you were just a number in a cell phone, and 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 'is"                                                             (CONT-D) Jonathan had taken that. I remembered you took this train - 
JONATHAN Wait, Jonathan? I'm Jonathan. Jonathan Messer. You're                                                           -? O.S. we hear the approaching roar of an INCOMING TRAIN... ii S                                                             7f Did you go to the police? 
JONATHAN I can't. He's framing me for murder. What? 
JONATHAN He killed a woman from the club, someone I'd been with. "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea. I/ S$f Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you understand? You need to get the hell out of here, he's going to kill you! The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER... Don't you understand? He's going to kill - - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view. Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see her through the windows.

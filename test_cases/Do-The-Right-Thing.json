It's too hot.  The kitchen is closed.\" \nMen downing six-packs of ice-cold brew. \nFaces stuck directly in front of fans. \nA young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him. \nAnd how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines. \nNew York Post: \"A SCORCHER\" New York Daily News: \"2 HOT 4 U?\" New York Newsday: \"OH BOY!  BAKED APPLE\" New York Times: \"RECORD HEATWAVE HITS CITY\" \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nCLOSE UP--JOHNNY PUMP \nPOW!  A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA. \nAhmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street. \nThis attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nThey both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk. \nANGLE--ELLA \nShe stands with caution away from the fire hydrant.  Ella does not want to get wet. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nThey're still scraping away. \nANGLE--STREET \nFolks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nBoth now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water.  The can now directs the water into giant streams. \nANGLE--ELLA \nAhmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking and screaming furiously. \nELLA Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down! I can't get wet!  I'm not playing! \n", "test1_true": "AHMAD Yo! \nELLA No! \nThey both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to the bone.  Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him. \nANGLE--STREET \nWe hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box. \nCLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM \nRadio Raheem is too cool.  By the way he's dressed, it could be fall, not the hottest day of the year.  But you could never tell it from him.  He's too cool. \nCLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM \nRaheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want to get wet either.  And if his box gets wet, somebody is gonna die.  Cee knows this too. \nANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP \nCee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so Radio Raheem can pass. \nANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM \nHe slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch.  When he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as folks play. \nANGLE--STREET \nWe hear a car horn blowing.  People move out of the way as the vehicle speeds through the spray. \nANGLE--WHITE CONVERTIBLE \nAn older man, CHARLIE, stops his white convertible and blows his horn. \nCHARLIE I'm not playing.  There's gonna be trouble if you fuck around. \nCLOSE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nPUNCHY Go 'head.  You got it.  You got it. \nCLOSE--CHARLIE \nCHARLIE This is an expensive car. \nCLOSE--CEE \nCEE You won't get wet. \nANGLE--HYDRANT \nBoth Punchy and Cee sit in front of the hydrant once again, blocking the water. \nANGLE--WHITE CONVERTIBLE \nThe car cautiously eases forward.  Charlie doesn't trust Cee and Punchy at all. \nCLOSE--CHARLIE \nCHARLIE I'm warning you. \nCLOSE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nPUNCHY C'mon. \nCEE Hurry up.  We ain't got all day. \nANGLE--STREET \nThe people all move to the car, for they know what is about to happen. \nANGLE--HYDRANT \nCee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast that flies directly into Charlie's car.

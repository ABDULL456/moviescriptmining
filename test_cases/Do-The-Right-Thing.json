YA-DIG SHO-NUFF BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY WGA #45816 \n\"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now.\" \n--THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X \nTITLES--WHITE ON BLACK \nPLACE Brooklyn, New York \nCUT TO: \nTIME Present \nCUT TO: \nWEATHER Hot as shit! \nCUT TO: \nINT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY \nEXTREME CLOSE UP \nWE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips. \nMISTER SE\u00d1OR LOVE DADDY Waaaake up!

Your voice of choice.  The world's only twelve-hour strongman, here on WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on your dial, but the first in ya hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth! \nThe CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window. The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following, right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the storefront window. \nMISTER SE\u00d1OR LOVE DADDY Here I am.  Am I here?  Y'know it. It ya know.  This is Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, doing the nasty to ya ears, ya ears to the nasty.

He flings them off his wet body. \nDA MAYOR Damn, it's hot. \nINT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY \nCAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa bed. \nCLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS \nWE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the \"dead presidents\"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks into his sister's bedroom. \nINT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY \nCLOSE UP--JADE \nJADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he continues.  Jade wakes up--mad. \nJADE Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping? \nMOOKIE Wake up! \nMookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the door closes. \nPINO Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you? \nMOOKIE Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito. \nSAL How ya doin', Mookie? \nVITO Whaddup? \nMOOKIE Just coolin'. \nPINO You're still late. \nSAL Pino, relax, will ya. \nPINO Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping. \nMOOKIE Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow. \nVITO That's right. \nPINO Shaddup, Vito. \nMOOKIE Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for. \nPINO You get paid to do what we say. \nMOOKIE What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say nuthin'. \nPino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this; all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito. \nPINO Who's working for who? \nThere's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters. \nSAL Come on in, Mayor. \nDA MAYOR Good morning, gentlemens.  It's gonna be a scorcher today, that's for sure.  Need any work done around here? \nSal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom. \nDA MAYOR It will be the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of Health. \nDa Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle. \nPINO Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum-- \nMOOKIE Da Mayor ain't no bum. \nPINO Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son. \nMOOKIE Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit. \nSAL Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business. \nVITO Tell 'em, Pop. \nPINO Me and you are gonna have a talk. \nVITO Sez who? \nPINO Sez me. \nSAL Hey!  What did I say? \nMOOKIE Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit. \nSAL Mookie, no cursing in the store. \nMOOKIE Talk to your son. \nEXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY \nDa Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle. \nKOREAN CLERK You buy 'nother beer. \nDA MAYOR Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're asking a lot to make a man change his beer, that's asking a lot, Doctor. \nEXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY \nDa Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops and takes a long swig. \nMOTHER SISTER You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya about drinking in front of my stoop? Move on, you're blocking my view. \nDa Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her. \nMOTHER SISTER You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me. \nDa Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look. \nMOTHER SISTER The evil eye doesn't work on me. \nDA MAYOR Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you? \nMOTHER SISTER You're a drunk fool. \nDA MAYOR Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you. \nMOTHER SISTER Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love. \nDA MAYOR One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil. \nDa Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a final swig of beer just for her. \nINT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY \nAn elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes the door on her mother's ranting and raving. \nANGLE--TINA \nTina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks to her son while walking around the room. \nTINA Hector, I shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later.  Ya father ain't no real father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world.  Your father is to the curb.  You're smart.  I see that look on ya face. You're saying if he's such a bum why am I with him?  Good question. Like I said before, you're no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole.  He's a mistake, but you are not. \nTina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another teenage parent. \nEXT: STREET CORNER--DAY \nEvery day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall, a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment, nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a bottle is going round and they're feeling \"nice,\" they get philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in folding chairs up against a wall in the shade. \nML The way I see it, if this hot weather continues, it will surely melt the polar caps and the whole wide world--the parts that ain't water already--will be flooded. \nCOCONUT SID You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that? \nML Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat? \nML Don't worry about it. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts. \nML I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE So when is all this ice suppose to melt? \nINT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY \nCustomers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy. Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN' OUT, a b-boy. \nSAL You paying now or on layaway? \nBuggin' Out looks at the slice. \nBUGGIN' OUT How much? \nSAL You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty. \nBUGGIN' OUT Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker. \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nMookie walks down the block with pizza box in hand when he sees Da Mayor sitting on his stoop. \nDA MAYOR Mookie. \nMOOKIE Gotta go. \nDA MAYOR C'mere, Doctor. \nMookie turns around and goes back. \nDA MAYOR Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'. \nMOOKIE OK.  OK. \nDA MAYOR Doctor, always try to do the right thing. \nMOOKIE That's it? \nDA MAYOR That's it. \nMOOKIE I got it. \nINT: TENEMENT BUILDING--DAY \nMookie is hiking up a flight of stairs. \nANGLE--STAIRCASE \nHe puts the pizza box down and takes a breather. \nCLOSE UP--MOOKIE \nSweat drips off his face. \nANGLE--MOOKIE \nHe bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last few flights. \nCLOSE UP--DOORBELL \nMookie pushes the buzzer. \nANGLE--DOOR \nA young Puerto Rican woman opens the door. \nNILDA I hope it's not cold. \nMookie hands her the pizza. \nMOOKIE No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars for the pie. \nNilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but Mookie's foot says, \"Hell no.\" \nMOOKIE Hold it.  Let me count this first. \nFirst he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills. \nMOOKIE You're short. \nNILDA I counted the twelve dollars myself. \nMOOKIE Twelve is right, but no tip. \nNILDA No tip. \nMOOKIE Look, lady.  I carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit. The cheese didn't slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who don't care.  I do care.  May I get paid? \nNilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going anywhere. \nNILDA Wait here. \nMOOKIE I'll wait. \nMOTHER SISTER Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it. \nJADE And move to Long Island... \nMOTHER SISTER And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people. \nCLOSE UP--JADE \nJADE Whew! \nShe looks up at the white-hot sun. \nCLOSE UP--MOTHER SISTER \nShe does the same. \nX CLOSE UP--THE WHITE-HOT SUN \nHOT, HOTTER AND HOTTEST MONTAGE \nRight now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show how people are coping with the oppressive heat. \nPeople are taking cold showers. \nSticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks. \nHeads stuck in refrigerators. \nA wife tells her husband, \"Hell no, I'm not cooking.  It's too hot.  The kitchen is closed.\" \nMen downing six-packs of ice-cold brew. \nFaces stuck directly in front of fans. \nA young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him. \nAnd how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines. \nNew York Post: \"A SCORCHER\" New York Daily News: \"2 HOT 4 U?\" New York Newsday: \"OH BOY!  BAKED APPLE\" New York Times: \"RECORD HEATWAVE HITS CITY\" \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nCLOSE UP--JOHNNY PUMP \nPOW!  A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA. \nAhmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street. \nThis attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nThey both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk. \nANGLE--ELLA \nShe stands with caution away from the fire hydrant.  Ella does not want to get wet. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nThey're still scraping away. \nANGLE--STREET \nFolks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play. \nANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY \nBoth now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water.  The can now directs the water into giant streams. \nANGLE--ELLA \nAhmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking and screaming furiously. \nELLA Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down! I can't get wet!  I'm not playing! \nCharlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out, and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl Lewis. \nANGLE--STREET \nCharlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the folks; none is to be bought. \nCHARLIE I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever catch those fucks they'll be sorry. Cocksucking sonabitches! \nThe ranting continues, and people laugh at him. \nCHARLIE You people make me sick. \nA cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two officers, LONG and PONTE, get out. \nCHARLIE Officers, I want an arrest made. Now. \nOFFICER PONTE What happened? \nCHARLIE Two Black kids soaked me and my car. It's fucking ruined. \nOFFICER LONG Where are they? \nCHARLIE Where are they?  What kind of fucking asshole question is that? They ran the fuck away. \nOFFICER PONTE Do you wish to file a complaint? \nCHARLIE A complaint.  I want those fucks locked under the jail. \nOfficer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench. \nANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP \nOfficer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on. \nOFFICER PONTE This hydrant better not come back on or there's gonna be hell to pay. \nCHARLIE What about my car?  I want justice. \nOfficer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on. \nOFFICER LONG You know anything about this? \nDa Mayor is quiet. \nCHARLIE He knows.  He's a witness.  They all know.  He saw the whole thing. \nOfficer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side. \nOFFICER LONG Who were the punks? \nDA MAYOR Those who'll tell don't know. Those who know won't tell. \nOFFICER PONTE A wise guy. \nMookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from the interrogation. \nMOOKIE Let's go, Mayor. \nOFFICER LONG Keep this hydrant off.  You want to swim, go to Coney Island. \nCHARLIE He's leaving?  What about me? \nOFFICER PONTE I suggest you get in your car quick, before these people start to strip it clean. \nThe man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans around him and he considers what he just heard. \nOFFICER LONG Let's go, break it up.  Go back to your jobs. \nOFFICER PONTE What jobs? \nBoth cops laugh. \nANGLE--STREET \nCharlie drives away, fuming. \nVITO I'll do that. \nMOOKIE We're outta here. \nMISTER SE\u00d1OR LOVE DADDY Thanks for stopping by.  WE LOVE Radio, 108 FM. \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nOn a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking cerveza fr\u00edo, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music. \nANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM \nAs usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level. \nANGLE--STOOP \nThe Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the stoop and goes to the car. \nANGLE--CAR \nStevie turns the car radio off. \nCLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM \nRadio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king. \nSTEVIE You got it, bro. \nANGLE--STOOP \nThe men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on. \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nVito and Mookie see Buggin' Out on their way back to Sal's. \nMOOKIE You the man. \nBUGGIN' OUT You the man. \nMOOKIE No, you the man. \nBUGGIN' OUT No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world. \nBuggin' Out gives Mookie five and a menacing look at Vito. \nMOOKIE Vito is down. \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nBuggin' Out is walking down the block when CLIFTON, a yuppie, accidentally bumps into him, stepping on his new sneakers. \nCLOSE--BUGGIN' OUT \nHe looks at his sneakers. \nCLOSE--SNEAKERS \nThere is a big black smudge on his new white unlaced Air Jordans. \nANGLE--BUGGIN' OUT \nHe runs down the block after Clifton. \nBUGGIN' OUT Yo! \nClifton turns around. \nBUGGIN' OUT Yo! \nCLIFTON Yes? \nBUGGIN' OUT You almost knocked me down.  The word is \"excuse me.\" \nCLIFTON Excuse me.  I'm very sorry. \nVito stands frozen in front of his brother. \nPINO Are you gonna listen to this Mook? Listen to him tell you to smack me? Your only brother? \nVito walks away and Mookie is disgusted. \nPINO I didn't think so. \nEXT: STREET--DAY \nOfficers Ponte and Long drive down the block and at the corner they stop, glare at the Corner Men. \nCLOSE--OFFICER PONTE \nCLOSE--SWEET DICK WILLIE \nCLOSE--OFFICER LONG \nCLOSE--COCONUT SID \nANGLE--POLICE CAR \nOFFICER PONTE What a waste. \nANGLE--CORNER \nSweet Dick, ML, and Coconut Sid stare right back at the cops. \nANGLE--POLICE CAR \nIt drives off. \nANGLE--CORNER \nCOCONUT SID As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest. \nML What was you saying? \nCoconut Sid blanks. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE Motherfucker wasn't saying shit. \nML Look at that. \nCOCONUT SID Look at what? \nML points across the street to the Korean fruit and vegetable stand. \nML It's a fucking shame. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE What is? \nML Sweet Dick Willie. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE That's my name. \nML Do I have to spell it out? \nCOCONUT SID Make it plain. \nML OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down. \nSWEET DICK WILLIE Let it be broke. \nML Can ya dig it? \nSWEET DICK WILLIE It's dug. \nCLOSE--ML \nML Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place. \nCLOSE--COCONUT SID \nCOCONUT SID It's been about a year. \nPUNCHY Shut up. \nDA MAYOR Go on now.  Leave me be. \nAHMAD You walk up and down this block like you own it. \nCEE Da Mayor. \nPUNCHY You're old. \nAHMAD A old drunk bum. \nDa Mayor stands up from his seat cushion on the stoop. \nAHMAD What do you have to say? \nDA MAYOR What do you know 'bout me?  Y'all can't even pee straight.  What do you know?  Until you have stood in the doorway and heard the hunger of your five children, unable to do a damn thing about it, you don't know shit.  You don't know my pain, you don't know me.  Don't call me a bum, don't call me a drunk, you don't know me, and it's disrespectful.  I know your parents raised you better. \nThe teenagers look at Da Mayor. \nELLA He told you off. \nDa Mayor sits back down on his seat cushion on his stoop. \nINT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY \nANGLE--PAY PHONE ON WALL \nMookie is on the phone. \nMOOKIE I know I haven't seen you in four days.

Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me. \nJADE I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work. \nMOOKIE Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me. \nJADE I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is. \nMOOKIE Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid. \nJADE Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities. \nMOOKIE What responsibilities? \nJADE I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about. \nINT: BATHROOM--DAY \nMookie turns on the shower and screams; the water is ice cold. \nEXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY \nMother Sister sits in her window looking out at the block. \nEXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--DAY \nDa Mayor has fallen asleep sitting on his stoop.  His hands loosely hold a brown paper bag that is tightly twisted around a beer can. \nEXT: CORNER--DAY \nSweet Dick, ML, and Coconut Sid each hold an umbrella for protection from the hot and harsh rays. \nEXT: FIRE ESCAPE--DAY \nAhmad, Punchy, Cee, and Ella sit on a fire escape, trying to keep still, trying to find a cool spot in the shade.  No one says a word. \nINT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY \nSal takes a seat at one of the tables. \nSAL I'm beat. \nPino sits down next to his father. \nPINO Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive. \nSAL Since when do you know what's best for us? \nPINO Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood? \nSAL Too many pizzerias already there. \nPINO Then we could try something else. \nDA MAYOR Doctor, there's nothing to cry about.  You're OK. \nA woman in her twenties, LOUISE, Eddie's mother, breaks through the crowd and hugs her baby. \nLOUISE What's wrong? \nEDDIE Mayor knocked me down. \nLOUISE You should be ashamed of yourself. \nDA MAYOR Ma'am, the boy is just scared to death.  What actually happened is that I was minding my business when I saw your son about to be run over. I ran into the street to save him and I had to knock him down to keep the both of us from getting hit. \nThe crowd agrees \"That's the way it happened,\" and Louise stands up. \nLOUISE Eddie, is that the truth? \nEddie is quiet. \nLOUISE Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you? \nEddie is still mum. \nLOUISE I'm talkin' to you, boy. \nDA MAYOR Miss, the boy is fine. \nWHAP!  Louise hits Eddie on da butt.  Eddie starts to dance, as his mother hits hard; she's heavy-handed. \nLOUISE What I tell you 'bout lying? \nWHOP! \nLOUISE What did I tell you 'bout playing in the street? \nWHAP! \nEDDIE Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. \nWHOP! \nLOUISE Get upstairs now. \nEddie runs away. \nLOUISE And when your father comes home, he's gonna wear ya little narrow behind out too. \nDA MAYOR You didn't have to hit your son; he's scared to death as it was. \nLOUISE I appreciate ya helping my Eddie. I truly do, but I'll have nobody question how I raise him, not even his Daddy. \nDA MAYOR You're right. \nLouise goes away, probably to give her son another \"whooping.\"  Da Mayor tips his hat to her. \nINT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DUSK \nSal sits at a table talking to Jade as she finishes her \"special\" slice. \nJADE Sal, that was delicious. \nSAL Anytime. \nVito, Pino, and Mookie look on, watching Sal have the time of his life. \nJADE Thanks. \nJade gets up and Mookie helps her. \nMOOKIE I'll see you out. \nJADE See ya around. \nSAL Don't wait too long to come back. \nEXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DUSK \nCLOSE--MOTHER SISTER \nMOTHER SISTER That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life. \nCLOSE--DA MAYOR \nDA MAYOR I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.

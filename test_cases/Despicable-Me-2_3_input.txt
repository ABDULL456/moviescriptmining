They begin walking away together, then Margo is reminded of her sisters when Edith loudly clears her throat. 
MARGO (CONT'D) Um...I'll catch up with you guys later. Bye! 
She turns and runs after Antonio. 
EDITH Can I be the first to say...Ewwww! 
Agnes grabs Edith and shakes her. 
AGNES We gotta go tell Gru! 
EXT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - DAY 
Gru approaches Eagle Hair Club. 
GRU All right, I'm going in. 
LUCY (IN HEADPHONES) If it picks up any traces of the serum the sensor in your belt buckle-- 
Gru activates the high-tech scanning device on his belt buckle. 
INT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME 
Lucy is in the cupcake shop monitoring the scanning device results. She can hear him and see from his POV. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   52. 
LUCY --will make a sound like this-- MEE- MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! 
GRU (annoyed) Okay! I get it!     I get it! 
INT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - SAME 
Gru fumbles with the automatic door, then enters Eagle Hair Club. 
FLOYD (O.S.) (chuckles) Welcome to Eagle Hair Club. 
At the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle spins around. Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking sinister and petting a FURRY OBJECT that looks like a cat. 
FLOYD (CONT'D) It's about time you showed up...Mr. Gru. 
His pet BALD EAGLE perched next to him SQUAWKS. 
GRU You...know my name? 
FLOYD (chuckles) When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged, I make it my business to know all about them. You are bald. And that is bad. 
He strokes the furry object. Kisses it.    Then places it on a MANNEQUIN HEAD. It's a TOUPEE. 
FLOYD (CONT'D) There you go, my sweet. 
INT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME 
Lucy monitors the chem-tracking device from inside the shop. 
LUCY I'm getting nothing so far. I think you need to move around. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      53.

Gru listens in on the headphones. 
He steps over to a wall on which hangs a PAINTING of Floyd flying with eagles. 
GRU Wow, this looks interesting.     What is it? 
Gru thrusts his hips at the painting.    Floyd watches him, suspicious. 
FLOYD I take it you're an art lover? 
LUCY (IN HEADPHONES) No serum. 
GRU Yeah, not so much. 
He walks over to a podium with a TROPHY.     He thrusts his hips at that, too. 
GRU (CONT'D) Oh, how about this impressive trinket? 
FLOYD I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.

{"train": "With a neatly tended garden. It is the last house on a street of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond it the street disappears down a bluff. The empty space beyond suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of the river. \nMrs. Munson is entering by the gate. She stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers. \nI/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY \nMrs. Munson lets herself in. A cat lopes up to her, the bell around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg. \nMRS. MUNSON You need somethin' to eat, Angel? \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nMrs. Munson hand-cranks a can opener around a tin of cat food. \nMRS. MUNSON Mm... gizzards... \nThe cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover comes off the can. \nThe can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nAbove the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache starting to gray. A couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine. \nMrs. Munson enters and lights the candles. \nMRS. MUNSON Othar, I went'n complained about WeeMack, I hope it'll do some good. That boy hangin' by a thread! Over the pit! Fiery pit! \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\"! \nShe shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting. As she sits she gives an audible groan. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Sixty-seven years of life, forty- six years of marriage, you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles? It's the human condition, most humans anyway. Like that ball player said: world's got two kinds of folks -- them that's got piles and them that's gonna get 'em. But you was always healthy as an ox... \nThere is the distant moan of a riverboat horn. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Passed on before you got piles. Mmmmhmm. Thank the Lord you wasn't sick. You don't wanna sicken 'n die. No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful... go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land... woof... \nA gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the portrait flicker. As Mrs. Munson looks around the room, vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the cat arches its back and hisses. \nAt this moment the doorbell rings. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Well who's that now, Pickles? \nShe grunts as she hoists herself out of the chair. \nI/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT \nShe opens the door-- \nA draft-- \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe candles below the portrait of Othar go out, sending up thin wisps of smoke. \nI/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT \nThe cat shrieks and bolts out the door, past the man on the stoop: GOLDTHWAIT HIGGINSON DORR, III. \nHe is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat and a cape over a cream-colored suit. He has dark circles under his eyes. The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, is wiped away by: \nMRS. MUNSON PICKLES! \nDORR Ma'am? \nMRS. MUNSON Go get 'im! \nDORR I do beg your pardon? \nMRS. MUNSON Go get Pickles, I didn't let 'im out! \nDORR (tasting the name) Pickles... \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nDorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady. \nMRS. MUNSON Oh, he's up the tree again. Your gonna have to shimmy on up. \nDORR I am so terribly sorry, madam. But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative? \nMRS. MUNSON Huh? No, he won't come down less you fetch him. He'd set there til Gabriel blows his horn if someone didn't shimmy up. Up with you now! \nDORR Well then couldn't we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements, or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in Hong Kong but now produced in the other so-called \"Little Tigers\"... \nHis fingers form the quotes. \nDORR ...of the Pacific Rim? The point bein', do we have to actually ascend the tree-- \nMRS. MUNSON Look, I don't want no doubletalk. If you ain't gonna fetch him down I guess I gotta call the po-lice... \nDORR Police... \nDORR Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music. \nMRS. MUNSON Gospel music? \nDORR Well-inspired by the gospels, certainly. The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo. \nMRS. MUNSON Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be okay. \nDORR But I certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you. May I enquire -- do you have a root cellar? \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nDorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order to avoid an overhead beam. He is followed by Mrs. Munson. \nDORR Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising... \nHe pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead. \nMRS. MUNSON Little dank, ain't it? \nDORR Oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics... \nHe experimentally claps his hands. \nDORR ...Marvelous. These earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt. That's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will do nicely... \nHe dry-washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains mournful. \nDORR ...This is perfect. This is more than perfect. I can scarcely contain my glee. \nMRS. MUNSON You containing it okay. \nHe starts to peel cash out of a large, well-worn billfold: \nDORR Allow me to pay you a week in advance. Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance. Allow me to pay you a month in advance. I cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi. \nMRS. MUNSON That would be a shame. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nTRACKING ON A GARBAGE CART \nOn the cart is a boombox. It is playing \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.\" \nIt is being pushed through a casino empty of customers. \nAs the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it: \nVOICE (V.O.) You gotta peel this shit out sticks to the bottom. \nWIDER \nshows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of custodians. Emptying the wastebasket is WEEMACK-MACKATEE FUNTHES. He is instructing GAWAIN MACSAM. \nWEEMACK ...You wouldn't believe this shit, sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gonna find sanitary napkin shit stuck there, Tucks, I don't know what the fuck people do while they're gambling here man. \nGAWAIN I ain't peelin' funky shit with my human hands, man. That's a prescription for disease and viruses and shit, attackin' y'insides. \nAs they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is on something less than the scale of a Las Vegas casino. The floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their shoulders. Other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, preparing to work. \nWEEMACK You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks everything. Man is a motherfuck. Shit -- looka this. \nAfter a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next wastebasket and slips it in his pocket. \nWEEMACK ...You keep an eye out, man. I found a hundred-dollar chip once. \nGAWAIN Fuck that, man. I ain't pawin' through used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip. \nWEEMACK I said it was a hundred. \nGAWAIN Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n leak outcha fuckin' asshole. \nSERVICE HALL \nThe cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor. \nWEEMACK This tunnel leads back onto land. To the office for all the people work for Mannex. Mannex Corporation. Owns the Lady Luck 'n three other boats... \nINT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY \nThe two men are entering a windowless fluorescent-lit office area. A row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door. \nWEEMACK ...This is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them. \nHe stops to empty a wastebasket. \nWEEMACK ...The lights is ugly but it ain't as many Tucks. \nHe bangs on the steel door: \nWEEMACK ...YO, motherfuck! Lemme in! \nDIRECTOR What the hell is this? \nPancake's manner is professorial: \nPANCAKE World War I vintage gas mask. It's authentic. Strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off. The animal is free to be as active as he wants, doesn't inhibit his movement, and I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing-- \nDIRECTOR It looks like a fucking joke. \nPancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort: \nPANCAKE ...Nnnnrnff! \nThe director squints at him: \nDIRECTOR What? \nPancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was: \nPANCAKE No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely right, the gas mask is a whimsical concept-- \nDIRECTOR How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Kennel Rations? \nThe dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. Its breathing is growing louder. \nPANCAKE Well, you're absolutely right\u0096- \nDIRECTOR Don't let the client see this. \nPANCAKE Of course not, that would be inappropriate-- \nDIRECTOR Or the Humane fucker. \nPANCAKE No no-- \nThe dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, breathing ever more loudly. \nDIRECTOR They'll shut the fucking spot down, Pancake. Put the goddamn canteen back on. That says he's a soldier. Dented tin canteen. Just tie the damn thing to his collar. \nThe dog flops over into the mud. \nPANCAKE Easiest thing in the world. I just thought -- but the canteen is much better. Good concept. Let's go with that-- \nDIRECTOR What's he doing? \nThe dog has started to convulse. \nPANCAKE Well, he's uh... Just breathe normally, Otto. \nDIRECTOR The fucking dog can't breathe. \nPANCAKE Oh, he can breathe, that thing is -- just breathe normally, Otto. \nThe dog's breath is rasping and horrible. \nDIRECTOR The fucking dog cannot breathe! Get that fucking thing off him! \nPANCAKE Of course. Easiest thing in the world. \nHe stoops and fiddles at the straps. \nPANCAKE ...It's on good and tight, I, uh... Just breathe normally, Otto. \nHe starts thumping at his pockets. \nDIRECTOR Get the fucking thing off him! \nPANCAKE Don't have my Leatherman. Mountain! Give me your Leatherman! Chop chop! \nDIRECTOR Get the fucking thing off him! Chitra, make sure the Humane fucker doesn't come over here! Bring him to craft services! \nAs he makes to scoop up the dog: \nPANCAKE Good idea! Ice water, treats-\u0096 \nDIRECTOR Not the dog, you idiot! The Humane fucker! Distract him! \nPANCAKE Right! Of course! \nHe goes back to work on the mask. \nDIRECTOR Oh my god, he's bleeding! \nPANCAKE No, that's me -- I -- the Leatherman... here we go. \nHis hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas mask off. \nA crowd is starting to gather and gape. The director barks at a grip: \nDIRECTOR Put up a couple solids here -- I don't want the client seeing this! \nPancake thumps on the inert dog's chest. \nIt bounces off our mouth guard and flies up. \nHUDSON (O.S.) ...shit... \nWe are looking forward just as \nCRUNCH! \nWe are hit by the defender. \nWe once again land face-up. \nVery steeply FORESHORTENED, right over us, we see the defender juggling the live ball. \nWith a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high, distant defender. \nHe finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and starts back upfield. \nWe climb wearily to our feet. We look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone. He pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us, then resumes his strut. \nShouting from the sidelines brings our PANNING attention over. \nThe coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and using his clipboard to wave us off the field. \nWe trot toward the sidelines. \nAll of our teammates stare at us \u0096- some in shock, some in anger, some in pity. \nAt the sideline bench our POV swings round as we seat ourself. A hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet and we \nMATCH CUT TO: \nOur first OBJECTIVE SHOT as the player (HUDSON) finishes pulling off his helmet. He is a big blond boy. His entire body, including his face, is solidly built. \nAn offscreen Voice: \nCOACH (O.S.) Hudson! \nThe boy, Hudson, turns to look, and we cut to one last \nPOV \nThe COACH is striding up, swinging his clipboard at the camera: with a loud CRUNCH! it brings on: \nBLACK \nEXT. MINI-MALL / HI-HO DONUT - DAY \nHIGH ANGLE \nIt is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven- Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut. The Hi-Ho Donut sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much smaller lettering: And Croissants. \nA beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. Both front doors open. Two BLACK KIDS get out and look around with a manner that is if anything too casual. \nINT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY \nThere is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. Glass cases display donuts identified as GLAZED, JELLY, and FANCIES. Fancies ooze yellow goo. The jelly on the jelly donuts is developing a crust of age. The glazed also look moth-eaten. \nOne customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. Next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes. \nBehind the counter is a middle-aged VIETNAMESE WOMAN in a neat white blouse. \nThe two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from underneath their windbreakers. \nYOUTH #1 All right Dragon Lady, give us all the fuckin' money! \nThe woman stares blankly. \nYOUTH #1 We want that donut money! \nVIETNAMESE WOMAN Yao gin nyap! \nA man appears from the kitchen in back. He is a middle-aged Vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. An ascot is knotted at his neck. He wears aviator eyeglasses. In his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette. This, we shall learn later, is THE GENERAL. \nYOUTH #2 Okay papa-san, we want that donut money. \nYOUTH #1 And we ain't fuckin' around, Mr. Hi- Ho. \nVIETNAMESE WOMAN Hi-Ho. \nThe two youths look at her briefly. Nothing else is forthcoming. \nThe drunk looks up from his paper bag. \nYOUTH #2 Look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't complicated. You give us all the fuckin money, you don't get shot in the head, you make more donuts, get more money. That's how it works, see? \nThe General stares at him. As with his wife, none of it seems to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed. \nYOUTH #1 Give us the money! \nHe is pointing the gun directly at the General's head. \n\"Yes it is!\" \nPREACHER ...To smite is to reMIND! We got to STOP that decline! And scramble back UP to the face a the almighty Gyod! \n\"Amen!\" \nPREACHER ...'Stead a worshippin' that GOLDEN calf, that earthly TRASH on that GARBAGE island! That GARBAGE island in that shadowland WAY outside the Kingdom a God! \n\"Way outside!\" \nPREACHER ...That GARBAGE island where scavenger birds feast on the bones a the backslidin' damned! \n\"Yes they do!\" \nPREACHER ...And so, let us pray... \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nIt is a white clapboard country church. The preacher stands at the door chatting with the congregants filing out. \nWOMAN #1 You preach a wonderful sermon, Brother Cleothus. \nPREACHER Why thank you, Sister Rose. \nMRS. MUNSON That man has a lot to say. \nWOMAN #1 Yes he does. \nMRS. MUNSON And every word of it the truth. \nWOMAN #2 Mm-mm. Jesus well pleased with him. \nWOMAN #3 Deed he is. \nPREACHER Oh now ladies... \nWOMAN #3 Pleased as he can be. \nWOMAN #1 Mm-mm. \nMRS. MUNSON Stout, too. \nWOMAN #1 Mm-mm. \nPREACHER Oh now you gracious ladies. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nMrs. Munson is at the kitchen table. She folds a five dollar bill into a sheet of paper, raising her voice as she does so: \nMRS. MUNSON It was a good sermon. That man has a lot to say. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWe have CUT to the portrait of Othar over the mantel. He does not answer. \nFrom the kitchen: \nMRS. MUNSON'S VOICE (O.S.) ...Stout, too. It would've been a comfort to you... \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nMrs. Munson has stuffed the paper-enclosed bill into an envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to Bob Jones University. \nMRS. MUNSON And the choir was all in good voice. Mm-mm- \nThere is a knock at the door. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Who could that-- \nThe cat yowls and hisses. \nI/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY \nAs Mrs. Munson swings open the door. \nG.H. Dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry-washing his hands and obsequiously ducking his head. \nDORR My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice-- \nMRS. MUNSON Somebody die? \nDORR I beg your-- Oh! \nHe looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him. \nDORR ...No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization... \nHe turns and gestures at the vehicle. \nAt his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's side. \nDORR And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent? \nGawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick. \nGAWAIN ...Offices. Underground. \nDorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his lips. He murmurs: \nDORR Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain... \nHe has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall. \nDORR ...This earth. \nHe crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles. \nDORR ...Any questions? \nLump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand. \nDORR ...Yes, Lump? \nLUMP What, uh... what does \"cosseted\" mean? \nOnce again Dorr's smile fades. He does not dignify the question with answer. \nDORR The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation. \nThe General acknowledges with a curt nod. \nDORR ...Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require. \nClark acknowledges verbally: \nPANCAKE Happy to be on board. \nDORR Gawain is the proverbial \"inside man\". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion. \nGAWAIN Ya damn skippy. \nDORR And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome. \nLUMP Thanks, Professor. \nDORR Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. Let us make beautiful music together. And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar. \nLUMP There's no \"I\" in \"team\". \nAll stare at him. \nDORR ...Lump has a very excellent point. \nThe music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the Red Army choir. We \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT \nThe men at work, tunneling. \nThe cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the hole now opened in the wall. \nLump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, wields a pickaxe at the forward point. \nAt the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain. \nG.H. Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses perched midway down his nose. \nThe General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly pressed leisure suit and ascot. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLater, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking around the empty parlor. He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth. \nOver the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch the men as they cross to the front door. \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe men load the earth into the hearse. \nEXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT \nWe are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted. \nThe hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and dimming its lights. The men emerge; when they open the back of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to watch from a distance. \nWe watch the men from HIGH, ANGLED DOWN along the masonry of a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground. \nThe garbage scow is approaching. We hear the low toot of its horn as it nears the bridge. \nLump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, leaning over the railing. \nDORR Oh, I am indeed-- \nMRS. MUNSON Cut it himself and burned the holes. Israelites called it a kalil. \nDORR Ah. \nMRS. MUNSON Kalil, fife, same thing. You can read about it in the Bible. Ain't nothin' new under the sun. \nDORR Indeed not. \nMRS. MUNSON Gone these twenty years. He was some kind of man. \nFrom Othar's POV, slightly high, we see them both twist in their chairs to look up at the portrait. \nREVERSE of the portrait, LOW ANGLE. Othar looks down at us with what appears to be bemusement. \nMarva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless beat. At length, Marva Munson sighs: \nMRS. MUNSON ...Blowed the kalil. \nDorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires: \nDORR ...I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar? \nPrompted by her silence, he adds: \nDORR ...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews? \nMRS. MUNSON I don't know nothin' 'bout that. Othar didn't study no shofar, to the extent a my knowledge. The kalil was good enough for my Othar... \nShe gazes at the portrait. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Some kind of man. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nTRACKING BEHIND A SASHAYING ASS \nfollowing a woman in a red dress. \nGAWAIN (O.S.) Hey baby, don't be cruel. Jus' sneak one little peek... \nThe woman looks back over her shoulder, smiling, as she continues to walk. \nGAWAIN ...Don't let this uniform fool ya-- \nREVERSE PULLING TRACK \nleads Gawain MacSam, pushing his wheeled trash bin. \nGAWAIN You don't need to be gamblin', honey, you lookin' at a sure thing. They call me Mr. 21, baby, 'cause that's how I measure up. I am the original black Jack, honey, accept no substitutions. You can pull my lever all day long, sweet mama, I ain't never gonna come up lemons. That's right, sugar, you can blow on my dice any ol' time. \nINT. CASINO - GUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nGudge has his feet up on the desk and is filing his nails with an emery board. \nGAWAIN But Mr. Gudge, she had an ass that could pull a bus. This lady was fine, fine, dandy, divine. \nGUDGE I don't care how big her ass was, MacSam. You're fired. \nGAWAIN Say what? \nGUDGE There is no fraternizing with customers on the Lady Luck. Clean out your locker. \nGAWAIN But Gudge\u0096- \nGUDGE Get out of here. You're fired. \nGAWAIN You can't fire me. I sue your ass! \nGUDGE Sue me? For what? \nGAWAIN Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages, man! \nGUDGE Punitive damages. \nGAWAIN Ya damn skippy. I know you firin' my ass 'cause I'm black! \nGUDGE Everyone on the custodial staff is black, MacSam. Your replacement's gonna be black. His replacement will no doubt be black. \nGAWAIN Fuckin' judge is gonna be black, motherfucker, that's who gonna be black! You gonna stand tall before the man! \nEXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY \nVERY HIGH ANGLE \nWe are looking down past the distinctive pylon-mounted yellow letters: WAFFLE. \nINT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY \nThe band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee. Dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string tie. His manner is more mournful even than usual: \nPANCAKE You son of a bitch punk! Shut your goddamn mouth! \nHe shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him. \nGawain draws a gun. \nGAWAIN Come and get me motherfuck! Come on, baby, let's get it on! \nMountain starts screaming. \nPeople look, aghast. \nDORR Gentlemen, please! \nThe other men pry Pancake and Gawain apart. \nDORR ...Gentlemen, this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house! \nPancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his clothes. \nPANCAKE ...Nobody talks to Mountain Girl that way. She had an abusive family! \nGAWAIN Fuck you, man. \nPANCAKE Little punk. I got syrup on my safari jacket. \nHe embraces Mountain, who continues to sob quietly. \nDORR Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman, Mountain Water, to be-- \nPANCAKE Mountain Girl. \nDORR I am so very sorry. I propose that we consider this matter to be closed, and we shall chose to trust her, since we now have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr. Pancake's portion of the booty. \nOver the shoulder of the quietly weeping Mountain Girl: \nPANCAKE Of course. Wouldn't have it any other way. \nGAWAIN Damn right you won't. \nPANCAKE Up yours, punk. \nDORR Gentlemen! And the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled. That leaves only the question of Gawain retrieving his job. \nLUMP Couldn't you just bribe the guy? \nAll turn to look at Lump. \nINT. MUNSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nOthar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece. Marva Munson knits; G.H. Dorr sits nodding over an ancient volume of half-forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway down his nose. Curtains waft lazily in the summer night breeze. \nMRS. MUNSON ...You just a readin' fool, ain't you Mr. Dorr. \nDORR Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that often I feel more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world. To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called \"dead tongues\" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper. \nMRS. MUNSON Mm-mm. \nDORR In these books... \nHe removes his glasses and lazily twirls them. \nDORR ...In these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long. \nMRS. MUNSON Wisdom of mankind, what about the wisdom of the Lord? \nDORR Oh yes, the Good Book, mm. I have found reward in its pages. But for me there are other good books as well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity, freighted with the insights of Man's glorious age. And then of course I love, love, love the works of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe. \nMRS. MUNSON I know who he is. Kinda creepy. \nDORR Oh no, madam, noooo. Not of this world, true; he lived in a dream, an ancient dream... \nDorr himself is lost in a dream: \nDORR \"Helen, they beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks a yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... \" \nMRS. MUNSON Who was Helen? She wasn't a loose woman, was she? Some kinda whore a Babylon? \nDorr is still lost: \nDORR One doesn't know who Helen was, though I picture her as bein' very, very extremely... pale. \nHe comes to himself, focuses on Mrs. Munson. \nDORR ...Miz Munson, I was tryin' to think of some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in... \nHe chuckles. \nDORR ...this weary, wayworn wanderer... \nThe Professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it had served as bookmark, and hands it across. \nSHERIFF ...be gettin' back... \nBACK TO NORMAL PERSPECTIVE \nMrs. Munson is about to go out the door but notices something: \nA corner of the Professor's cape, protruding from under the end of the bed. \nMRS. MUNSON What the... \nBACK TO DORR \nfearfully watching. \nHIS POV \nThe heavy orthopedic shoes approach, and then, with loud Mr. Mogul sounds of effort, Mrs. Munson's hands and knees hit the floor. \nHer head drops in to view to peer in, her own cheek against the floorboards. \nMRS. MUNSON ...What the... Why, Professor! \nWe see the Sheriff watching and his HIGH POV of Mrs. Munson's enormous ass. \nMRS. MUNSON ...What you doin' havin' tea down there?! \nDorr makes silent hand waves to disavow his own presence. \nMrs. Munson roars with laughter. \nWith difficulty she pushes herself back upright, still laughing. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Land of Goshen! Get out from under there! \nSHERIFF Miz Munson, my pager just went off... \nMRS. MUNSON Why of all the... \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT \nThe Sheriff is already backing down the stairs: \nSHERIFF 'Fraid I gotta respond... \nHe opens the front door and calls up: \nSHERIFF ...I'll try to meet your friend some other time. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - DORR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDorr shimmies out from under the bed. \nDORR Well that was very... refreshing... As you know... \nHe gets to his feet, slaps dust from the front of his pants. \nDORR ...we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves into confined spaces. At Yale the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth; Harvard, a broom closet. \nMRS. MUNSON Why I never! \nDORR There was the goldfish-swallowin' craze, of course, a different but related phenomenon... Ahem... I hope I didn't spill any tea... \nINT. CASINO - GUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON A BOX OF CHOCOLATES \nThe box is being pulled open. \nGUDGE (O.S.) What the hell is this? \nWIDER \nshows Gawain in Mr. Gudge's office as Gudge, behind the desk, looks at the gift-wrapped box. \nGAWAIN It's just my way of sayin', well, goddamnit, I don't know what it's like walkin' in your shoes, bein' all tightass and all, and you don't know what it's like to walk in my shoes, but, well... \nGudge is opening a card that was inside the box. Its floral front says in gold script, \"I'm Sorry... If I hurt your feelings... \" \nGAWAIN ...You know, there's the custodian, and then there's the man inside the custodian, y'understand what I'm sayin'... \nGudge opens the card. Inside is a hundred-dollar bill. \nGAWAIN ...and that man has needs, dig, and I guess those needs, Mr. Gudge, which they usually involve women with big asses, well those motherfuckin' needs sometimes well up over the custodian like the motherfuckin' Johnstown Flood. But my point is it ain't gonna happen again. Not if it's humanly possible... \nGudge reads the card, flips it over to look at its back. \nGUDGE Hmm... \nGAWAIN But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on that girl, Mr. Gudge, you'd a wanted her sitting on your face too. \nGUDGE Well, we're all human. \nGAWAIN He's the motherfuckin' piece of igneous. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe Professor emerges from the cellar. Mrs. Munson awaits with her friend who is likewise togged out in fancy Sunday dress and carrying a shiny black purse. \nMRS. MUNSON Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes, Rosalie, Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.D. \nROSALIE Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters. \nDORR Well of course in my youth I was simply known as Goldthwait... \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nPancake is taking the boom box off the table to clear some space. \nPANCAKE All right, safety meeting, let's listen up. General, could you hand me the prima cord and the compound there. Before we set the charge we'll run through our procedure. \nVarious paraphernalia are laid out on the table. \nThe cat sits in a corner of the cellar, watching carefully and, it seems, listening attentively. \nPANCAKE ...I have earplugs for whoever wants them. Just wedge them in your ears. Now here we have -- not yet, Lump. \nLump stops putting in his earplugs. \nPANCAKE ...Now. Prima cord. Gelatinite. C4. Time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C4 and insert two leads. A... \nHe holds up one lead. \nPANCAKE ...and B. \nHe holds up the other lead. \nPANCAKE ...Charge comes from a battery that is inside this plunger. Ordinary auto battery, you can pick it up at Sears, easiest thing in the world... \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nA black town car idles at the curb. Dorr is just escorting the two ladies out the front door and down the stoop. \nDORR I remember my father telling me -- and it is one of the few memories I retain of the man, from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it -- he said, \"Goldthwait, you are not formed as other little boys.\" \nROSALIE Mm-mm. \nMRS. MUNSON He a man of learnin'? \nDORR G.H. number two was self-educated; he had no career, as such, though the state recognized the breadth of his readin' by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nPancake sets down the two electrical leads and picks up a hammer. \nPANCAKE This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar. \nHe looks pointedly at Gawain. \nPANCAKE ...This is for your own protection, so pay close attention. Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them. That means me, or the General. Separately they are harmless-completely inert. Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a hammer-- \nHe swings the hammer down onto the plastique-- \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \n--and there is the dull thud of an explosion and the house's windows rattle in their frames. \nThe Professor, at the open door of the car into which the two ladies have just sat, looks up at the house, as do the ladies. \nMRS. MUNSON ...What in the name of heaven was that? \nDorr stares at the house, appalled. \nDORR I'm... quite sure... that there is... no cause for alarm... \nHe struggles for self-possession. \nDORR ...Why, I'm not even absolutely certain that I heard anything at all. \nMRS. MUNSON Didn't hear anything?! \nDORR Well, something, perhaps, but... \nMarva Munson starts to get out of the car. \nDORR ...nothing that need discompose us, was the sense I was trying to convey... \nHe urges her back into her seat. \nDORR ...Miz Munson, I will not have you missing your musical recital. Why, you go ahead now. Miz Funthes, you as well, I beg of you... \nHe is backing up the walk. \nDORR ...I shall call the gas company, or the water company, or whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this little... occurrence... I shall see to the matter... as only a highly educated classicist could. \nTree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. We hear the hiss of the cat. \nThe men are bundling Pancake into the hearse. Dorr calls to the women before climbing in: \nDORR The house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for Mr. Pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt. \nThe cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road. \nMRS. MUNSON You let the cat out! \nThe General leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues the animal down the road. We hear the retreating padding footsteps of all six feet. \nDORR The General is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet. Please go, go and enjoy your concert, and we shall see you later in the evening. Au revoir, mes dames! \nEXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT \nA new day. The garbage scow chugs down the mighty Mississippi. It toots its horn. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON SCHEMATIC MAP \nIt shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel. It is now almost to the vault. \nA violin bow enters to tap at the line. \nDORR (O.S.) Despite our little setback we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault... \nThe bow taps at the vault outline. \nDORR ...here, this afternoon, having successfully blasted that little ol' rock to pieces during Miz Munson's choir practice. \nThe violin bow withdraws. \nDORR ...Clark, perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin'. \nA bandaged hand enters frame and a finger-stump points at the end of the penciled line. \nPANCAKE (O.S.) Of course. Why, it's child's play now, easiest thing in the world. Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault... \nWIDER \nThe men are clustered around the map, spread out on the sackbutt case in the cellar. Clark continues: \nPANCAKE ...Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through. \nDORR And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity? \nPANCAKE Oh, I should think so, it's only one finger. Inhibits me in doing finer work, of course. I'll always have to live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and I'm just thinking out loud here, maybe since, as you say, it will present problems later... \nDORR Yes, Clark? \nPANCAKE Well, maybe -- and this is something I've talked over with Mountain Girl, and she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion -- maybe I should get a little extra compensation for the accident. \nA long, stony silence. \nPANCAKE ...Somewhat larger share. Why, if this were any other line of work I'd be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't I? Might even have a pretty good lawsuit. \nGAWAIN You gonna sue yaself for blowin' off your finger? \nPANCAKE Well that is simply asinine-- \nDORR Yes but you see, Clark, this is not what you just called \"some other line of work.\" \nPANCAKE But if it were-- \nDORR This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor. Governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits. \nLUMP Yeah, but he lost his finger. \nGAWAIN We don't give a shit! Man can blow his own dick off, don't make no nevermind to us! We don't gotta pay the man for goin' around blowin' off body parts! Getcha head outcha ass, man! \nPANCAKE Look, you-- \nDORR I think that in this instance Gawain has a very excellent point. I-- \nGENERAL No extra share! \nAll stop and stare at the General. \nClark grumbles: \nPANCAKE Well, okay, majority rules, like I say, it was just a trial balloon. Hand's not so bad really, I even get some phantom feeling. \nGAWAIN You pull on your prick you get phantom feeling. Greedy motherfuck. \nDORR Now that that matter is settled, let us synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work. In... twenty seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen exactly... fifteen... \nPANCAKE It will be twelve-fifteen? \nDORR No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven seconds -- it will be twelve- sixteen... eight... \nClark's voice is still hoarse. He does small knee bends of urgency: \nPANCAKE No choice! Quickly! It's a medical condition! \nGAWAIN You are disgusting, man. All right, follow me. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nWe are CLOSE ON Gawain peering anxiously to one side. \nHe turns and peers the other way. \nWe hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, Clark emerges from the men's room door next to which Gawain stands. His manner is now completely relaxed. \nPANCAKE Feel thirty pounds lighter. \nThey start walking back to the vault. \nPANCAKE ...Thank you for being so understanding. Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of IBS is educating the public. Afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it. And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race. \nGAWAIN Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know about it. \nPANCAKE That's the kind of attitude we're fighting. \nGAWAIN Well maybe you should sign me up, man, 'cause you startin' to irritate my bowel. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nThe choir finishes a number and sits -- all except for Marva Munson, who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her neck, slips it off and, with murmured goodbyes, slips away. \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nAs the two men enter Clark is still holding forth: \nPANCAKE ...I guess I never told you, that's how Mountain Girl and I met. They had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's, in the Catskills. Of course the tourist business up there has suffered, with the demise of the Borscht Belt. So they have different promotions, mixers, so on. This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories. \nGAWAIN Man, I don't wanna hear a single one a them stories. \nPANCAKE Well, some of them are very-- \nGAWAIN Not one fuckin' story! You one fucked- up motherfucker! You-- \nThey stop short, looking: \nThe General and Lump are standing in the middle of the floor, stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at the same corner of the ceiling. \nLump turns to Clark and Gawain. \nLUMP Hey, lookit that. \nGawain and Clark join them in the middle of the vault and look up at the corner of the ceiling. \nA small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men. \nTHROUGH THE CAMERA \nBlack-and-white video, very WIDE ANGLE HIGH SHOT, of the four motionless men below goggling up at the lens. Smoke plumes from the General's cigarette. \nBACK TO NORMAL PERSPECTIVE \nPANCAKE Huh. Looks like an Ikegami. \nHe slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a shelf just below the camera and hoists himself. He peers in at the lens. \nTHROUGH THE LENS \nClark looming into EXTREME CLOSE SHOT. \nPANCAKE ...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure whether it's broadcasting... \nNORMAL PERSPECTIVE \nPANCAKE ...Um-hm... No... \nHe is fingering the back of the camera. \nPANCAKE ...Hard wire... \nDown below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam of wall and ceiling. At the opposite corner it travels down the joint of the two walls. \nHe traces its path down and then across one wall at chair- rail height towards the door. The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it. \nJust before reaching the vault door the wire goes through the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. Gawain goes out the vault door... \nINT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY \n...and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then continues along the floor. Gawain follows it and the other men continue to follow him. \nHe traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope. The other men scuttle behind into... \nINT. CASINO - MONITOR ROOM - DAY \nPANCAKE Of course. I understand. \nDORR The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying. It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact: I remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names. \nPANCAKE She certainly does. \nDORR Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable conclusion -- someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nPancake, hunched over, scurries along the tunnel. He reaches the remnants of a large rock, where the tunnel grows smaller. \nHe drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward, toolbelt clanking along. \nWe are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly bassy \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.\" \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nThe music loudly present at the cut. Gawain takes a handheld blowdryer out of his satchel and flips it on, directing it at the fresh paint on the wall whose repairs are now invisible. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nMusic once again muffled. Pancake has reached a little LED- displaying timer with leads trailing off of it. \nHe grabs it, puts on his reading glasses, squints. \nThe display shows: TIME REMAINING: 00:12. \nThe colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number does not advance. For some reason, stuck. \nPANCAKE Huh. \nHe reaches to his tool belt, pulls out his Leatherman. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Munson is setting places at a large table. There are about a dozen place settings. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nPancake now has a mini-mag light clenched between his teeth, aimed down at the timer. He opens the phillips head on his Leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space. \nPANCAKE Nnnnrungh... \nHe is squinting with pain. \nThe muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede. \nINT. VAULT - DAY \nGawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door. The vault is completely empty but looks completely undisturbed. \nHe closes the heavy vault door behind him, leaving quiet. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nQuiet here as well, now. Pancake's moan trails off to nothing. He relaxes. The moment, whatever it was, has passed. \nHe looks back down at the unit, flicks it with his finger, and it emits a soft beep. \nPANCAKE ...Huh? \nHe squints at the back of the unit. \nAs it beeps again, he turns the unit over to look at its face. \nThe readout now says: 00:10. \nAs he watches, peering down through the bottom of his glasses, it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by: \nPANCAKE ...What the-- \nHis eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit. It continues beeping. He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle back up the tunnel, whimpering. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nGawain is wheeling his garbage cart past Elron. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Munson is placing the last piece of silverware, just so. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nPancake is in full panicked awkward flight as-- \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY \n--BOOM! We CUT TO the cellar and Pancake is shot out the tunnel like a human cannonball, trailing a comet-tail of dirt, dust, and debris that wafts what were neatly stacked bills up into the air. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMRS. MUNSON Well that's prob'ly true... \nThe Professor, warming, has resumed dry-washing his hands: \nDORR Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. As long, that is, as the secret stays with us. And I, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it. \nMrs. Munson nods, musing. \nMRS. MUNSON Well... it's hard to see the harm in it... One penny... \nHer gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm her face. The smile freezes, though, as her look catches on something. \nHer POV: Othar, above the mantle, looks down with a disapproving scowl. \nMRS. MUNSON ...I'm sorry, Professor. \nDorr is taken aback: \nDORR Excuse me, ma'am? \nMRS. MUNSON No. It's wrong. Don't you be leadin' me into temptation. \nDORR Madam, I must strenuously protest-- \nMRS. MUNSON No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'. I know your intentions were good, and I won't call the police if you give the money back. But I gotta see that you do it. \nDORR Madam-- \nMRS. MUNSON And all a you gotta go to church with me next Sunday. \nThe Professor is incredulous: \nDORR And... engage in divine worship? \nMRS. MUNSON I made up my mind. You can double- talk all you want, but its church or the county jail. \nDORR But-- \nShe rises. \nMRS. MUNSON You think it over. I gotta feed the cat. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nThe men all sit around the card table, lit from below by an oil lamp. The General is neatly packing the stacks of banknotes into the sackbutt case. \nGAWAIN Motherfuck! \nDORR Yes. Unfortunately, Mrs. Munson has rather complicated the situation-- \nGAWAIN I know how to discomplicate it! Put a cap in the old lady's head! Then everything simple again! \nThe group lapses into silence, considering. Even Gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed. \nThe Professor is solemn: \nDORR ...Not easy to do. Many reasons. Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town. Reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood. No, Gawain; would that it were simple! \nGAWAIN Well -- fuck, man! What we gonna do, give the money back and go to church?! \nDORR I shudder. I quake. \nHe turns to the General. \nDORR ...You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there not a middle way? \nThe General grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt case full of money: \nGENERAL Must float like a leaf on the river of life. And kill old lady. \nThe men murmur. \nDORR Well... I suppose you are right. It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand. \nHe looks around. \nDORR ...We have the cellar. We have masonry and trowel. Perhaps we could simply... immure her. \nPANCAKE Sure, easiest thing in the world. I could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, Mountain has a source for the manacles... \nDORR Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... No, I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. No... no... shortest and most painless is best. Let us confront reality. Gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. The only question is... who wields the weapon. \nHe looks around the table. Silence. No volunteers. \nDORR ...I believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws. \nPANCAKE Well, sure, fair enough. \nHe takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and snaps a handful of its bristles. \nPANCAKE ...I'm thinking, though, that since I lost my finger -- I mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat -- maybe I should be excused from this thing. Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway-- \nDorr looks back to Mrs. Munson. \nDORR ...and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed. \nEXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nWe are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking blankly down at the doings below. \nIn the misty night Lump and the General are braced over the railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that protrude from the Hefty bag cinched around Gawain's ankles. A cigarette burns on the General's lower lip. Behind the two men we can see the idling hearse. \nThere is the toot of the garbage scow. Lump and the General release Gawain's feet. \nTheir POV shows the sack receding and flumping into the garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below. \nA flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts off the scow with angry caws. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDorr skulks at a corner of the living room's picture window, peering out at the street. \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nDOOR'S POV \nThe Volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street in the same direction as previously; apparently it has been circling. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe Professor scowls. \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nDORR'S POV \nThe hearse pulls up to the curb. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nThe Professor clomps down the cellar stairs. Pancake is loading their digging implements into a satchel. \nPANCAKE They back yet? \nDorr is absent: \nDORR Yes... yes, they just arrived. \nPancake straightens from the satchel. \nPANCAKE Good. I'll go dump these in the hearse. \nHe mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand. We can hear the front door opening as the other men enter. \nDorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances slowly to the sackbutt case. \nHe slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up. \nHe lifts the lid. \nMother Jones magazine. Piles of Mother Jones magazines. \nDORR What in heaven's name... \nHe riffles a pile, confirming that it is in fact all magazine, no money. \nLump and the General are clomping down the stairs. \nDORR ...General! \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe are PULLING Clark down the street, a satchel in either hand. \nHIS POV \nThe microbus, parked halfway down the block, ominously idling. \nTHE BUS \nWe are CLOSE on its side-view mirror. Someone leans from the driver's seat for a view into the mirror, and in the mirror we see her, pigtails swinging: Mountain Girl. \nHER POV \nClark Pancake, still rather small, approaching up the empty street. \nPANCAKE \nPULLING him again. A smile is beginning to play at the corners of his mouth. \nPANCAKE No extra share, huh... \nThe smile abruptly fades. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMrs. Munson's snore catches on an inhale. She mutters something, sighs, and resumes snoring. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nThe General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway leading to the second floor. He slides one hand into his jacket, pulls out a garotte. \nWith the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop and snags the other handle with his other hand. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe General emerges from the staircase and advances on the closed bedroom door. As he reaches for the knob he performs the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe door swings noiselessly open. The General pauses to survey: \nThe still room. The ticking clock. Mrs. Munson, a large sleeping mound upon the bed. \nThe General advances, raising the garotte in both hands. \nHe closes on her sleeping form. \nThe garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck. \nIt is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away... \nSomewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of-- \nThe clock, striking one. It is a cuckoo clock but, instead of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration. \nThe General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening. \nJesus retreats back into the clock. \nThe General has swallowed his cigarette. \nHe reaches up to his throat, panicked. In a silent frenzy, he yanks loose his ascot. \nHe gazes wildly about. \nHe reaches for the water glass at Mrs. Munson's bedside. \nHe tips it back into his mouth. There is a rattling sound. \nHIS POV \nThe uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers and lowers -- rattling toward his face. \nTHE GENERAL \nHe frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass back down. Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat. \nA mad but silent dash for the door. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nPlunging for the head of the stairs-- \n--a brief yowl from the cat-- \n--recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss and a flash of its claws at the General's leg-- \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n--and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing his body like a rag doll's. \nAt the bottom of the stairs he lies still. \nA CLOSE-UP shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, unblinking eyes staring. Traces of smoke wisp from each nostril and his open mouth. \nOver the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare. He looks somewhat smug. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nThe Professor and Lump, responding to the noise, look slowly up toward the ceiling. \nEXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail. \nThe Professor stands looking at it, contemplatively. \nLump stands looking at it, contemplatively. \nThe cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, impassively. \nThe professor muses: \nDORR ...T'was our at\u00e9 brought us to this pass... \nwe look down on the Professor, the black bird rising to perch on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground. \nThe bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry. \nBACK TO THE PROFESSOR \nlooking at the receding red light on the bridge of the receding scow: \nDORR \"...The agate lamp within thy hand... \nBACK HIGH \nThe teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless bird flaps off. \nBACK TO THE PROFESSOR \nvery dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time and space: \nDORR ...Ah, Psyche! from the regions which Are Holy land!\" \nThis is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring a direct hit on his head. He falls over the rail. \nHis cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains. \nThe fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear. His body drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way. \nFinally the body rips free. It falls away from us. As it does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second- banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding scow. \nDorr's body lands neatly on the barge. \nA gust of wind. \nThe cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away amidst the cawing birds. \nThe cat, watching, blinks. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nDRINKING GLASS \nIt is resting on the very edge of the night table -- protruding, in fact, past the table's edge. \nIt is morning. We hear rustling from the bed. \nHands reach INTO FRAME and hesitate, finding the glass empty of water and precariously perched. \nMRS. MUNSON (O.S.) Hmm. \nThe hands tip the glass and take the teeth. We hear complicated oral noises. \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY \nThe door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the stoop. Mrs. Munson leans INTO FRAME to pick it up and we ADJUST as she straightens to have a look: \nThe headline says: $2.6 MILLION DISAPPEARS FROM LADY LUCK CASINO. The subhead: POLICE BAFFLED. \nMRS. MUNSON Mm-hm. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY \nMrs. Munson is walking down the stairs. \nMRS. MUNSON Professor! \nShe stops midway down and looks: \nThe empty cellar. \nMoney stacked neatly on the card table. \nMrs. Munson sadly shakes her head. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Hmm. Couldn't face the music. \nEXT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY \nMrs. Munson is climbing the porch in her Sunday best. She feints at the dog who lies curled in the sun: \nMRS. MUNSON Scoot now! Outa the way! \nINT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY \nThe sheriff is busy on the phone; there is a DEPUTY today also on the phone. The sheriff, seeing Mrs. Munson enter, covers the phone with one hand. \nSHERIFF WYNER Miz Munson. \nMRS. MUNSON Sheriff, I gotta make a statement. \nSHERIFF WYNER Could it possibly wait, ma'am? We're a little busy today. \nMRS. MUNSON I guess it can wait, but it's about that casino money. \n", "test1_input": "\"THE LADYKILLERS\" \nScreenplay by \nJoel Coen and Ethan Coen \nBased on the 1955 movie \n\"The Ladykillers\" \nby William Rose \nEXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY \nA BOAT \nSpecifically, a garbage scow. \nWe see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty Mississippi. \nHead credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, except for an incongruously heroic score. \nThe COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film rather than a feature. \nOne piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is obviously library. And not a new library either. \nThe garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC. \nThe head credits end as the anthemic music resolves. \nEXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nAN OLD HOUND DOG \nlies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front porch. The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze fan them in and out of audibility. \nWe once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep. \nWe DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the \nSAUCIER WORM STORE \nYour source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera... \nWe TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the \nSAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING. \nA campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a thumbs-up: \nRE-ELECT WAYNE WYNER SHERIFF/He Is Too Old to Go to Work. \nINT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY \nWe hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound. \nWe are DRIFTING toward the door of the lock-up, which stands open. The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made. \nA KEY \nWe are ARCING slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that hangs from a nail. The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring continues. \nThe TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall. \nPOLICE SCANNER \nWe DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss. \nThe snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop. \nThey belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward. \nAs the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring of a telephone -- muffled, not present. \nIt nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his phone. \nSHERIFF WYNER Sheriff Wyner... \nThe muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, at the phone. Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door: \nVOICE (O.S.) Worms. \nThe sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open. \nThe sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear. \nHe manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile: \nSHERIFF WYNER Afternoon, Miz Munson. \nEntering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress and fruited bonnet. \n", "test1_true": "SHERIFF WYNER ...Mackatee Funthes? \nMRS. MUNSON No no, WeeMack! Mackatee's eldest! \nSHERIFF WYNER Oh yeah, believe I do. \nMRS.

MUNSON And Othar don't like that music neither! \nSheriff Wyner now displays an exaggerated solicitousness: \nSHERIFF WYNER It's been disturbin' Othar then, has it? \nMRS. MUNSON How could it help but do! That kind of music! You know what they call colored folks in them songs? Have you got any idea? \nSHERIFF WYNER I don't think I-- \nMRS. MUNSON NIGGAZ!

MUNSON Well God bless ya. Don't wanna be tried and found wantin'. \nSHERIFF WYNER No ma'am. \nMRS. MUNSON Many many tunkalow parzen, Sheriff Wyner. Many many tunkalow parzen! \nSHERIFF WYNER Many what ma'am? \nMRS. MUNSON You have been tried and found wanting. Don't want that writin' on the wall! \nSHERIFF WYNER No ma'am-- \nMRS.

SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY \nMrs. Munson closes the door behind her. She wags a paper fan and mutters: \nMRS. MUNSON He's a good man. Just needs instruction.

MUNSON HOUSE - DAY \n", "test1_id": 234, "test2_input": "The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an ingratiating smile. \nDORR Hsst... Madam... \nThe chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. His smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward Mrs. Munson. \nDORR ...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a word... \nMRS. MUNSON You get back down those stairs! \nDORR I assure you I shall be-- \nMRS. MUNSON Hush! Down those stairs! We havin' tea now! I be down shortly. \nHe nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut. \nThe ladies look inquisitively at Mrs. Munson as his footsteps are heard descending the stair. \nMRS. MUNSON ...He's the tenant. \nLADIES Mm-hm. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR DAY \nAs the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. The money has been picked up and is once again in stacks upon the table. \nDORR She shall be down shortly... \nExplaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head: \nDORR ...Tea. Dainties. \nThe men nod, murmuring. \nThe cellar door squeaks open. There is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair. \nUsing only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs. Munson his usual deadpan look. \nShe halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron and holding a spatula. \nMRS. MUNSON I don't know what you boys been up to but I wasn't born yesterday and I know mischief when I see it. Now I want an explanation, but first I want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments. I been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play. \nShe turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently returns. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Hmph. \nShe turns again and clomps back up the stairs. \nThe General opens his mouth and, again without using his hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip. \nLump is fretful: \nLUMP Professor? \nDORR Yes, Lump? \nLUMP I can't really play the buttsack. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe cellar door opens and the men troop out, G.H. Dorr leading and the other men following rather sheepishly behind. \nDORR Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg. \nLADIES Mm-hmm. \nMRS. MUNSON Hmph. \nDORR Perhaps I could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital. Though I don't pretend to great oratorical skills, I will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe. \nLump, Pancake, and the General sit and awkwardly accept dainty teacups. \nThe Professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces: \nDORR ...\"Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore...\" \nCLOSE-UPS of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man in the cape. \nDORR \"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... \" \nMurmuring Voice: \nVOICE Amen. \nA slurp of tea from another quarter. \nDorr bears on: \nDORR \"On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome... \" \nA long silence. \n", "test2_true": "VOICES Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah. \nA lady holding a teacup turns to the General: \nLADY That was soooome poem. \nThe General stares at her. \nLADY ...You know any? \nWe hear the front door opening and Gawain enters, still wearing his Lady Luck custodial uniform. He looks. \nHis POV: church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated among them, also holding teacups and scones. \nGAWAIN Y'all been celebratin'?. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - LATER (EVENING) \nThe bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; Mrs. Munson is seeing them off at the door. Evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow. \nThe men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, wave off the departing ladies. \nDORR Goodbye, ladies. We had such a pleasant time. \nMrs. Munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens. \nMRS. MUNSON Now, I wanna know what's goin' on. \nDORR Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. Though in this instance, I believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern. \nMRS. MUNSON Hmph. \nDORR You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas -- I myself became acutely aware of the smell of \"rotten eggs\" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette. \nThe General stiffly bows: \nGENERAL So sorry. \nThe Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, continues to look at Mrs. Munson, though his story, apparently, has ended. \nShe returns his ingratiating look with a stare. \nMRS. MUNSON ...What about all that money? \nDorr's smile fades. \nDORR ...Ah. The money. The money is... Mr. Pancake's. \nPANCAKE That's right. \nDORR He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion. \nUnder her stare, he elaborates: \nDORR ...Steel Sack. \nPANCAKE Don't trust the banks. Never have. \nShe thinks, decides. \nMRS. MUNSON This don't smell right. I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner. \nA chorus of gasps. \nDORR Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It was a lie! A fantastic tale! You have us! Dead to rights! But please allow me to tell you the truth -- in private. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nHe escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of Othar, sits across from her, and leans confidentially in. \nDORR Madam... \nHe agonizes. The words do not come easy. \nDORR ...What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear. \nMRS. MUNSON Mm-hm. \nDORR We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure! \nMRS. MUNSON Lord have mercy! \nDORR It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth. \nMRS. MUNSON Stolen money! \nDORR Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim. \nMRS. MUNSON ...Just one penny? \nDORR Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims! \n", "test2_id": 235, "test3_input": "MAMA Daddy gonna kick your ass! \nWHAP! \nMAMA ...Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog! \nWHAP!

WHAP! Gawain is sobbing: \nCHILD GAWAIN Please don't hurt me, Mama! \nNow it is the adult Gawain blubbering. \nThe clack of knitting needles stops and Mrs. Munson turns to look. \nMRS.

MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT \nGawain is tramping down the stairs. \nGAWAIN I can't do it! \nThe men are stunned. \nDORR Why... this is most... irregular. \nGAWAIN She reminds me of my mama. I can't shoot my mama! You motherfuckers just draw straws again. \nPANCAKE Wait a minute. You've got to accept your responsibilities, young man. \nGAWAIN Fuck you. And your irritated bowel. I can't shoot that old lady. \nGENERAL Must shoot! \nPANCAKE Now look here, it's the easiest thing in the world. Pretend her head is a casaba melon, and the gun is a melon- baller, and-- \nGAWAIN What the fuck you talkin' about, man? You think this a melon-baller, you do it, man! \nDORR My my, this is most irregular. \nPANCAKE Look, with equal rights come equal responsibilities-- \nDORR I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right, my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job. \nGENERAL Must shoot! \nGawain shoves the gun toward Pancake. \nGAWAIN She just an old colored lady to you -- you do it, man! \nPANCAKE Why you sniveling little coward! \nGAWAIN What you say, you whiney motherfucker? I come up your irritated ass with this -- motherfuckin' gun-- \nHe is waving the gun. \nPANCAKE You think you scare me, you mewling punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me! \nHe shoves Gawain. \nPANCAKE ...Be a man! \nGAWAIN You fuck! \nHe shoves him back. \nPancake shoves: \nPANCAKE Be a man! \nGAWAIN You ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a sixty-year-old lady in pigtails! \nPANCAKE WHY YOU BASTARD PUNK! MOUNTAIN GIRL IS FIFTY-THREE! \n", "test3_true": "PANCAKE ...SHE COULD RIDE YOUR ASS TO JELLY! \nHe lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle. \nDORR Gentlemen, please! \nGAWAIN I seen Virginia hams I'd rather stick my dick in than your old-- \nBANG! A muffled gunshot. \nQuiet. \nThe two men have stopped rolling. \nThey stare at each other where they lie, Pancake on top. \nAt length: \nPANCAKE ...Oh my god... \nHorrified, he slowly rises. \nPANCAKE ...I think he's hit! \nThe men gather round and look down. \nGawain still stares up at the ceiling. \nPancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes. No reaction. \nPANCAKE ...I'll just check the carotid artery. \nHe checks the carotid artery. \nPANCAKE ...That's a negative. \nLUMP Oh, fuck. \nDORR Oh my. \nLUMP Is he dead, Professor? \nPANCAKE Sure he's dead. I checked his carotid artery. \nDORR Well this is most irregular. We will need a Hefty bag. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nTHE CELLAR DOOR \nCreaking open. The Professor, Lump, and the General peek out. \nThe living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running. \nDorr hisses: \nDORR She is in the kitchen. I shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDorr enters breezily; Mrs. Munson is at the sink, filling a teapot. \nDorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, Mrs. Munson has her back to the living room. \nDORR Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have outlined your position to my colleagues and I now return to you to return our collective verdict. \nMRS. MUNSON Mm-hmm. \nBehind her, the General peers around the corner and starts a catlike advance across the living room. \nDORR There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take. Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive. \nMRS. MUNSON I don't care they was receptive or not! \nDORR And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions. To a man, I must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities. \nThe General signals to Lump who now crosses the living room with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's carry. \nMRS. MUNSON Well that is a shame. \nDORR Indeed. But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it! -- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility. Though that was the original preference of some. \nMRS. MUNSON Well I'm glad y'all came to see the light, anyway. I'm gonna have some tea and go to bed. \nThe Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it out the door, is anxious to wind things up: \nDORR So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. Enjoy your tea, madam... \nBacking out, he looks to one side. \nThrough the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb. There is another car -- an old Volkswagon microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street. \n", "test3_id": 236}

He was some kind of man. \nFrom Othar's POV, slightly high, we see them both twist in their chairs to look up at the portrait. \nREVERSE of the portrait, LOW ANGLE. Othar looks down at us with what appears to be bemusement. \nMarva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless beat. At length, Marva Munson sighs: \nMRS. MUNSON ...Blowed the kalil. \nDorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires: \nDORR ...I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar? \nPrompted by her silence, he adds: \nDORR ...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews? \nMRS. MUNSON I don't know nothin' 'bout that. Othar didn't study no shofar, to the extent a my knowledge. The kalil was good enough for my Othar... \nShe gazes at the portrait. \nMRS.

They call me Mr. 21, baby, 'cause that's how I measure up. I am the original black Jack, honey, accept no substitutions. You can pull my lever all day long, sweet mama, I ain't never gonna come up lemons. That's right, sugar, you can blow on my dice any ol' time. \nINT. CASINO - GUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nGudge has his feet up on the desk and is filing his nails with an emery board. \nGAWAIN But Mr. Gudge, she had an ass that could pull a bus. This lady was fine, fine, dandy, divine. \nGUDGE I don't care how big her ass was, MacSam. You're fired. \nGAWAIN Say what? \nGUDGE There is no fraternizing with customers on the Lady Luck. Clean out your locker. \nGAWAIN But Gudge\u0096- \nGUDGE Get out of here. You're fired. \nGAWAIN You can't fire me. I sue your ass! \nGUDGE Sue me? For what? \nGAWAIN Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages, man! \nGUDGE Punitive damages. \nGAWAIN Ya damn skippy.

WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY \nVERY HIGH ANGLE \nWe are looking down past the distinctive pylon-mounted yellow letters: WAFFLE. \nINT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY \nThe band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee. Dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string tie. His manner is more mournful even than usual: \n", "test1_true": "LUMP Yeah, it fucks things up. \nDORR I am beside myself. I am at a positive loss for words. \nGAWAIN You still talkin' okay though. \nWAITRESS Have you all decided? \nDorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon her: \nDORR Oh madam, we must have waffles. We must all have waffles forthwith! \nThey hand in their menus. \nDORR ...Oh we must think. We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability! Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment. \nGAWAIN Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! He fired me 'cause I'm black! \nPANCAKE He can't do that. You could sue him. Open and shut case. \nGAWAIN Fuckin' A. \nPANCAKE This is not 1952. \nGAWAIN Man's a fuckin' bigot. \nDORR Well then, perhaps, surely, a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope, especially if it's a premium chocolate, imported, say, from Switzerland, or the Netherlands, or some other of the so- called \"Low\" countries be they Dutch or Flemish or Walloon-- \nGAWAIN Walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna roll over for a fuckin' candy bar! \nPANCAKE I'm afraid there's a setback on the tunneling front too. We've run into a pretty large rock, and-- \nGENERAL -- Rock! \nAll turn to look at the General. He continues to stare at a spot in space. He slowly releases some inhaled cigarette smoke, murmuring: \nGENERAL ...Very bad. \nDORR Oh my my, it seems that the poet was right: Troubles never singly come. \nPANCAKE Oh, we can get through the rock, no worries there. Simplest thing in the world. Why we blow right through it; I've got a pyro license, we bore a hole in the rock, pack in a little plastique; igneous blows pretty good, and we-- \nLUMP Is he gonna want a piece of the action? \nAll turn to look at Lump. \nPANCAKE ...Who? \nLump hesitates, looking at the inquiring faces that surround him. \nLUMP ...Igneous? \nA female Voice: \nMOUNTAIN GIRL (O.S.) Hello Clark. Am I ordering the prima cord? \nThe men look up at her. \nPANCAKE Yes, Mountain, we were just talking about that, and some plastique. \nAll the men are staring at her, agog. \nGAWAIN ...The fuck is this? \nPANCAKE This is Mountain Girl. Mountain is my right hand. She helps me with ordnance. Helps me with damn near everything. \nThe men stare. \nGAWAIN ...You brought your bitch to the waffle house?! \nThere is tension in the air. Dorr clears his throat. \nDORR I confess myself to be puzzled as well. I thought we all understood that, so far as our little enterprise is concerned, mum, as the saying would have it, is the word-- \nPANCAKE Of course. I understand that. But this is Mountain... \nHe chuckles. \nPANCAKE ...I don't keep secrets from Mountain. That's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship. \nGAWAIN ...You brought your bitch to the waffle house? \nHe looks around. \nGAWAIN ...Man brings his bitch to the waffle house! \nPANCAKE Look, you, I'll thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way. She's the other half of my life. \nGAWAIN Everybody lookin' at me like I'm a fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job, and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house! \nPancake lunges across the table, sending dishes clattering to the floor as he grabs Gawain by the shirt. \n", "test1_id": 234, "test2_input": "Clark's voice is still hoarse. He does small knee bends of urgency: \nPANCAKE No choice! Quickly! It's a medical condition! \nGAWAIN You are disgusting, man. All right, follow me. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nWe are CLOSE ON Gawain peering anxiously to one side. \nHe turns and peers the other way. \nWe hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, Clark emerges from the men's room door next to which Gawain stands. His manner is now completely relaxed. \nPANCAKE Feel thirty pounds lighter. \nThey start walking back to the vault. \nPANCAKE ...Thank you for being so understanding. Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of IBS is educating the public. Afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it. And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race. \nGAWAIN Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know about it. \nPANCAKE That's the kind of attitude we're fighting. \nGAWAIN Well maybe you should sign me up, man, 'cause you startin' to irritate my bowel. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nThe choir finishes a number and sits -- all except for Marva Munson, who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her neck, slips it off and, with murmured goodbyes, slips away. \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nAs the two men enter Clark is still holding forth: \nPANCAKE ...I guess I never told you, that's how Mountain Girl and I met. They had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's, in the Catskills. Of course the tourist business up there has suffered, with the demise of the Borscht Belt. So they have different promotions, mixers, so on. This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories. \nGAWAIN Man, I don't wanna hear a single one a them stories. \nPANCAKE Well, some of them are very-- \nGAWAIN Not one fuckin' story! You one fucked- up motherfucker! You-- \nThey stop short, looking: \nThe General and Lump are standing in the middle of the floor, stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at the same corner of the ceiling. \nLump turns to Clark and Gawain. \nLUMP Hey, lookit that. \nGawain and Clark join them in the middle of the vault and look up at the corner of the ceiling. \nA small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men. \nTHROUGH THE CAMERA \nBlack-and-white video, very WIDE ANGLE HIGH SHOT, of the four motionless men below goggling up at the lens. Smoke plumes from the General's cigarette. \nBACK TO NORMAL PERSPECTIVE \nPANCAKE Huh. Looks like an Ikegami. \nHe slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a shelf just below the camera and hoists himself. He peers in at the lens. \nTHROUGH THE LENS \nClark looming into EXTREME CLOSE SHOT. \nPANCAKE ...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure whether it's broadcasting... \nNORMAL PERSPECTIVE \nPANCAKE ...Um-hm... No... \nHe is fingering the back of the camera. \nPANCAKE ...Hard wire... \nDown below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam of wall and ceiling. At the opposite corner it travels down the joint of the two walls. \nHe traces its path down and then across one wall at chair- rail height towards the door. The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it. \nJust before reaching the vault door the wire goes through the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. Gawain goes out the vault door... \nINT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY \n...and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then continues along the floor. Gawain follows it and the other men continue to follow him. \nHe traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope. The other men scuttle behind into... \nINT. CASINO - MONITOR ROOM - DAY \n", "test2_true": "It is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged in. \nInside the video recorder is a casette, which Gawain ejects. The men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it: \n\"Shevann's Schvanz\". \nThere is a pile of other videos by the monitor: \"Charlayne and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Big Dick Blaque's Big Night Out,\" \"Lemme Tell Ya 'Bout Black Chicks,\" \"Anus & Andy.\" Just next to the pile is an old bowl of Kocoa Krispies. \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nThe General climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of money, followed by Lump, likewise encumbered. Lump hands back out a satchel to Gawain, who sets it on the vault floor by the hole. From the way he handles it, it is quite heavy. Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb in: \nPANCAKE Look, I didn't choose to have IBS-- \nGAWAIN Shut the fuck up! \nLump hands Gawain a smaller, lighter satchel which he likewise sets on the floor. \nPANCAKE There's no cure, you know. Only control. Lifelong condition. Not complaining, just fact. And I did meet Mountain. \nGAWAIN Grab your bag and get in that fucking hole! \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nMrs. Munson is leaving, with singing still audible from the service that continues inside. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY \nWe are looking from inside the tunnel towards its mouth, where the Professor stoops slightly to peer in, anxiously dry-washing his hands. \nA REVERSE shows the hunched-over men scuttling along the tunnel towards us, holding large garbage sacks. \nDORR Welcome back, gentlemen, mission accomplished I see. I am so very very delighted... \nHe gives a hand down to each man as he exits the tunnel. \nDORR ...Congratulations. Congratulations. I have some cold duck on ice for the occasion. \nLUMP Maybe we could have something to drink, too. \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nGawain, left behind, is muttering to himself as he uses a trowel and other instruments from his satchel to patch up the hole at his end of the tunnel. \nGAWAIN Motherfucker can't stop talking, can't stop shitting. Motherfucker tell everyone about his motherfuckin' asshole. No one gives a shit about his asshole. Nobody interested in another man's asshole. Or his bitch's. \nEXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY \nMrs. Munson is letting herself in. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY \nThe men are sitting around the table, champagne glasses raised. On the table sits the money, stacked in orderly piles. \nDORR Gentlemen, to we few. We who have shared each other's company, each other's care, each other's joy, and who now reap the fruits of our communal effits, shoulder to shoulder, from each accordin' to his abilities so forth whatnot. We have had our little diffences along the way, it's true, but I like to think they have only made us value one another the more, each coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities, potencies, and, yes, foibles. I suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form, and we shall say, Well, with wit, and grit, and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- we, merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck, we happy few. Gentlemen -- to us! \nMEN To us! \nThey clink. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nUpstairs Mrs. Munson runs water into a teapot, humming to herself. \nINT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY \nHaving finished patching, Gawain starts painting. He turns on his boombox, and out comes the big bassy \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.\" \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY \nThe men, having drunk deep, are setting down their glasses. Pancake looks at his watch with some concern. \nPANCAKE Charge should've gone off already. \nDORR I do beg your pardon? \nPANCAKE The charge to collapse the tunnel. I set it for eight minutes. \nDorr looks at his watch. \nDORR Well that time, and more, has most certainly elapsed. \nFROM INSIDE THE TUNNEL \nLooking toward the mouth. The men stoop over and peek fearfully in. \nThey again stand upright. A silence. \nDorr clears his throat. \nDORR I need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house. It was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished. Without a trace. Spirited away, as it were, by ghosts. \n", "test2_id": 235, "test3_input": "INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMrs. Munson's snore catches on an inhale. She mutters something, sighs, and resumes snoring. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nThe General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway leading to the second floor. He slides one hand into his jacket, pulls out a garotte. \nWith the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop and snags the other handle with his other hand. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe General emerges from the staircase and advances on the closed bedroom door. As he reaches for the knob he performs the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe door swings noiselessly open. The General pauses to survey: \nThe still room. The ticking clock. Mrs. Munson, a large sleeping mound upon the bed. \nThe General advances, raising the garotte in both hands. \nHe closes on her sleeping form. \nThe garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck. \nIt is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away... \nSomewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of-- \nThe clock, striking one. It is a cuckoo clock but, instead of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration. \nThe General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening. \nJesus retreats back into the clock. \nThe General has swallowed his cigarette. \nHe reaches up to his throat, panicked. In a silent frenzy, he yanks loose his ascot. \nHe gazes wildly about. \nHe reaches for the water glass at Mrs. Munson's bedside. \nHe tips it back into his mouth. There is a rattling sound. \nHIS POV \nThe uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers and lowers -- rattling toward his face. \nTHE GENERAL \nHe frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass back down. Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat. \nA mad but silent dash for the door. \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nPlunging for the head of the stairs-- \n--a brief yowl from the cat-- \n--recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss and a flash of its claws at the General's leg-- \nINT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n--and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing his body like a rag doll's. \nAt the bottom of the stairs he lies still. \nA CLOSE-UP shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, unblinking eyes staring. Traces of smoke wisp from each nostril and his open mouth. \nOver the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare. He looks somewhat smug. \nINT.

Lump follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail. \nDORR ...Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job. \nThey let the body fall onto the scow passing below. \nDORR ...The comedy must end. \nThe Professor turns to Lump and tries to hand him Gawain's gun, but Lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it. \nLUMP ...Professor, I been doing some thinking. \nDORR Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. \nLUMP Maybe she's right! Maybe we should be going to church! \nDORR Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those would be your words. Not that I don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought. But please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise. I am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the \"brains of the operation,\" trained in fact in the arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence. \nLUMP Yeah, I know, but-- \nDORR No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the error of thinking! Now is the moment of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you must act! \nLump reluctantly takes the gun that the Professor thrusts upon him. \nLUMP I can't do it, Professor! A nice old lady like that! \nDORR Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide! Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise! \nLUMP But-- \nDORR And reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money! Your offices shall have been nugatory! \nLUMP You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna kill her?! \nDORR Of course! My hand would be forced! \nLUMP I can't let you do that, Professor!

Disturbed birds flap upward. \nThe professor muses: \nDORR \"...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand...\" \nHis gaze rises with the ascending birds. \nAmong the white gulls is one black bird.

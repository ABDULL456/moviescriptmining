CHARLIE What about a hotel? 
KATE This man requires around the clock attention. 
CHARLIE I meant for me. 
KATE Thank you, Charlie. (she kisses his forehead) I owe you one. 
CHARLIE You owe me nine. What am I supposed to do all day? 
KATE (as if having an epiphany) You could get a job! 
CHARLIE Kate, the entire point of being an artist is that I don't have to work. Who is this guy? 
KATE Well, I can't tell you much because... 
KATE AND CHARLIE I'm not allowed to discuss what goes on at the office. 
KATE Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be interesting to have someone else to talk to. It gets so quiet around here sometimes I feel like I've gone deaf. 
CHARLIE Does he have a label? 
KATE Leopold. 
CHARLIE LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his name? 
KATE He's exactly like his name. 
CHARLIE Then you owe me ten. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button ON. 
Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before an excited crowd. 
Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power OFF. 
LEOPOLD Horrible! 
He quickly scurries out the hallway. 
He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside. 
He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room. 
He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself. 
Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look. 
KATE (explaining) He's from Canada... 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly. 
LEOPOLD (finally) What is this? 
KATE It's called Hamburger Helper. 
LEOPOLD It is beyond help. Please serve the next course. 
He pushes his plate away. 
KATE I'm afraid there is no next course. If you make a list of the foods you like, I'll pick them up at the store for you. 
LEOPOLD Is all food here this... textured? 
CHARLIE Mine's good. 
LEOPOLD Please understand, I am used to a different sort of preparation. Where I come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study. A recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation. 
Charlie gives Kate a look. 
LEOPOLD Several courses are served. Menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable. 
CHARLIE In Canada? 
LEOPOLD (after a beat. Firmly) In Canada. 
CHARLIE We have a saying here. "Shake and shake the catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot'll." 
He pours catsup on his dinner.

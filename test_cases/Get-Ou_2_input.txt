INT. STARBUCKS COUNTER - MORNING 
ROSE ARMITAGE, 28 - Caucasian, brunette with freckles - cool and beautiful like an old Summer Camp crush. Rose looks at pastries through the glass. She can't help but smile. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - BATHROOM - MORNING 
Chris spreads shaving cream onto his face and shaves. He postures a little then nicks himself on the neck. He smirks; deserved that. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Chris, clothed, looks out his window through a professional camera. He flips through some striking urban images on the digital display much like the ones framed around his apartment. He is a very talented photographer. 
Sid, a small black dog, watches him. The BUZZER RINGS. 
INT. BROOKLYN BUILDING - HALLWAY. MORNING 
Chris opens the door. Rose stands outside the apartment with her hands full. She has two coffees and two bags of pastries. Chris smirks. 
ROSE I couldn't decide... 
He takes the coffee tray and pulls her inside. They kiss. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Rose and Chris have coffee and sweets by the window. The small mound of pastries sits on the coffee table. SID lays on her lap. She strokes him. It's a perfect morning. 
ROSE Poor thing. Do you even pet him? 
CHRIS Are you kidding me? When you're not here that dog gets the best fuckin' pets of his life. 
ROSE So, how come whenever I come over, he acts like he's been totally neglected. 
CHRIS `Cause he know he's got you wrapped around his little paw. 
ROSE oh, really? 
CHRIS Yeah. 
Chris picks up her foot sweetly and massages it. She melts. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - CHRIS' BEDROOM - DAY 
Chris packs a small bag of luggage. Rose lays on the bed. 
ROSE Toothbrush... Deodorant... 
CHRIS Check... Check.... 
Chris puts a cigarette in his mouth. Rose pops up and grabs the cigarette from his mouth and breaks it. Chris tries to feign incredulousness but is amused. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm not gonna have one the whole weekend. 
ROSE You quit, remember? 
CHRIS I'm nervous. 
ROSE Why? They're going to love you.

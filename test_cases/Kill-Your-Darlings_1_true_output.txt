GWENDOLYN I like it. It's the only way I meet boys. They're very strict at Barnard. 
ALLEN How strict? 
GWENDOLYN For example, they'd never let me do this. 
Gwendolyn LIFTS her sweater. Bares her brassiere. 
ALLEN Right. No. 
INT. PERMISSIONS DESK - CONTINUOUS 
Lucien peeks up from behind the desk. Sees Bill staring at him. 
BILL Go! 
Lucien races into the stacks after Allen. 
INT. STACKS - CONTINUOUS 
GWENDOLYN Did you know I've never done it with someone who was Jewish before? I really want to know what it looks like. 
Gwendolyn paws the front of Allen's pants, undoes his belt. Uncomfortable, Allen stops her. 
She pulls away, pulls down her sweater. The keys jangling in her hand. 
GWENDOLYN I'm sorry, I thought you were saying something but not saying it. Should we find your book? 
THROUGH A GAP IN THE STACKS: Allen sees Lucien, pointing to the KEYS in her grip. Realizing what he has to do. 
ALLEN There is no book. Take it off. 
GWENDOLYN Really? 
Gwendolyn sets down the keys. Undoes her cardigan. Lucien nabs the keys and races up the stacks. 
INT. ROW, LIBRARY STACKS - CONTINUOUS 
Lucien hands the keys to Bill. Bill PLACES it into a clay molding and makes an impression. 
GWENDOLYN (O.S.) No. Why don't you take it off? 
INT. STACKS, LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
Allen takes off her sweater. Gwendolyn, just in a bra. This is as close as Allen has ever come to sex. He's breathless. 
GWENDOLYN It's not like I'm a virgin. I've done it with three guys already. You're a virgin, huh? 
She KISSES him. Cold lips. He's terrified. 
GWENDOLYN You're kind of a virgin, though, huh? 
ALLEN No. 
GWENDOLYN Liar. If you have done it before, you'll last for thirty seconds. Start counting. 
She opens his fly, then lowers herself down. Allen tries to stop her, but it's too late. He sighs. 
ALLEN 
Lucien returns and see Allen reluctantly getting his first blowjob. Lucien leans against the books and watches. 
ALLEN 
Lucien flashes Allen a wicked grin. 
ALLEN 
Over Gwendolyn's head, Allen watches Lucien staring at him. He starts to get aroused. 
ALLEN 
Allen and Lucien holding eye contact, Allen thrusts into her mouth, comes. Gwendolyn rises back up, unimpressed, drops her sweater. 
GWENDOLYN I knew it. 
She grabs the KEYS that are now back on the shelf. Allen looks to find Lucien. But he is gone. 
GWENDOLYN I bet you don't even read.

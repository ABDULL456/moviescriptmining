Manzano studies the photo of Jorge. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    97. 
MANZANO Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy? 
ADJUTANT No, I checked. But right   after Sandri was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found naked, hysterical in the  street. She said it was a man fitting  Creasy's description who shot him. 
MANZANO Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very lethal human being. 
ADJUTANT You don't seem very surprised? 
Manzano looks at his Adjutant, pleased with his perception. But he isn't sharing. 
MANZANO What's surprising these days? 
An AFI agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken. Manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure. 
MANZANO Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like this. 
AGENT (laughs) Your man's here. Interrogation room two. 
CUT TO: 
SURVEILLANCE ROOM 
Seen through a two-way mirror.   Manzano watches as... 
Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor. Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly, his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as, slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing. 
Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a laugh.

INTERROGATION ROOM TWO 
Rayburn opens his eyes, looks over as Manzano enters. Still eating, he hands Rayburn a second plate of chicken. 
MANZANO Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really. 
RAYBURN (sets it down) I already ate. 
Manzano enjoys another bite, then... 
MANZANO Tell me about your friend Creasy. 
RAYBURN You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say. 
MANZANO I read the file. You and Creasy have seen quite a bit together. 
RAYBURN Two tourists who never went home. 
MANZANO You helped him get this job. 
RAYBURN That's what friends do. 
MANZANO Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. 
RAYBURN I can take care of myself. 
MANZANO You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. (laughs) You two were a married couple. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    99. 
RAYBURN The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. 
MANZANO What happened to him?   What happened to Creasy? 
Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory. 
RAYBURN None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say. 
MANZANO This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does. 
RAYBURN He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way. 
MANZANO I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that. 
RAYBURN Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead. 
MANZANO What was she to Creasy then? 
RAYBURN Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again. 
MANZANO And they took that away. 
RAYBURN A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece. 
The words sink in.   Manzano understands their magnitude. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   100. 
RAYBURN Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive across the border. So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here... 
EXT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Framed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths: 
MANZANO Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday. 
ROSANNA And left three more dead men. 
She bites the heel of his palm to keep from crying out. 
MANZANO When you talked to him, did he look sane?

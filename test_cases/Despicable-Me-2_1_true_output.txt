MARGO No one.   Just my friend Avery. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   19. 
GRU Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name? 
MARGO Does it matter? 
GRU No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless it's a boy! 
AGNES I know what makes you a boy. 
Gru turns to Agnes, concerned. 
GRU Uh...oooh...you...do? 
AGNES Your bald head. 
Gru nods, relieved. 
GRU Oh, yes... 
AGNES It's really smooth. Sometimes I stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out. Peep peep peep. 
Gru sighs and gives her a kiss. 
GRU Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older. 
Gru turns out the light and leaves the room. 
INT: LAB - DAY 
Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions in various stages of jelly making. A sign reading, JELLY TESTING AREA" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning sign. 
A SUPERVISOR MINION checks his clipboard as the MINION next to him steals a banana from his pocket. He turns, but the Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. We see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks. 
SUPERVISOR MINION Hey, oh!    Me banana! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20. 
The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs. 
A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least efficient way possible. 
A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala "I Love Lucy." 
One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes over and tells him to get back to work. 
The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed fruit. 
Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars. 
Gru enters the lab and greets the minions. 
GRU Hey, Tim, nice haircut! 
He points at Tim. 
GRU (CONT'D) Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's almost Friday. 
Gru high-fives Donnie as he approaches Dr. Nefario. 
GRU (CONT'D) So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario? 
DR.    NEFARIO I developed a    new formula which allowed me to    get every known kind of berry into    one flavor of jelly. 
Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the jar. Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile. 
GRU (faking it) That tastes good... (gags) Love the flavor of that... 
DR. NEFARIO It's horrible, isn't it? DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    21. 
GRU No! No! Oh, we're making great progress! (to the Minions) Here, try some of this. 
He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. He GAGS!   Another minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. They smash the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted. 
GRU (CONT'D) Whoa... okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good. 
Dr. Nefario hangs his head. 
DR. NEFARIO Listen, Gru. There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.

Irv and Edith dance through the lobby. 
49   THE PIERRE HOTEL CAFE                                           49 
As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet plays "I've Got Your Number". Camera circles them, putting their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH OTHER quietly as they dance close. 
50   INT. ROOM AT PIERRE HOTEL -- NIGHT                              50 
Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces -- 
He gets up, she watches him dress and leave -- 
52   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                     52 
53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) As, as far as I could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted. We even con ourselves. 
54   INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                54 
55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55 
56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56 gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his house -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth. 
57   INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        57 
Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball -- that is taped to the refrigerator. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life. 
Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes -- with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it -- 
Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was married, and he had a son. 
58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58 
DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks over his shoulder. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He had adopted her son. 
DANNY DADDY! 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was a really good dad and I respected him for that. It was a tough situation for everyone. 
Irv's face lights up. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today? 
DANNY That kid Donovan is being mean to me. 
IRVING ROSENFELD The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you. 
DANNY She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards. 
Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on. 
IRVING ROSENFELD What fire? 
DANNY Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it? [Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp. She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire. 
Irv looks concerned. 
59   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    59 
Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I put out the fire. The fire is out. 
IRVING ROSENFELD For the first time in my life I do the right thing. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh shut up -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him - 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You fell in love! Don't forget we fell madly in love! 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside -- 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I don't like going out. You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people. You know how hard that is. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I put the fire out Irving! There is no fire! Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Just stop with the whole fire thing. God it was a mistake. I'm sure a million people do that all the time. Those sun lamps are dangerous. Shouldn't even have them in the house, really. I bet that happens all the time. This was nothing. 
IRVING ROSENFELD We're not happy. Alright? 
Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying nothing. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You know that I could take Danny. You know that most of your work is illegal. And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- I'm not saying that I would, but I'm saying that I could. And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving. Women do that in divorces. Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. My mother never got divorced. My grandmother never got divorced. There are NO divorces in my family. I am not getting a divorce. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Come on. What are we doing here? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD We fight and we fuck and that's what we do. That's our thing.

Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half finished. 
The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. 
John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They ask him if he's staying for another. 
A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly-finished jumper. 
Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck. 
His eyes are fixed on hers. 
Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom. 
The guitar theme ends. 
INT. LANDING - NIGHT 
John presses his ear to the bathroom door. The sound of retching. 
The toilet flushes. John pads back to his bedroom. Through the gap in the door he sees Nadia coming out, go to her room, and shut the door. He rests his head against the door frame. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LOUNGE - DAY 
A beautiful morning. Through the patio window, John watches Nadia in the garden, sitting on the lawn reading her dictionary in the sunlight. In dungarees with her hair up, she looks very young. 
EXT. GARDEN - DAY 
He walks warily out into the sunlight. She looks up, then back to the big book in her lap. He places the tea next to her on the grass. 
JOHN Are you O.K.? 
She looks at him, then down at her tome. She speaks slowly, in a heavy accent: 
NADIA Today is bath day. 
JOHN Sorry? 
She studies her book. Looks up. 
NADIA Today is bath day. 
He shakes his head. 
JOHN Bath day? 
She nods. 
JOHN I don't understand. 
NADIA Happy bath day. 
The penny drops. 
JOHN Today? 
She frowns. John leafs through the dictionary. 
JOHN Syevodnya? 
NADIA Syevodnya 
JOHN Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. 
He puts his hand on her shoulder. 
NADIA Party. (pause) Party. Syevodnya. 
John nods, smiling.

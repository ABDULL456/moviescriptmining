pain and lets go) 
THE HOOD Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room) 
TINTIN No! 
THE HOOD Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh! 
(The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood dangling above the still active Mole. 
THE HOOD Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases one hand from the railing) Like your father did. 
ALAN I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we 
do. 
Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to a police car outside the Bank of 
London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them. 
THE HOOD See you soon, Jeff. 
PARKER (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the car) Now, that was definitely showing off. 
Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is 
grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting swimming lessons from his dad 
and Alan is watching. 
VIRGIL Hey, Scott. 
SCOTT Get him! 
LADY PENELOPE (To Jeff) What did you put in these margaritas? 
JEFF It's a Tracy secret. 
BRAINS (To Fermat) That's my boy! One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a F-f-f-D-d-d- 
Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature. 
ALAN Good job, Ferm. 
TINTIN (To Alan as she spins around) So, what do you think? 
ALAN He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin) Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, blossoming. 
TINTIN Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles at him) 
JEFF (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody. I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special 
night. We're all together because of three very special people. Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs 
Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them International Rescue pins) 
FERMAT Mr. Tracy! 
TINTIN Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly over to Parker who is tearing up)

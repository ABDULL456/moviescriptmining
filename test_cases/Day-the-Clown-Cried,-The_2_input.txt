GUARD ATTENTION ! 
The men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at attention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the army.  They are rigid and waiting to hear what's up.  The Guard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the barracks. 
GUARD All the prisoners from the other side of the camp are being moved over to this side of the camp over to this side of the camp.  Barracks "H" will make room for three additional bunks. 
He takes a few steps down the aisle... 
GUARD I want all the bunks moved down toward the far end.  Get them as close together as possible. Now! GET MOVING! 
LONG SHOT 
The men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately begin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being too overcrowded as it is... 
THE MEN (ad lib) Gotta have more room... We need more space...  Hey, watch where you're going. This is stupid! 
GUARD (yelling) YOU!  You down there at the end... get those bunks right up against the wall. 
CLOSE - HELMUT AND KELTNER 
As bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, Keltner and Helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last ones on their side.  Helmut and Adolf, who have already made their move, come up to Keltner to help him with his bunk... Helmut sees that Keltner has help so he decides to back off and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of paper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying fantasy about his ultimate release... 
WIDER SHOT - THE ENTIRE BARRACKS 
The guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish the moving job... 
GUARD Hurry it up!  Come on, get moving! 
The guard turns towards the door and motions for the SIX PRISONERS to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each pair carrying a double-tier bunk. 
Their personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung over their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the Guard motions for the two bunks to be placed next to Helmut's and one on the opposite side... next to the Stout Prisoner... NOTE:  This arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk right by the door. 
The guard motions for the Stout Prisoner and Herman to give the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks. 
GUARD Get them close. (he looks around the barracks) You're all going to be nice and cozy in here. 
STOUT PRISONER (in a loud voice) Yeah, like triplets before they are born to a mother weighing 98 pounds... 
HERMAN That's what I call cozy! 
The guard smiles, and all the men laugh... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The guard starts for the door, satisfied with the arrangements... as he gets the door open, Helmut runs over to catch him before he makes his exit... 
HELMUT (anxiously) Excuse me, sir, the papers...  Did they arrive yet? 
GUARD (annoyed) They'll have to wait! 
He exits, closing the door behind him.  Helmut, with a look of despair on his face, goes back to his bunk. 
MED. SHOT - HELMUT AND KELTNER 
HELMUT You'd think, since he was coming over here anyway, the least he could do was bring the papers with him. 
KELTNER This moving men around has undoubtedly kept him very busy... don't worry, he'll bring them. 
HELMUT I'm sure if I asked him again he'd really become annoyed with me.  Would you remind him for me, please? 
KELTNER (kindly) Of course I will. 
Helmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious paper work. 
WIDER ANGLE 
As the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their belongings, the regulars of Barracks H, among them Adolf, Ludwig, Herman and Franz, begin moving towards them to meet them.  Keltner turns to the new white-haired prisoner whose bunk is directly next to his. 
KELTNER I've seen you around the yard, but the others... 
WHITE-HAIRED MAN About thirty of them got here yesterday from the prison outside of Frankfurt. 
1ST NEW PRISONER (who occupies the bunk above the white- haired prisoner) For the last three months we've been shuttled from one camp to another. 
2ND NEW PRISONER (his bunk is the lower bunk on the direct opposite side) Now they're shuffling us from one side to another.  I think they're trying to lose us. 
HERMAN Do you think they're bringing in war prisoners? 
LUDWIG I don't know why they're sending them here...  we're overcrowded as it is. 
KELTNER No, no... it's got to be something else...  Otherwise they would have left the bunks. 
ADOLF It could be possible that he is fixing up the barracks for some of his lady friends. 
KELTNER That many women? 
HERMAN (standing at attention) Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN! 
All the men break out in laughter at Herman's comment and his actions... but the laughter is cut short as they HEAR the door open again, and they all look in that direction. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SHOOTING OVER the men onto the door, entering is the same guard that was just there... this time he enters with two more prisoners carrying their bunks.  One of them is JOSEF GALT, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of survival, and ERNST UHLMANN, a think little man with a face like a weasel... they follow the Guard into the barracks proper. 
GUARD ATTENTION !

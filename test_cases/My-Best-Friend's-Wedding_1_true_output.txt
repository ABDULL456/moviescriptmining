JULIANNE I wish. 
DIGGER Neosporin? 
JULIANNE Try less appropriate. 
DIGGER Ben Gay. 
JULIANNE That was Thursday. 
He stops on that note. 
DIGGER Elmer's Glue? 
JULIANNE DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION! 
She's hysterical. 
DIGGER I give. 
JULIANNE I can't even say it. 
Now.  He's curious. 
JULIANNE A hint.  The first word is "Preparation." Then comes a letter of the alphabet, perilously close to G. 
She reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT! KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink.  She LUNGES for it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm... 
DIGGER Considering the circumstances, I'm not wholly against suicide... 
Huh? 
DIGGER Just not by electrocution in front of me! 
Oh. 
DIGGER I've got this noon flight. 
He reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she LUNGES to grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch above the sink. 
JULIANNE How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor? 
DIGGER What do you suggest? 
She looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling iron.  And back. 
JULIANNE Maybe they just seal off this room.  They have others. 
He's staring at her.  Sweet, but intense. 
DIGGER I didn't mean about that. 
Oh.  Again. 
JULIANNE If I hear the words "tell the truth," or any paraphrase thereof, I dive into the sink and pull you with me. 
Looking at her.  Looking at her. 
DIGGER Let's go meet Michael.  I'll wait downstairs. 
INT.  ARMANI - MORNING 
Julianne has cleaned up pretty good.  She sits with Digger on a fashion-fabric sofa.  They are side-by-side, studying something with equal concentration.  And slight concern. 
DIGGER I suppose it's too late to start over. 
JULIANNE It's too late to start over. 
PULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a final fitting from a stylish fitter. 
MICHAEL You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out. 
JULIANNE Like I said, dazzling. 
DIGGER Is she going to dress you every day? 
Michael smiles over.  Digger smiles back.  They live each other. 
MICHAEL Yeah, it's in the contract. 
DIGGER (softly) Well, then, I'll take it up with her. 
Michael motions, okay, c'mon over.  Digger rises, goes to Michael, the fitter steps back as Digger shows him... 
DIGGER The cut here, here... this line... 
Fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the cloth straight down the spine... 
DIGGER ... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear. 
MICHAEL I should look different. 
DIGGER You should look like you dressed yourself. 
Yes? Michael's grin is back.  Playful and friendly. 
MICHAEL And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker? 
DIGGER (quiet smile) Something like that. 
Julianne loves that the boy are getting on. 
MICHAEL (means this) Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.

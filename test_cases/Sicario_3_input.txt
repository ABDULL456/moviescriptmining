They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the window, resting her heavy head on her fist. He looks back at Matt and Alejandro, both already asleep. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PROCESSING CENTER -- TUSCON -- NIGHT. 
The team walks from their parked car toward an irate BOB FISKE, 40'S, walking toward them. 
BOB What's the deal, Matt? Why you holding up my transports? 
MATT We'll be quick. 
BOB I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino's Pizza? 
MATT You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call. 
Doesn't introduce Alejandro and Bob doesn't ask- Kate notices. 
MACY I don't even know what we're doing here. (Pointing to his cigarette) Got another one of those? 
BOB Finish it before we get inside. 
He gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed warehouse growing closer. The dull murmur of four hundred people talking and sitting and moving and complaining is wafting out like an odor. 
Macy tries to suck the entire cigarette in one drag. Reggie leans into her. 
REGGIE What happened in El Paso? Talk to me. 
MACY We weren't in El Paso. 
REGGIE ... Where were you? 
MACY We were in Mexico. 
Reggie stops. Macy doesn't. She reaches the door and flicks the smoke on the ground. 
INT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS. 
The illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record. 
Women on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center, and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons... 
Three dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS   stand over them with M4s. 
BOB There you go. I'm starting the buses. When you're done with em, send em out. 
ALEJANDRO All the women can go. 
BOB Coulda told me that on the phone, Matt. 
MATT First I've heard it. 
They head toward the group of felons and the like as the women are moved out to the buses. 
ALEJANDRO Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez. 
Macy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn't know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have their hands behind their backs, zip tied. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Do you see? 
She scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90's. Diamond earrings, stares hard at her. 
MACY Him. 
Alejandro nods. 
ALEJANDRO Yes. Keep looking. 
She studies more faces. The ones that look like American gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how they lean against the wall... she understands now. 
MACY Yeah. I see it. 
She turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the migrants. 
Macy walks back to them. 
MACY (CONT'D) What are we looking for? 
MATT Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid.

(CUTTING) Maybe you need to make some. 
MARGARET Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. 
JANE That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! 
Margaret has no response. Jane runs off. 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY 
Margaret is alone, pouring a drink. She mixes in some ice -- then sees something odd. 
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house. Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps over, spying on them... They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat... then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. Huh? Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. 
ASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. Margaret's face darkens. 
MARGARET I'm not interested. She starts to close the door... but they continue. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? 
MARGARET I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently. 
ASIAN LADY #2 But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news. 
MARGARET 
(DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. 
ASIAN LADY #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? Margaret is lost. The ladies grab the opening. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. 
ASIAN LADY #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy 
(she pulls out a BIBLE and quickly thumbs to a page) "In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves. Lovers of money. Self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient --" 
MARGARET Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible. 
MARGARET Would you like to come in? 
CUT TO: 
LATER The three women sit. Margaret gazes... 
MARGARET It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. 
ASIAN LADY #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. 
MARGARET So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? 
The ladies nod. Margaret thinks. 
MARGARET I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws... 
ASIAN LADY #2 Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. 
(GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. 
MARGARET And how do you know...? 
ASIAN LADY #2 
(SHE SMILES) Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth. Beat. Margaret glances over at a half-completed "Keane" on the easel. A strange pause. 
MARGARET What does that mean, exactly? 
ASIAN LADY #2

INTEGRATED FINAL 26. 
29 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING 29 
Scott pees in a state of dreamy reverie. The PEE BAR above his head slowly reduces. He stares at himself in the mirror. Scott exits the bathroom, entering... 
30 INT. DREAM HIGH SCHOOL - ? 30 
...a long, empty HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. Scott's footsteps echo as he moves towards a classroom door with a STAR on it... RAMONA FLOWERS bursts through the door, skating past Scott and down the hall, PACKAGE from AMAZON clutched in her hand. Scott runs after her, around a corner, down a row of LOCKERS leading to...the outside of WALLACE'S APARTMENT??? 
31 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 31 
Scott LEAPS out of the futon and RUNS towards the front door, THROWING IT OPEN and startling Ramona Flowers just as she presses the doorbell. DINGY DONG... 
SCOTT Hi, um, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be. 
(BEAT) Do you want to go out sometime? 
RAMONA Um, no, that's okay. You just have to sign for this alright? 
SCOTT I just woke up, and you were in my dream. I dreamt you were delivering me this package. Is that weird? 
RAMONA It's not weird at all. 
SCOTT It's not? 
RAMONA No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use. It's like three miles in fifteen seconds. 
SCOTT Right...

RAMONA Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada. 
SCOTT You don't remember me do you? I met you at the party the other day. 
RAMONA Were you the Pac-Man guy? 
SCOTT No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy. You're Ramona Flowers right? 
RAMONA That's me. 
SCOTT So, you're like American? 
RAMONA Why, am I coming off as rude? 
SCOTT Not at all. Noooooo... Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen. 
RAMONA You know...you need to sign for this. Whatever this is? 
SCOTT It's something really cool. You'd be impressed. 
RAMONA You still have to sign. 
SCOTT But if I sign for it, you'll leave. 
RAMONA Yeah. That's how it works. 
SCOTT Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever. I mean...there are reasons for you to hang out with me? 
RAMONA You're all over the place.

Vernon and Carl are sitting talking. 
VERNON What did you want to be when you were young? 
CARL When I was a kid, I wanted to be John Lennon... 
VERNON Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying to make a serious point here...I've been teaching, for twenty two years, and each year...these kids get more and more arrogant. 
CARL Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern, the kids haven't changed, you have! You took a teaching position, 'cause you thought it'd be fun, right? Thought you could have summer vacations off...and then you found out it was actually work...and that really bummed you out. 
VERNON These kids turned on me...they think I'm a big fuckin' joke... 
CARL Come on...listen Vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you, huh? 
VERNON Hey...Carl, you think I give one rat's ass what these kids think of me? 
CARL Yes I do... 
VERNON You think about this...when you get old, these kids; when I get old, they're gonna be runnin' the country. 
CARL Yeah? 
VERNON Now this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night... That when I get older, these kids are gonna take care of me... 
CARL I wouldn't count on it! 
Vernon ponders that statement for a moment. CUT TO:

They are sitting on the floor in a circle. 
ANDREW What would I do for a million bucks? Well, I guess I'd do as little as I had to... 
CLAIRE That's boring... 
ANDREW Well, how'm I s'posed to answer? 
CLAIRE The idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit.  Like, uh, would you drive to school naked? 
Andrew laughs. 
ANDREW Um, uh...would I have to get out of the car? 
CLAIRE Of course... 
ANDREW In the spring, or winter? 
CLAIRE It doesn't matter...spring... 
ANDREW In front of the school or in back of the school? 
CLAIRE Either one... 
ANDREW Yes... 
ALLISON I'd do that!

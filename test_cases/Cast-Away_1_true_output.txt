He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual occurrence. 
MAN Hey. 
CHUCK Hey. 
BETTINA (O.S.) In here! 
The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from inside. 
EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER 
Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin. 
MAN Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on. Don't even have to bring us a package. 
CHUCK That was my last one. 
Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper. 
BETTINA The list of paints and brushes I did for you. 
He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it. 
BETTINA Keep painting.  Promise me. 
CHUCK Sure. 
EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore. 
EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER 
Chuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck. 
EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand. 
CHUCK Need some help? 
DRIVER You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road. 
EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement. 
EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER 
The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an open, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between them. 
DRIVER Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out by myself. 
Looks at his uniform.  At the bike. 
DRIVER You're not out of Pascagoula, are you? 
CHUCK No. 
Where is he from, anyway? 
CHUCK I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago. 
DRIVER Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup. 
CHUCK Sure. 
He picks up his bike. 
INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 
The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his uniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck. The Driver looks over at Chuck. 
DRIVER You're Chuck Noland. 
CHUCK Yeah. 
DRIVER/ERICA I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr. Robinson Crusoe. 
CHUCK Well -- 
ERICA I knew I recognized you.  My name's Erica. 
They smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more. 
ERICA Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story? 
CHUCK I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled. 
Erica laughs. 
ERICA Otherwise it's completely true. 
And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time. 
CHUCK Yeah, completely. 
She looks over at him with a grin. 
ERICA What brings you out to the sticks? 
CHUCK Had a package to deliver.

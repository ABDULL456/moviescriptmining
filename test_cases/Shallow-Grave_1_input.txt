DAVID I just thought we should discuss it. 
ALEX Take his legs. 
INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT 
In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They swear at one another and continue theri descent. 
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT 
Tim is ducking the Man again. He writhes and struggles but is powerless to stop it. 
EXT. BEHIND THE FLAT. NIGHT 
The back yard and back door of the flats. The door opens and Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards the van. 
INT. LANDING OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM. NIGHT 
From the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely still. Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down. 
ANDY You stupid bastard. 
INT. VAN. NIGHT 
Inside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the door. 
INT. VAN. NIGHT 
In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. Alex turns to the other two. 
ALEX Why don't we just draw lots for it? 
The other two remain silent. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing. 
JULIET OK. 
ALEX David? 
DAVID I don't know. 
ALEX Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't. 
Alex starts the engine of the van. 
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT 
Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of the van come into view. 
It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the van. 
In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds them out. 
ALEX All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play or not? 
Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.

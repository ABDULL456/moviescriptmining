BETSY We have been talking too much--so I'm going. 
ANNA Princess Betsy came to tell me . . . 
I don't want to hide anything from you . . . Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye--he's going away. I have said I can't receive him. 
Betsy kisses Anna. 
BETSY Goodbye, my treasure. 
Karenin follows Betsy out. Anna gives in to a moment of grief, and recovers herself when she hears the crack of Karenin's knuckles. He comes in. 
KARENIN I agree with you. As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here. 
ANNA I have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it. 
KARENIN But it is for you to decide. 
ANNA Yes, and I decided. 
KARENIN Then I am very glad that-- 
ANNA That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it. 
KARENIN Of course. Is there anything I can do for you? 
ANNA Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles. (PAUSE) I'm a bad woman. But I can't breathe. Your kindness which I can't repay, and your FORGIVENESS-- 
KARENIN You begged me for my forgiveness. 
ANNA But I didn't die and now I have to live with it! If only you would have gone on hating me. 
KARENIN But then--what? What? What do you want? 
Do you know what you want? 
Do you want to see Count Vronsky? 
ANNA (QUIETLY) Not to say goodbye. 
KARENIN I can't hear. 
ANNA Not to say goodbye. 
KARENIN (PAUSE) You would be lost. Irretrievably lost. You would have no position. And worse if we divorce. You would be the guilty party. That means you cannot legally remarry. Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name. And that is what you want! It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself. 
ANNA You forget something. Count Vronsky and I love each other. 
KARENIN And this love sanctifies a criminal folly? 
ANNA (CRIES OUT) All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart! 
KARENIN (PAUSE) I see. And Serozha . . . ? 
It's the crux for Anna, and she is prepared for it. 
ANNA I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him. When he knows about love, he'll forgive me. 
Karenin can see where this takes him. 
KARENIN Then I must choose the smaller sin. Vronsky robbed me of my cloak and I will give him my coat. I will give you grounds to divorce me, and I'll accept the scandal, the humilia- tion and the consequences to my career. 
ANNA No . . . I can't . . . 
KARENIN You may write to him but I would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house.

INT. BEDROOM ("THE SOUTH")--DAY 
Early morning. In a big untidy bed, Vronsky and Anna lie asleep, naked and satiated. The style of the room, and the warmth of the light, tell of the journey made, confirmed by the view from the window, an attractive panorama from an elevation above the sea. In the room, there are open, unpacked or partly unpacked trunks and cases, and, abandoned untidily, Anna's and Vronsky's clothes.

AGU (CONT'D) Why are you not talking, then? 
Griot hands the two boys a plastic container. 
GRIOT (WHISPERING) Morale booster. 
Agu smells it. Nauseating. Chicken Legs stifles a laugh. 
HOPE (WHISPERING) It is good juju, making you stronger and braver. 
Agu sniffs, then as it drips down his throat, tries to spit out the rest. 
AGU (WHISPERING) It is tasting like licking rock. (smacking his tongue) And eating pencil. 
Hope listens to his VHF Radio, turns to the rest... 
HOPE Shhh. They are coming. 
Agu notices all of the BOYS are lowering themselves even further into the bushes. 
Preacher posted behind a giant, red-dust-covered leaf, hisses at Agu, covered in ammunition belts, to scoot down with him. 
Agu notices the sudden stillness of everything, the only movement a swarm of mosquitoes descending upon them, he tries to beat them away. Then he feels breathing on his neck and turns slowly to see it is Strika. 
Strika motions, signaling him to focus down the road. The air wafts in translucent tendrils over the pavement. Then he sees it, rounding a bend, the dust cloud of a CONVOY of TRUCKS and LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLES rolling in their direction. 
AGU (V.O.) I am almost laughing and almost dying, even though I am not feeling like laughing. Inside my stomach and heart it is feeling like fire from a pepper. I am only thinking about what is going to be happening. 
Three trucks becomes FOUR TRUCKS, then FIVE. Large Caliber machine guns are mounted on some of them, as well as GOVERNMENT TROOPS who look out into the green margins of the road with distrust. 
The ground shakes as they roll over Agu's position. The wheels nearly as tall as Agu would be standing next to them. 
Everyone waits in anticipation, biting lips and focused as the last truck passes Agu. 
ANGLE FROM POV OF FIRST GOVERNMENT TRUCK 
A SQUAD of SBU-NDF SOLDIERS scurry across the road like a fleeing deer. Only one stays behind, CHICKEN LEGS, stopping, turning, revealing, an RPG. 
The PLF DRIVER, realizing, slams on the breaks. Grinds the transmission into a lower gear, then neutral, fighting to get it into reverse when. ZWOOOF -- the RPG slams into his cabin. 
BOOM. The first truck's engine compartment shatters in a hail storm of shrapnel, fire and smoke into the cabin. 
Hope signals aggressively. The SBU rushes onto the road dragging SPIKE STRIPS, RPGs and GPMGs. They ensure no retreat. 
For a second, nothing happens. Agu closes his ears, expecting more gun fire, then. 
The GOVERNMENT TROOPS hold their rifles into the air. 
ONE MAN in the convoy yells out... 
ARMY CORPORAL Please do not shoot us! 
Agu grips his machete harder. Sweat beads all over his face. He looks around petrified, confused, excited. 
COMMANDANT (O.S.) On the floor! 
Agu sees SEVENTY NDF SOLDIERS emerge from the jungle, ANNOUNCING their presence with an echoing BARK. An impressive show of scale of force. 
PREACHER Agu, where is the fucking ammunition? 
Agu remembers he forgot the extra ammunition. He scrambles back down into the ditch as... 
KPWAP! Agu flinches and ducks. Someone in the bush sprays the truck, bullets ricochet off of the metal door of the middle truck, a windshield is shattered. Then all the NDF soldiers open fire. It is a quick and effective slaughter. 
Agu holds his ears. It all happened so quickly he didn't see the full carnage, but when he gets up, the trucks are chewed up and the men inside are dead. 
COMMANDANT (O.S.) Disarm and disrobe them! 
Rambo repeats the CALL, moves forward with another SBU squad. 
Some of the Government Soldiers are crying, as Rambo's men kick away the weapons and yank off their clothes. 
Commandant, his ENTOURAGE, and CONTROLLER, emerge from the bush with guns aimed and ready. He is proud of the catch. 
Upon seeing him, NDF SQUADS move up the road to secure the front and down the road to secure their tail. 
The SBU moves to join the CENTER. Agu walks past a few trucks and stripped soldiers with necks strained towards death. 
Hope grabs Griot and Preacher, jumps into the back of a truck and looks around, throwing useless items over the side. 
Commandant and his entourage look for a healthy man and are disappointed by all the dead men. Finally, they find one, the CORPORAL, alive.

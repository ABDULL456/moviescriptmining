SAIL0R Met him through Santos...  Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos. 
Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8. 
SAILOR Lula, you there? 
LULA Yeah, Im here. 
SAILOR You upset with me? 
LULA No, Sailor darlin.  Just shockin sometimes when things arent the way you thought they were...  I been carryin a secret too... 
CUT TO: 
121. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The livingroom is on fire. 
The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom. 
The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window. Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel. 
LULA (voice-over) That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin...  I saw mama up in her room with Santos... 
CUT TO: 
122. INT. THUNDERBIRD - TWO LANE TEXAS FARM ROAD - NIGHT 
LULA ...They was laughin arm in arm like animals. 
SAILOR I didnt want to say it ... but I had a feelin Santos was up to somethin with your mama... 
LULA (quietly) My mama... (after a pause - she smiles) So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined. 
SAILOR They have, sugar. 
LULA I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together. 
SAILOR Its a comfortin idea. 
LULA Well, were really out in the middle of it now, aint we? 
SAILOR Theres worse places, honey. 
LULA If you say so. 
SAILOR Trust me on it. 
LULA (turns to him) I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I aint never trusted nobody before. 
SAILOR (after a moment) Well be alright, peanut, long as weve got room to move. 
LULA (looking into the highway) Whats that? 
SAILOR I dont know...  Looks like clothes. 
Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an overturned car. 
LULA Oh God, Sailor. 
SAILOR One bad car accident... 
LULA SAILOR!!! 
Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - blood draining out of several deep wounds. 
LULA Sailor, what are we gonna do? 
SAILOR I dont know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole. 
They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming. 
GIRL (completely gone in shock) Ive got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and I cant find it... My mothers going to kill me.  Its got all my cards in it...  It was in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone. MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME. 
The girl starts walking back toward the car. 
SAILOR Lets get ahold a her quick. 
LULA You think shes gonna make it? 
SAILOR Dont know, but shes gonna bleed all over our car, Ill tell ya that... (to Girl) Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta come with us, honey. 
Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm. 
GIRL OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE... ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn sticky stuff in my hair... 
She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head. 
GIRL Gotta find my wallet. (to Sailor) Dont you say one word of this to my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me. 
The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and Lula each take an arm and try to help her. 
GIRL WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

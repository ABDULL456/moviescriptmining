{"train": "DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward. \nNEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER \nTurning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead, beneath the brim of the cowboy hat. \nRESUME ERIC'S GRAVE \nas blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave. \nTIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW \nshaking off rain.  Watching intently. \nCLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND \nBlack gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting. \nRESUME ERIC'S GRAVE \nThe turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white parts the earth to grasp the rose. \nSKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE \nas the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own headstone. \nLOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC \nPale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning. \nANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC \nas he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s. \nERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY \nwater-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies to the tree. \nANGLE -  ERIC \nWatching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision. The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy. \nERIC What the hell are you? \nSKULL COWBOY Interested?  Follow the crow. \nNB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising. \nEric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the Skull Cowboy is gone. \nLOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW \nTaking wing in the rain, showing the way. \nANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC \nalone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches off, following the crow. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH: \nA candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb. \nINT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT \nA MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup, ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her darting eyes. \nCOMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy. And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of arson cocktail to Skank. \nT-BIRD Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof accelerator.  I squirt you with this, you could jump in the Detroit river and burn all the way to the bottom. \nINSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver canisters, an LED timer, wires. \nT-BIRD (CONT'D) You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once, from all the crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen that. \nHe CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs. \nT-BIRD (CONT'D) We're ready to rock. \nSkank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks it up.  Looks through it for valuables. \nSKANK What about working girl? \nINTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions. \nT-BIRD What about her? \nSKANK I say we leave her here to fry, man. \nALBRECHT Here now!  You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me?  I'm a police officer... \nThe woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now. \nWOMAN He touched me and it stopped.  The pain. \nALBRECHT What did you say? \nWOMAN I saw a ghost... \nHer eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms. \nALBRECHT Oh no... don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now... shit! \nHIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY \nBOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police units screech up to assist. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT \nEric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games. \nANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING) \nCircling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric. \nBACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - (\"CROWVISION\") \n\"CROWVISION\" is what the crow \"gives\" Eric to see.  Visually distinct and immediately identifiable. \nERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES \nWhich he's already seen through the crow's eyes. \nANGLE - ERIC \nlooking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand. Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield from: \nANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES \nThe rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and debris. \nANGLE - WITH ERIC \nhe reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls. \nANGLE - THE CROW \nlanding on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat boots in the trash.  Flames. \nLOW ANGLE - ERIC \nThe blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery -- \nPUSH IN ON ERIC \nas his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow. His glance at the bird is almost accusatory. \nANGLE - THe CROW \nInscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place. \nANGLE - ERIC'S FEET \nbare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s. SIRENS \nERIC Fire.  In the rain. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT \nWe are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this establishment since we are -- \nTIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10 \nThinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots. Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people CROSS FRAME. \nGRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal. His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in just a minute. \nThey have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of Eric in the photo. \nAs the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- suspiciously -- to Nwa. \nNGO NWA He will see me... unannounced. \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR \nAs Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either side. \nSkank riles \nSKANK Hey, blow me, fat boy! \nJust as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank. \nGIDEON Blow yourself, bigmouth. \nT-BIRD (interposing) Whoa, hey, whoa. (hands up) Business. \nHe lifts a small carton onto the counter. \nGIDEON Whatcha got? \nNEW ANGLE - COUNTER \nTransaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection. \nT-BIRD Coupla more rings... 24k. \nGIDEON 18k.  Crap. \nT-BIRD ...necklace... pearls... \nGIDEON Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake, \nT-BIRD Leather purse... \nHe hands though the bag rested from the woman. \nGIDEON What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? (doesn't matter) Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a -- \nT-BIRD Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile. \nSKANK You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile. \nMention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT \nEric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird. \nERIC All right. \nAnd he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: \"Did I do that?\" and runs out of the frame. \nANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN. \nas he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain. \nHe jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic. \nFAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW \nkeeping airborne, keeping ahead. \nMOVING ANGLE - ERIC \nEyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space... \nUP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS \nAs Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building. \nCLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE \nas Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward. \nANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET \nEric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass. ERIC Gotcha. \nHe completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat. \nUP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL \nIt's a looooooong way down. \nANGLE - ALLEYWAY \nas Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from facedown to his back. \nTIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE \nas he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece. \nANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW \nIt flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off. \nFUNBOY (O.S.) Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --? \nDARLA (to Elly) Out.  Now.  I gotta work. \nRACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. \nINT. LOFT - NIGHT \nAs Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of disuse. \nPULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW \nas Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged. \nNEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN \nHe scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor. \nERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW \nA white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light. \nANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT \nHe kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric. \nCLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND. \nas the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH. \nFLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he saw:  Shelly, holding the cat. \nFLASH ENDS. \nUP ANGLE - ERIC \nWincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger... \nFLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time. \nFLASH ENDS. \nREVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC \nas the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way. \nCLOSE-UP - ERIC \nvising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding. \nERIC No!  Don't look!  No! No! \nHe whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall. FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they collapse on the bed. \nFLASH ENDS. \nANGLE - ERIC \nslowly pulling his arm out of the wall. \nERIC (whispering) Stop it. \nHis eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man. \nANGLE - GABRIEL \nwatching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD. \nINT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT \nAs a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots. \nFUNBOY (O.S.) Let's have some fun. \nFunboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down. T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy. \nT-BIRD\tYou first. \nTIN-TIN You're outta your fuckin' mind. \nInto it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank. \nT-BIRD No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is. \nSkank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's face, cocking. \nSKANK Fuck you, T-Bird. \nJust as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face. \nWeirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow. \nTIGHT ON ERIC \nAs he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the bird's eyes.  He rolls. \nON THE CROW \nIt hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's ROLL finishes him up nearby. \nERIC Goddammit. \nHe grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH. \nFLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder. \nFLASH ENDS. \nRESUME ERIC \nvising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain. \nSKULL COWBOY Get it? \nERIC Leave me alone -- ! \nHe looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there. \nSKULL COWBOY (contempt) Do something about it. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY. \nA horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping. \nANGLE - SKULL COWBOY \nas close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as -- \nANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC \nFLIES feet first out into space. \nCLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME \nEric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps! \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT \nHigh above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside- down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip. \nCLOSE-UP - ERIC \nEvery muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he relaxes, and swings back inside. \nINT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT \nHe arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. \"meow\". \nANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT \nERIC I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet. \nHe picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer. \nERIC (CONT'D) The last time we saw each other, I didn't do so well. (holds cat up) Huh, Gabriel? \nHe moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask. \nERIC (CONT'D) I bet you need some cat food... right? \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING: \nEric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT (\"CROWVISION\") \nTwo men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, \"Got a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,\" RAZZLES b.g. \nEXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT \nAs Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops. And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley. \nEXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT \nHe pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept. Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash. \nTIN-TIN Three hundred and your a gunslinger. \nHIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO \nAs the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad. \nGideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him: \nERIC I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.  Gold. \nAs Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter. \nGIDEON You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains! \nAnd he tries to nail Eric with the knife. \nNEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS \nNo Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head. Drops down like a spider and collects the knife. \nERIC I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... \"T-Bird\"? \nIN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON \nEric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red. \nERIC (CONT'D) Cute nickname, don't you think? \nGIDEON (gasping) I ain't got no fuckin' ring. \nERIC Wrong answer. \nEric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls! \nGIDEON All's I got is in a box!  Behind the counter! \nEric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized. \nANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER \nscans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun. Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box. \nCLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND. \nDozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them. \nTIGHTER ON ERIC \nHe brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o.s. \nERIC No... no... no... no... \nHe tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until: \nCLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND \nObliterated by a stab of brilliant white light -- \nFLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision... \nFLASH ENDS. \nRESUMING ERIC \nHe closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor. \nERIC Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath.  You have one chance to live. GIDEON No fucking way.  He'll kill me. \nERIC Who would waste time killing you... besides me? \nGideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand. \nGIDEON (cowed) Top Dollar. \nERIC Another jolly nickname? \nGIDEON You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar. \nERIC T-Bird? \nGIDEON Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar. \nERIC A whole club of pirates, with pirate names... \nEric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering. \nLOW ANGLE - ERIC \nLooking down at Gideon in revulsion. \nERIC You feed off the living. \nSMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches for it. \nON GIDEON \nand the silhouette.  Mouth hangs. \nALBRECHT You're the one who did Tin-Tin... \nPULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face. \nALBRECHT (CONT'D) Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell. (beat) Least he didn't do that \"walking against the wind\" shit;  I hate that. \nEXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH. \nA night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II. \nINT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT \nT-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored, the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what. \nDICKEY BIRD T-Bird.  Thrill me. \nT-BIRD Business. \nT-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes open for him. \nINT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT \nT-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it. \nPORN QUEEN (O.S.) I don't know how to describe how I feel, Lance -- so restless -- \nPORN KING (O.S.) You're my Moon Queen, Angelique. \nPORN QUEEN (o.S.) Oooh -- I want you're rocket right now in my Sea of Tranquility -- Lance -- \nANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS \nAs T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time. \nANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS. \nAs T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him. \nINT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT \nAs T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug paraphernalia, weapons. \nAcross the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by Showtime's exterior neon. \nThis is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge. \nTOP DOLLAR Wild fucking night.  I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead. \nT-BIRD And Gideon's just burned all the down to the foundation. \nTop's eyebrows go up.  Oh really? \nT-BIRD (CONT'D) I didn't have nothin to do with that. \nTOP DOLLAR Bet that pisses you off, right? \nT-BIRD Top, what the fuck is going on tonight? \nTOP DOLLAR Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive.  No combat moves until I check this out. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION\") HIGH ANGLE \nTaking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an abandoned car. \nANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY. \nSeated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll. \nCLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY \nShe doesn't notice someone is watching her yet. \nTIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY \nShe looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame. \nELLY What are you supposed to be?  A clown? \nCLOSE-UP - ERIC \nHe smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past his crow makeup. \nERIC Sometimes. \nHe glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly. \nWIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY \nELLY He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much. \nElly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the white face talking to the little girl down on the block. \nELLY (CONT'D) Can you play that thing or do you just carry it around everywhere? \nElly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back. \nERIC I can pick out a tune now and again. \nELLY Can you play \"Teddy Bears' Picnic?\" (re: doll) It used to be her favorite. \nERIC Does she have a name? \nELLY No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions. \nElly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly unexpected flash. \nFLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity. \nFLASH ENDS. \nRESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND \nPain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. \nELLY (OS) (smart alec) Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...? \nEric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll. \nELLY (CONT'D) Do you feel okay. \nERIC No. \nELLY You gotta go now, I bet. \nERIC I have to go. \nHalf-zomboid, half-determined, he exits. \nINT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE \nAs he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer: \nGRANGE Top Dollar? \nBOUNCE Never heard of him. \nGRANGE Funboy? \nBOUNCER Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin' Darla.  Pay for your own beer and they'll prob'ly be down before you can drink it. \nINT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.

Smoking. \nANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND \nSubject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face. \nAs Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at Club Trash. \nA DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle of all this research, startling Albrecht. \nANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM \nANNABELLA Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit. \nALBRECHT I knew that. \nAlbrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light. \nCLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin. \nIt reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court Apartments... \nALBRECHT Another nice white girl with a cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign. \nAlbrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face. \nALBRECHT (CONT'D) Shelly Webster.  And her nice white boyfriend, Eric Draven. \nWith a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make- up, like the blood. \nANNABELLA Your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the Beat Patrol, just like in a bad detective story, Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again? \nFUNBOY (CONT'D) BANG!  He shoots, he scores! \nThen his expression drags a little bit. \nANGLE - ERIC \nLooking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest. \nERIC Bull's eye.  Good shot. \nANGLE - DARLA \nwho starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands. \nERIC Stay. \nEric twists her arm. \nCLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM. \nwhere we may clearly see the needle tracks. \nUP ANGLE - ERIC \nERIC Morphine is bad for you. \nHe holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's, Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor. Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps. \nANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING \nFUNBOY How the hell did you do that? ERIC Magic. \nFunboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar. \nFUNBOY Either die or do a solo. \nEric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing. \nERIC Neither. \nFUNBOY Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself. \nFunboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly. \nFUNBOY I hate trespassers! (whack!) I hate prowlers! (whack!) I hate peeping toms! (whack!) And right now I hate you! \nANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM \nas Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing. Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it. \nFUNBOY Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left. \nIn a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed. \nFUNBOY Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd! \nERIC Does it hurt? \nFUNBOY Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?! \nEric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted. \nERIC I have some pain killer right here. \nAnd he fills the syringe all the way. \nANGLE ON FUNBOY \nas he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing terror. \nFUNBOY No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- ! \nERIC Your pain ends now. \nAnd Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse. \nEric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes. \nThe Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat. \nSKULL COWBOY Howdy (beat) You look a mess.  Like an ole cooter dog. \nTIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE \nstreaked with -- mostly -- his own blood. \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC \nSKULL COWBOY Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we? \nERIC (CONT'D) Walk with me. \nAs Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk. \nANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET \nALBRECHT You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend -- \nERIC I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us? \nALBRECHT You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital. \nThey stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look. \nALBRECHT (CONT'D) Hey, you asked, man. (beat) She held on for thirty hours in intensive care.  Hemorrhage, trauma.  He body just finally gave it up. (beat; regret) I saw it and couldn't do jack for her. \nEric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines. Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes. \nTIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL \nWe see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the Flash. \nNEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT \nAnd Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror. \nALBRECHT You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened. \nERIC The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her. \nUnderstandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette. \nALBRECHT You gotta understand -- I was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me before she died. \nEric lowers his head, penitent. \nERIC My name. \nALBRECHT (fizzles) I'm sorry as hell, man. \nERIC Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change... \nTIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC \nEric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it. \nERIC Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night. \nALBRECHT I should be trying to stop you. \nEric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette. \nERIC Thank you.  For giving a damn. \nALBRECHT My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these. \nAs a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame. \nANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS \nto see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric. He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again. \nALBRECHT Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that. \nMOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF \nCoat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves away from Albrecht's position. \nINT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT \nLao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to him. \nGRANGE The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped.  Three stories. \nLao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's tale. \nLAO Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird? \nGRANGE (puzzled) No.  I saw a guitar. (beat; irritated) This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? (beat) There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood. \nLao's expression is one of sublime content. \nLAO Good. \nGrange It could've been a chicken... \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - (\"CROWVISION\") \nA LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the store side. \nSPEEG I hate this cream stuff.

Drive faster. \nEric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's tape.  What Eric needs. \nANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR \nas he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, \nERIC (CONT'D) You're very popular.

You're Elly, right?  I know your mom. \nElly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car is parked across the street, b.g. \nELLY A lot of people \"know\" my mom. \nGrange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey. \nGRANGE I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star. \nELLY I don't know you. \nGRANGE (easily) I'd like to get in touch with him. \nElly sizes Grange up. \nELLY You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for? \nGRANGE I'm looking for a good guitar man. \nELLY Right. \nGrange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to Mickey. \nELLY (CONT'D) You buying? (cuts him some slack) He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention. \nGRANGE I need to find him kind of soon, Elly. \nINT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY \nNo shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode. \nHe twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe. \nFLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the floor... \nFLASH ENDS. \nLOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC \nhanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up. \nANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM \nembracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's. \nFLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight. \nFLASH ENDS. \nANGLE - RESUMING ERIC \nas he drops the dress.

But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes. \nFLASH ENDS. \nANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW \nHis GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before him on the sill. \nERIC That's better. \nHe wipes his torso down with a towel. \nERIC (CONT'D) It's almost time. \nHe holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful fist. \nINT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT \nTIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.

(to Top Dollar) One moment. \nAs he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair. \nERIC Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down. \nWithout a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls all the way down. \nEXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nDamaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg and MJ.

I never saw you. \nERIC Do you know what you destroyed? \nTOP DOLLAR Take the dope, too. \nEric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething. \nERIC A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no. \nTOP DOLLAR That's ancient history. \nERIC It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed? \nTop Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger. \nTOP DOLLAR Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face! \nERIC You don't even remember... \nTOP DOLLAR I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story. \nERIC Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you. \nAnd he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose. \nFLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared. \nFLASH ENDS. \nANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC \nTop is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.

ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy. \nERIC Funboy had to leave this mortal coil. \nALBRECHT Yeah, among others. (sees Eric's condition) Hey, man -- you're hit. \nERIC It's only a flesh wound. \nALBRECHT It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds. \nEric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff. \nERIC You shouldn't smoke these. \nHe pitches the smoke out the open car window. \nALBRECHT Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead. \nEric turns back to Albrecht. \nERIC I'm finished. \nEric shoots him a doubtful look. \nERIC (CONT'D) I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.

(beat) A closure. \nAnd Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier. \nHolds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject: Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera. \nHe chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath. \nERIC Better now.  I feel good.  How are you, Elly, my friend? \nElly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently. \nERIC What is it? ELLY I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even with the makeup and stuff you wore. (beat) You really loved her, didn't you? \nCLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE \nThe photo burns and blackens in the grate. \nERIC You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives. \nELLY (upset) She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair. \nERIC Elly... \nHe draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb. \nERIC (CONT'D) Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes that's really tough.  I cry.  But if the people we love are gone, we keep them -- \nHe taps Elly's temple, then his won. \nERIC (CONT'D) -- right here.  It's a big responsibility.  And that makes it okay to mourn. (beat) I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad. \nElly gives Eric a hug. \nELLY You look funny without your white face on.

He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to Elly. \nERIC (CONT'D) I have something else for you. \nBACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g. \nELLY Nobody ever gave me something like that before.  Ever. \nEric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS. \nERIC Shelly would've wanted you to have it.

It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument. \nANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE \nShe hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird. \nELLY Oh, scary. \nThe bird blinks at her from the headstone. ELLY What are you, like, the night watchman? \nAnother blink from El Birdo. \nCAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH \nas she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in the middle of the city. \n", "test1_true": "CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard. \nMICKEY (O.S.)

Mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling the dog in the bun.

Forget that, and you can forget it all. \nThe Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.

Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment? \nALBRECHT This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin. \nTORRES Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names? \nALBRECHT He was a runner for Top Dollar.

Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol. Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him.

I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them. \nERIC You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away. (beat, gasping) I don't have any power for you to take. \nLAO I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief. \nLAO (CONT'D) Time for you to die for me.

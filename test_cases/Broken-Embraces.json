{"test1_input": "HARRY Is that so? You must be the only one. \n40. HARRY'S HOME. VESTIBULE AND KITCHEN. INT. DAY. 2008. \nAt this exact moment, Diego enters. Mariacruz opens the door for him. Just in time to hear Ray's question. \nRAY What happened to Mateo Blanco? \nHARRY \nWhy do you ask? \n40 A. \nDiego goes to the kitchen. Harry has heard him, he knows he's there, if he hasn't called him it's because he doesn't need him. \nRAY Because he vanished from public life... \nHARRY It would seem that way. \nRAY Almost as if he'd died. \nHARRY Yes . . . (Ironically) I lost track of him some time ago. \nRAY I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film. \nHARRY Whose? \nRAY Mateo Blanco's. The first five are stupendous. You were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you explain that the last one was a disaster? \nHARRY (Made uncomfortable by the topic) Films turn out well or badly. The reason is always a mystery. (Mateo switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for comedy). But tell me about the story you want to write. \nRay X measures his words, it's very important to him and he doesn't want to do so hastily. \nRAY ... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge, one against the memory of his father. \nHARRY Why does the son desire revenge? \nRAY (Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his life, practically nullifying him while he lived. The father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic, very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone has a price and that's how he behaves with people. I don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting someone like this... \nHarry does not allay his doubt. \nHARRY When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are you referring to? \nRAY X Economic, with everything that entails. He is a broker, of the generation of speculators that made quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations, and lives under his shadow, trying to please the father in everything. Despite being a bit... homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a \nson that hates him just as much as he hates his own father. When the father dies, the son is finally able to rebuild his life. That is his salvation and his revenge. \nHARRY I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are looking for. \nRAY X You are, you don't know how much! \nHarry registers what he has just heard. \nRAY X I will pay whatever you ask. \nHARRY It's too personal. \nRAY X Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic, rather, I think of it as a base from which to develop a fiction. \nHARRY Thanks, but no. (He rises) And now, if you don't mind... \n41. CONTINUED. \nHe calls Diego. The boy responds in that instant, he was in the kitchen, waiting for Harry to call him. Ray X will not give up, so he writes his telephone number on a piece of paper and places it in his hand. \nRAY X There you have my phone number, if you change your mind. \nHarry is still standing, with the piece of paper in his hand. Diego observes both men. Ray gets up. \nRAY X I am sure we will see each other again. \nHARRY In my case, that would be a miracle. \nDiego accompanies him to the door. And closes it behind him. Harry opens his desk's drawer and places the piece of paper with Ray's telephone number inside. He rummages through the drawer's interior until he finds a key. He grabs it. \n42. CONTINUED. \nHarry and Diego are now alone, in the den. Ruminating over Ray X's visit and the story he was proposing Harry. \nHARRY Did you overhear that? \nDIEGO Yes... I'm flipping out! Why did he ask you if Mateo had died? \nHARRY \nTo provoke me... I don't know... Help me find something... (he points toward the drawers at the bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to open one of them) Look inside that drawer. \nDiego opens the drawer with the key Harry has given him. The drawer is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed in a certain order. There is a black notebook. A box with Mexican handicrafts. Some 1980s postcards as well some from other decades, some movie postcards, some others of exotic landscapes... Some of the groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes, boxes or transparent binders. For Diego it's like looking into a treasure chest. It has been many years since that drawer has been opened. This was out of respect, not from lack of curiosity, Diego would never do so behind Harry's back. \nHARRY Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of the photographs must have the date on it. \nAfter tossing aside various envelopes, Diego finds a lot of photographs of the shooting, dated `94. He takes them out of their envelope. He shuffles through them, until he pauses at one. \n", "test1_true": "HARRY Who? \nDIEGO The man who just left. \nHARRY \n(Rising) Describe the picture to me. \nDIEGO It's from the shoot. (He looks at the box from where he's taken it). He is carrying a small camera, like a Super 8. \nHARRY It's a 16mm. Are you sure it's him? \nDIEGO He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him. He is talking to you. \nHARRY What am I saying? \nDIEGO I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks like a pack of cigarettes. \nHARRY It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it and I am refusing it. \nDIEGO Who is he? \nHARRY Ernesto Martel's son. \nHarry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts. He would have preferred to be mistaken. \nHARRY (Serious and pensive) You can put them away now... \nDiego returns the different sets of photographs to their place, inside the drawer a photo appears of Lena's face, in close-up. It's the same woman who appears in sequences 20 through 36. \nThe drawer closes, darkness engulfs its interior, drowning Lena's image, soon reborn in the next sequence. \n43. HOME, ERNESTO MARTEL SENIOR. (1992) \nOut of the darkness, Lena's image emerges, the year is `92: A close- up of the woman, looking at herself in the mirror, touching up her makeup. She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts it on. \nA few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after tucking in his shirt tail. The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who get along. They are preparing to attend a concert. Ernesto is a big fan of classical music. \nLena looks rejuvenated and more refined. Her life and her facial skin have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office. The moles have disappeared from her face. Her demeanor is still adult, that of a young woman who has experienced life. \nErnesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard for him to believe that \"such beauty\" belongs to him. \n44. CONTINUED. \nThe phone rings. Ernesto Senior picks up the handset. His relaxed countenance changes the second he hears the voice on the other end. \nIt's his second wife, whom he divorced years ago. He treats her with disregard. \nERNESTO S. I can't talk now, Rosanna. \nOFF It's about your son. I have caught him trying on my dresses. And it's not the first time... \nERNESTO S. It's your fault, you made him effeminate to humiliate me! \nOFF That's not the problem, the boy is very depressed, I've had to take him to a psychiatrist. \nERNESTO S. Don't call him \"boy\". He is already seventeen. \nOFF The doctor has told me he is in need of a father figure... I think I am going to send him your way so that he can spend some time with you, after all you are his father. \nERNESTO If I haven't been a good father in eighteen years, I don't think I can learn to be one precisely now. \nOFF How can you speak like that! Have you no feelings? \nERNESTO (Looks at Lena, intently) I have them. Very deep feelings, they just don't include either of you. \nWhile he speaks, Lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to put on, she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval, something he gives without pausing his phone conversation. \nLena makes a gesture of reproach. Ernesto should not speak to his ex- wife in that tone. \nOFF If anything happens to him, you'll know who's at fault. \nERNESTO Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna. Tell Ernesto that if he wants to talk to me he should call me himself. \nErnesto Martel Senior hangs up, bewildered. \n45. CONTINUED. 1992. \nLENA (In reprimand) Don't be so harsh with them, Ernesto! \nHe sips from his drink, or he serves himself another one if he has already finished the first. \nERNESTO Blackmailers! \nLENA Why don't you invite your son to spend a few days here? \nERNESTO It'd be better if you didn't get involved with them, Lena. \nErnesto takes a sip from his drink. \nLENA He can keep me company... Does he like movies or theater? \nErnesto Senior casts her a sideways glance. \n", "test1_id": 2400, "test2_input": "DIEGO Yes. \nJUDIT I was very worried about you! \nDIEGO Mateo has looked after me day and night... \nJUDIT Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...? \nDiego had not realized. \nDIEGO Yes... \nJUDIT \nToday's his birthday, we must get him something... What have you been up to all this time? \nDIEGO Nothing... Watching movies... and talking... \nJUDIT (As if it were something strange) Talking? \nDIEGO Yes... \nJUDIT What about? \nDIEGO Mom, please! \nJudit looks at her son. She finds him different. As if all the confidences shared with Harry had left a physical and visible mark on him. Diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking. \nJUDIT OK. So what happened to you? (Sort of joking) I don't know if I should believe the thing about the stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a script... \nDIEGO (Elusive) (I suffered) ... an accident. But I would rather not speak of that right now... \nJUDIT (Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident? \nDIEGO It's hard to explain. \nJUDIT (Orders him, annoyed) Try to! I am not that stupid! \nDIEGO \nLet's leave it for another time, yes? I am all well now. \nJudit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the same way that she could before she left on her trip. Those two weeks have irreversibly changed him. \nJUDIT What's wrong with you, Diego? \nDIEGO Nothing. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to buy a present for Mateo. \nJUDIT (Repeats) For Mateo... \nDIEGO Alright, Harry. \n(Offended, she doesn't want her son to think she is a drag, so she makes an effort not to bombard him with questions) \nJUDIT Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of having two names. \nDiego disappears and leaves her in mid-sentence. (Is this his way of avenging himself? Perhaps his reaction is unfair, but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother, answering thousands of questions regarding an \"accident\" when there has been another \"accident\" that he is much more intrigued by and that she has kept silent for fourteen years.) \n153. MATEO-HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. \n(The maid may be around) \nMateo goes to open the door. Judit has the key in one hand and a huge flower bouquet in the other. They greet each other enthusiastically. Mateo-Harry attempts to hug her but his arms collide with the flowers. \nJUDIT Wait, my arms are full... \nMATEO Are those flowers? \nJUDIT Yes! Happy Birthday! \nCut to. \n154. MATEO-HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. \nMateo and Judit talk, they are sitting on a sofa, the conversation is already mid-way. \nJUDIT Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank you! \nMATEO You've been looking after me for fourteen years now... \nJudit brushes his acknowledgement off, with a half-smile. \nJUDIT \nI've found him somewhat hostile. He left without telling me what it was that happened... Will you tell me? \nMATEO I don't know. It should be your son to tell you. \nJudit is upset by both of their evasiveness. \nJUDIT What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo? \nMATEO (He evades the first question, but responds to the second one.) Two weeks ago, at the place where he D.J.'s, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that had been spiked with G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola. \n", "test2_true": "MATEO Yes. It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres before he drank from his friend's glass... \nJUDIT And... what happened... exactly? \nMATEO (Being vague.) He was badly affected. He spent two days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here. \nJudit looks at him, horrified. She can't seem to comprehend such a turbulent and simple story. \nJUDIT Diego's a drug addict? \nMATEO No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing liquid ecstasy by mistake... \nJUDIT But how can one make a mistake with something like that? \nMATEO At first glace one cannot tell the difference. Both glasses contained Coca-cola... It's not the first time it happens... \nJudit sighs, defenseless and horrified. \nMATEO Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed... \nJUDIT (That I wouldn't be alarmed?!) Well, he hasn't succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me, no? \nMATEO He is wanting to do so! \nJudit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it. \nJUDIT Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn't answer! \nMATEO Then you should try answering him, when he asks you. \nJudit smokes in silence, she is curious to know what Mateo and Diego have been talking about in her absence, but she doesn't dare ask Mateo. \nJUDIT The two of you are acting very differently. Both of you. You both have changed. \nShe laments it, as if she had been put aside and they had not taken her into account. \nCut to. \n155. \"NO VIEWS\" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008. \nAT THE BAR BEFORE ONE ENTERS THE RESTAURANT. Judit and Mateo are having something to drink. Mateo tilts his head subtly in front of Judit. \nMATEO You smell good... \nJUDIT (Insecure) I have put on some makeup and I am dressed as a woman. \nMATEO What's the dress like? \nJudit describes it, with few words and almost shyly. \nMATEO \nAnd the hair? How are you wearing your hair? It's been so long since I've asked you that I don't even know whether it's long or short. \nThe fact that Mateo betrays that type of interest flatters and disconcerts her. \nJUDIT I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short. \nMATEO Short like Jean Seberg in \"Breathless\"? Like Joan of Arc on the bonfire? Like Liza Minnelli in \"Cabaret\"? Or like Yul Brynner? \nJUDIT Short, or rather, very short, like that of all fortysomethings who want to appear younger. \nMATEO I am sure it looks good on you. Thanks for dressing up for me, Judit... \nDiego looks at them, amused. He hands Mateo three DVDs (Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" (or the Coen Brother's \"Fargo\"), Tarantino's \"Kill Bill,\" and Kiarostami's \"Taste of Cherry\"). Near them, on the bar table, two couples talk excitedly as if they were about to go on a ride at an Amusement Park. \nThe barman tells them they may now enter. \n156. \"NO VIEWS\" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008. \nOnce they've crossed the doorway, a man signals them to follow him. He's a blind man that, like Mateo, moves smoothly, he knows the place by heart. The restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness, all the waiters, men and women, are blind. The one in charge of Mateo, Diego, and Judit introduces himself: \nJAVIER My name is Javier. How many are you? \nMATEO Three. \nThere is not a single light inside. The following sequences take place in absolute darkness. \nJAVIER Please, grab onto each other's shoulders and follow me in Indian-file. I will guide you to your table. It's number eight. \nJUDIT What is the idea here, Harry? \nMATEO We are dinning in darkness. \nJAVIER You didn't know this, ma'am? \nJUDIT (Anxious, feeling slightly ridiculed) No... \nJAVIER You should have been warned, but don't worry. People get used to it after a few minutes. \n157. \"NO VIEWS\" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008. \nThey have arrived to their table, as signaled by the waiter. Table number eight. He tells them where to sit. \n", "test2_id": 2401, "test3_input": "JUDIT Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep soon. \nDIEGO Call me, if you are not feeling well... \nHe kisses her twice and exits. The curtains that cover a large window that looks out into an interior terrace are made from the same material as those that Mateo has in his bedroom. \n168. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAWN. 2008. \nThe next day. Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the computer. It's open. There are not many things inside (credit cards, envelopes with money, a jump drive, the MP3, etc.), he goes through it meticulously until he finds the note that Ray X had left him the day he came to ask him if they could write a script together. Ray X has hand-written his own telephone number on the note. He goes over it with his fingertips, as if he could see through them. \nHe dials a familiar number, Diego's. \n169. JUDIT'S HOME. DIEGO'S BEDROOM. INT. DAWN. 2008. \nDiego's mobile phone vibrates four or five times. But Diego is sleeping and he doesn't wake up. The mobile phone stops vibrating. In all the scenes where Mateo is alone at home, he never turns on the light. He will be in the dark, lightly illuminated by any light that the cracks in the windows let through. \nRETURN TO 168. \nMateo leaves him a message: \"I am sorry to call you so early. Tell your mother to call me as soon as she can.\" \n170. HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. 2008. \nAs usual, Mateo buys his newspaper at the same news-agent. He turns his body toward the Modeling Agency, but no one there enters or exits whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar. There are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all heading, like zombies, to work. \n171. BAR ACROSS. 8 IN THE MORNING. EXT. INT. DAY. 2008. \nHe enters the bar where his Waiter Friend works. The place has just opened. There are very few clients. He greets him. \nWAITER FRIEND Why here so early? \nMATEO I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number? \nHe hands him the phone and the piece of paper where Ray X's number is written. \n172. KITCHEN, JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. \nDiego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and Judit. He works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a generous and varied breakfast, toast, juice, coffee and tea, marmalade, toasted bread spread with oil and tomato, etc.. Judit appears through one of the kitchen doors, calm, with a look of having rested (but also with the hangover of having survived a nightmarish day, the day before). Diego does not hear her approach. The mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender smile. When Diego turns to look, the tenderness disappears a little, more out of modesty and a lack of habit. In any case, Judit enjoys the peacefulness of the moment: her son caring for her after the storm. Judit looks over the culinary display. \nJUDIT How impressive! \nDIEGO I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same for Mateo... \nJudit's expression changes, now a bit more somber. \nDIEGO Are you OK? \nJUDIT Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally and I know how to stop it... \nDIEGO It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop out of your stomach. \nJUDIT \nIt's not a bad way of describing a panic attack... (Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego, there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday. \nAssuming it will be painful, he attempts to dissuade her: \nDIEGO About Mateo? \nJUDIT Yes. \nDIEGO You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast. \nJUDIT If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact. \nDIEGO The year of punk. \nJUDIT Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved... \nDIEGO In a love affair? \nJUDIT Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his side... That didn't keep us from working together... until now... \nDIEGO I knew all that, or I imagined it... \nJUDIT There's one more thing... Mateo is your father... \nDiego looks at her, astonished. \nDIEGO And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological father? You made him up? \nJUDIT No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up... I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived. His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father was Mateo, not Vicente. \nStill thinking about what he has just heard, Diego places the breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of tea. Judit begins to drink it, one tiny sip at a time. \nDIEGO (Assimilates the news. He is not displeased) Does Mateo know? \nJUDIT No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I didn't want our relationship to change because of it. After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to become a father. \nThe pieces begin to fall together. \nDIEGO I see... \nJUDIT \n", "test3_true": "Diego remains pensive for a moment. \nDIEGO I will not recriminate you... I think I like being Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he called early this morning... \nJUDIT Who? \nDIEGO Mateo. At 8h. \nShe looks at the clock and it's 11h. \nJUDIT What did he want? \nDIEGO For you to call him as soon as you could. \nJUDIT (Surprised, tense) That I call him? Why in the world have you not awakened me?! \nDIEGO Because, after what happened last night, you needed to sleep. He didn't say it was urgent. You can call him now. \nJudit grabs her son's phone, agitated once again, and dials Mateo's number. \n173. ALTERNATING BETWEEN JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. \n174. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO JUNIOR'S STUDY. INT. \nDAY. 2008. \nIn the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where he is. All one can see is a bit of a curtain, out of focus. \nPhone conversation. \nJUDIT (Attempts to appear calm, since her confession her voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker) Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need anything? (This is what she's most worried about.) \nMATEO (Almost with irony) I am not alright, Judit. And yes, I do need something... The forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last film in order to edit it... I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just found out the material was destroyed in '94. I imagined something like this, I just didn't think it would have happened that soon... \nJUDIT (With urgency) Let me explain... \nMATEO (Cuts her off) No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit, and I don't want to take it out on you! \nJUDIT (Surprised and alarmed) What are you doing at Ernesto's house? \nThe shot opens up, and we discover Ernesto Junior at the other end of the room, next to a 16mm camera (on a tripod) recording everything that Mateo says and does, while he searches around in some drawers. \nMATEO I think I am going to bribe him. We need money, I don't want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to throw... \n175. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO'S STUDY. INT. DAY. 2008. \nThe studio has a different configuration than when his father lived, but we recognize the place nonetheless; when the father was alive the space served a different purpose. Ernesto looks at Mateo fearlessly, he is still determined to search, urgently, for something inside the drawers of a chest. The place is a pretty big mess. \nJUDIT Mateo, stop talking crazy! \nMATEO It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death. \nJUDIT My God! (She asks Diego to bring her the box of tranquilizers.) Wait a second... I have something to tell you. \nMATEO Let it be, you already said enough last night. \nJUDIT \n(She takes a pill and yells at him) Listen to me, Mateo! (As she raises her voice, she becomes dominant.) I was the production director, if you want to know anything about the footage, ask me! \nMATEO Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you have to tell me? \nJUDIT In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be destroyed. \nMATEO In '94! Very shortly after the release of that aberration. \nJUDIT Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material... and that was many years ago. \nMATEO That's not anything that I don't already know. \nJUDIT As the film's producer I was the only one who had access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home. \nMATEO You are lying to me. \nJUDIT I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes... Everything! You can have it whenever you want! \nThe silence on the other end of the line reassures her. \nMATEO That changes everything. \nJUDIT (Begs) Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto alone. He had nothing to do with this. \nMateo looks over at Ernesto Junior. The camera is still on its tripod, rolling. \nMATEO I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what he was doing in Lanzarote. I'll let you go, it seems he wants to talk... (Hangs up) \nErnesto, finally, finds a DVD. He has it in his hand and brings it toward Mateo. (His hand enters into view on the screen of the 16mm camera). \nERNESTO J. Here is a copy of \"the making of\". \nMATEO And why would I want that? I can't watch it! Plus, I'm not interested. \nErnesto takes his hand and places the DVD softly onto it. \n", "test3_id": 2402}

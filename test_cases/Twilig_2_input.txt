(with bloodlust) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces 
DR. CULLEN I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James. 
ROSALIE If he doesn't get to one of us first. 
BELLA 
(horrified) This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me. 
ROSALIE Too late. 
Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen 
EDWARD I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away 
DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you. 
ALICE I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south. 
(facing him) I'll keep her safe, Edward. 
Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 
EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself? 
She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to 
EDWARD Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 
ROSALIE 
(dropping the clothes) Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you've inflicted on us 
DR. CULLEN 
(spinning on her) Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's a part of this family now. And we protect our family. 
She glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars 
Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together. 
BELLA If any of you get hurt because of me 
EDWARD We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you. 
He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 
EDWARD You're my life now. 
They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME 
107 EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN 107 
The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame 
108 INT. MERCEDES - SAME 108 
Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone 
BELLA 
Mom, it's me again. You must have 
let your phone die. Anyway, I'm 
not in Forks anymore but I'm okay. 
I'll explain when you call. 
She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face - 
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 
-- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash by us. Finally, we land in.. 
109 OMITTED 109 
110 EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY 110 
TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead. 
Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone. 
111 OMITTED 111 
112 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - DAY 112 
Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the river. In the distance, below, they SEE 
THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue over the hill's crest.

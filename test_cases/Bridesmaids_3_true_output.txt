NICOLE Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last night. I tried calling you fifty fucking times. And YOU? You were what, hooking up with this fossil?! 
ANNIE First of all- 
NICOLE Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass bitch. 
ANNIE Ok, that is not nice. 
NICOLE And what are you forty? 
ANNIE No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass. 
NICOLE What did you say?! 
ANNIE (timid) You heard me. Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face. She's proud of herself. Nicole's two friends enter and jump on Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT. 
EXT. HOTEL RICK. FIVE MINUTES LATER. 
Annie is outside of the hotel. Guys are pulling the girls off of Annie. 
NICOLE Baker Community College bitch! 
The girls leave in victory. Dave turns and mouths to Annie âI'm sorry.â 
INT. ANNIE'S HOTEL BATHROOM. 
She frantically tries to cover up her HUGE hickey and evidence of the fight, with make-up. She remembers a small cowboy print tablecloth from the other room and wraps it around her neck like a scarf. 
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES. BUFFET TABLE 
All the girls are hung over and eating. Annie arrives. 
MEGAN Annie! 
LILLIAN Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo? 
ANNIE That's hilarious. 
MEGAN Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night last night. I met this guy named Darwin. He works for Cingular. He had a friend. 
LESLIE What happened to your face? 
LILLIAN Yeah, why are you wearing all that makeup? 
ANNIE It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey. I got into fight with a community college student and her friends because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire night trying to find you. 
LILLIAN What?! 
ANNIE Forget it. 
LILLIAN I was trying to find YOU. I tried to call you all night! 
ANNIE Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a minute? Annie takes Lillian away. 
LILLIAN What is going on? You told Helen you were sick. 
ANNIE I wasn't sick. Helen told you that because... I couldn't afford to go with you guys. 
LILLIAN Why didn't you say something?-- 
HELEN (O.S.) Lillian, we're going to be late for our honey facials. 
ANNIE Helen, can you just give us a minute? 
HELEN I'm just saying, we're gonna be late. I don't wanna be rude. 
ANNIE That's funny. You know what? As the Maid of honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just give us a minute. 
HELEN Excuse me Annie. 
ANNIE No, excuse me! 
LILLIAN Annie take it easy. 
ANNIE I need to take it easy? 
DANA Annie, if it makes you feel any better (getting emotional] I got slapped last night. 
LESLIE Here we go...

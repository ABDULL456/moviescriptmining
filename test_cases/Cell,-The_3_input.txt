TEDDY LEE Now? 
NOVAK Now. 
INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY 
A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view. 
TEDDY LEE Complete absence of melanin. 
Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder. 
RAMSEY And that means? 
Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch (chicken fried steak now carry-out). 
NOVAK The dog's an albino. (pictures it) He'd love an animal like that. 
TEDDY LEE Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed. 
INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Exiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her fingers hold a can of mace. 
INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT 
Julia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and checks her sideview mirror. 
Reflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering. 
JULIA Oh no... 
INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Julia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears to be in terrible pain. 
JULIA God... I didn't see you. 
STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car. 
STARGHER (feeds him a treat) Good boy. 
INT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY 
In a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak enters and through presence alone, lacking any self consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman. 
NOVAK Donna Krozin. (a new picture every time) Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki... 
The chatter dies. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace Cassatt... Anne Vicksey. 
Every person is solemn and focused. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) Smart, gentle, attractive young women. Just starting out in life. Embarking on careers, going to school, getting married... 
He's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly post-mortem photos. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.  By a white male.  About 30-years old. (significantly) Who owns an albino dog./ 
Everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is heightened.  Ramsey chimes in. 
RAMSEY A purebred German Shepherd.

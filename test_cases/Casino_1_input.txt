He exits. 
FRANKIE AVALON (O.S.) ...Well, I've got a large family. 
ACE (Into microphone) How many kids do you have? 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. 
ACE (Into microphone) Eight children! (He encourages the audience to applaud.) 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. 
ACE (Into microphone, to audience) That's amazing. 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) There was nothing to it. (Chuckles) It was my pleasure. 
INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
GREEN and ARTHUR CAPP are solemnly watching another episode of Ace's TV show with an elderly juggler guest. 
GREEN Ace, don't do it. 
ACE begins to juggle. 
GREEN Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus... he's juggling! 
The audience cheers him on. 
ACE (O.S.) (From next scene) Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously. 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACES HIGH - NIGHT 
WE MOVE PAST TWO TELEVISION CAMERAS TO ACE BEHIND HIS DESK AT ANOTHER TAPING OF HIS SHOW. TRUDY IS AT HIS SIDE. 
ACE (Into microphone) I recently challenged him to a debate on this program and he declined. What are you worried about, Pat? You don't have to send me any questions. You can ask me anything you want. 
STONE (O.S.) (From next scene) What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway? 
INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK HOME - DAY 
Vegas Sun newspaper front page photo of ACE on television. Headline reads: 'Rothstein Sues Gaming Commission'. 
STONE is sitting across from GAGGI at his office. 
STONE He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? (Chuckles.) He's out of his fuckin' mind. 
ACE (O.S.) (From next scene) It's a pity in this... 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACES HIGH - NIGHT 
ACE (Into microphone) ...state that we have such hypocrisy. Some people can do whatever they want. Other people have to pay through the nose. 
INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK HOME - DAY 
ACE (O.S.) (From previous scene) But such is life. 
GAGGI Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit. 
EXT. MIGHTY MART CONVENIENCE STORE, REAR PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
SHERBERT and ACE pull up beside another parked car. ACE gets out of his car in a robe and pajamas and gets into STONE's car. 
INT. STONE'S CAR - NIGHT 
ACE First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. 
STONE These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - 
ACE Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? 
STONE The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! 
ACE Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? 
STONE What do you propose? 
ACE I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? 
STONE They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. 
ACE All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. 
STONE I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. 
ACE (Sighs) I can't do that. 
ACE (V.O.) Of course... 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
JENNIFER is on the phone with GINGER; NICKY listens in. 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis. 
ACE (V.O.) ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car. 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? 
ACE (V.O.) Next morning bright and early, I get the call. 
GINGER (Over telephone) One o'clock? 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE listens in on GINGER's and JENNIFER's conversation. 
JENNIFER (Over telephone) Great. 
GINGER (Into telephone) You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go? 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) Well, you know... 
ACE (V.O.) But just getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes didn't work. So, we figured out another act. 
INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY 
A bored FBI man, seated at his desk with a tape recorder and headphones, looks at his wrist watch. 
ACE (V.O.) You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in... 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
ACE (V.O.) ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on... 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
ACE (V.O.) ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes. 
INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY 
GINGER (Over telephone) Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow. 
The FBI man clicks off the tape recorder. 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
NICKY (Into telephone) Meet me at three. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
ACE (Into telephone) What - what, Caesar's? 
NICKY (Over telephone) No, a... 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
NICKY (Into telephone) ...hundred yards further down the road. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE (Into telephone) Why? 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
NICKY (Into telephone) Don't ask questions. Just be there. 
NICKY gives the phone back to JENNIFER. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE gives the phone to GINGER. 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN 
NICKY (To himself) Always asking questions. 
He exits. 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) Suzy Creamcheese has the exact... 
INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY 
The bored FBI agent clicks on again and hears GINGER and JENNIFER's inane conversation. 
JENNIFER (Over telephone) ...same outfit. 
GINGER (Chuckles, over telephone) But I saw something... 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
GINGER (Into telephone) ...something very... cute. 
ACE sits down on the couch behind her and lights a cigarette.

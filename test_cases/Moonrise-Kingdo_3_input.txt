SUZY I wish I knew what makes you tick. 
MR. BISHOP (HESITATES) I beg your pardon? 
MRS. BISHOP Please, terminate this conversation. 
MR. BISHOP (TO LIONEL) She's saying that to me? 
Lionel shakes his head bitterly. Suzy stares out to sea. Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door, and goes inside. 
INT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY 
A small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly, pausing between each sentence: 
SCOUT MASTER WARD I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your situation. It's not on the register. How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time for an inspection back there. On the beach. I would've given you a "commendable". That was one of the best- pitched camp-sites I've ever seen. Honestly. 
Sam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded VOICE: 
SCOUT MASTER WARD You don't want to be a Khaki Scout anymore? 
Sam shakes his head. 
INT. POST OFFICE. DAY 
Becky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on. Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing their own sets of head-phones. There is a click on the other end of the line. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) Hello, Becky. 
BECKY Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) Go ahead, New Penzance. 
CUT TO: 
Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss- cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor behind her. 
CAPTAIN SHARP Hello? This is Captain Sharp. 
Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball- point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She says into her telephone: 
SOCIAL SERVICES Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody. 
CAPTAIN SHARP That's correct. 
SOCIAL SERVICES What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind? 
CAPTAIN SHARP He's OK. 
SOCIAL SERVICES Very good. How do I get to you? 
CAPTAIN SHARP The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail. 
SOCIAL SERVICES I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to (MORE) 
SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd) provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time? 
CAPTAIN SHARP Uh-huh. 
SOCIAL SERVICES Is that a yes? 
CAPTAIN SHARP Uh-huh. 
SOCIAL SERVICES Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day. 
Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain Sharp says abruptly: 
CAPTAIN SHARP Wait a second. 
SOCIAL SERVICES (HESITATES) Yes? 
CAPTAIN SHARP Social Services? 
SOCIAL SERVICES (EVENLY) Captain Sharp.

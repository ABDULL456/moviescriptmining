The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS. 
KIROV Jesus Christ... 
THE MYSTERIOUS PEAK 
Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left to right in front of them. 
THE ASTRONAUTS 
Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low, staccato tone intruding over their headsets. 
LUKE Anyone else hear that? 
COTE Yeah. What is it? 
WILLIS Sounds like our antenna's out of phase. 
LUKE Can you fix it? 
WILLIS Hey, skip, I can fix anything. 
LUKE Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's break out the radar, see what this thing's made of. 
As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling tone continues. 
INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY 
MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, look as excited as schoolkids. 
BECK ...and this is the Mars Mission Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I understand a comm packet is incoming from Mars One Base Camp, so you may find this interesting. 
He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside. 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously. 
AMBASSADOR That man over there. He's in charge? 
BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO 
MCCONNELL 
Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart, like so many eager bees. 
BECK 
Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding. 
BECK No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the astronauts? Jim's been with the manned Mars program since its inception. One of our real pioneers. 
AMBASSADOR Will he be going to Mars, too? 
BECK Ah, no. This is as close as he gets. 
ON THE SCREEN 
Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing away their dishes and leftovers. 
LUKE ...anyway, that's about it. We'll send another packet when we get back. 
Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can barely conceal their grins. 
LUKE Oh, right. One more thing. Today is a very special day for a good friend of ours, and I know he's there right now. 
McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to? 
LUKE Now, he hates it when any fuss is made, so I won't mention his name... 
A look of relief comes over McConnell. 
LUKE ...because the last thing in the world I'd ever want to do is embarrass someone like Jim McConnell. 
McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING "Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key. 
LUKE C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing! 
Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified. 
LUKE (sings a line, then, to CAMERA:) Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he all red with one of those fake "I'm- a-good-sport" grins? 
Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin. 
LUKE And hey, you guys, check out Ray! Does he have on one of his "This- wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces? 
Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving. 
LUKE Nothing you can do about it, Ray! We're a hundred million miles away! 
Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the cupcake in a toast. 
LUKE Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish! 
He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and applaud, then wave goodbye. 
LUKE Catch you again soon. Take care, buddy. End of transmission. 
Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen GOES BLACK.

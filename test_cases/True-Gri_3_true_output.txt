He ducks his head as best he can to avoid the claws but that is the extent of his reaction. 
Rooster Put your arms around my neck, I will carry. 
He presents his back and she relents, clasping her arms. He rises with a pained wheeze and he starts jogging with Mattie piggie-back. 
Bouncing at his shoulder, she twists to look back. 
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller. 
Mattie turns forward again, eyes drooping. 
LATER 
Rooster is loudly wheezing as he carries Mattie before him now, his jog slowed to an unsteady walk. Her eyes are opening again. 
They are now on a proper dirt road. Rooster staggers around a turn and does a barely controlled stumble to his knees, and then sits heavily back, Mattie in his lap. 
Up ahead is the front porch of Bagby's store, the building dark. 
Rooster sits gasping. 
Mattie's voice is thick: 
Mattie Where are we? 
Rooster takes out his gun, weakly raises his arm, and fires into the air. He sits panting. 
Rooster I have grown old. 
The door of the distant store opens and someone emerges, holding a lamp, peering out into the dark. 
FADE OUT 
TRAIN 
We are looking into the window of a moving train. Looking out past us is a thin forty- year-old woman. 
Reflected in the window is a sizable railyard and then, as the train slows, a station. Reading backward in the mirror of the window is the station stop: MEMPHIS. 
We hear the voice, familiar from the opening of the movie, of the grown Mattie Ross: 
Voice-Over A quarter of a century is a long time. 
TRAIN DOOR 
As the train eases to a stop the woman, Mattie, steps down. One sleeve of her dress is pinned up. 
Voice-Over I had written a letter of thanks to Marshal Cogburn, with an invitation to visit, along with the fifty dollars I owed him. In his reply he promised he would try to call next time he came to Fort Smith with prisoners. Brief though his note was, it was rife with misspellings. 
Mattie goes along the platform, holding a small bag in one hand and, crushed against its handle, a flier. 
. . . The marshal did not visit, nor did he communicate further. I had not been conscious during his leavetaking: by the time Bagby rode us to Fort Smith my hand had turned black. I was not awake when I lost the arm. I later learned that Mr. LeBoeuf recovered fully. When the marshals found him he was searching the pines below the rock ledge for Tom Chaney's body. He found it and took it back to San Saba for the reward. It was well earned. 
In the scene, Mattie calls peremptorily to a young boy on the platform: 
Mattie Boy. 
She shows him the flier: 
The Cole Younger and Frank James Wild West Show Riding! Shooting! Lariat "Tricks" ! Don't Leave the Ladies and the Little Ones Behind! Also Featuring Rooster Cogburn! He will amaze you with his skill and dash! Memphis Fairgrounds July 18, 1908 
The boy looks up and points. 
Mattie crosses the platform and further along, descends to the railyard. 
The cars of the Wild West Show are parked along a siding. They display gaudily painted scenes of men on rearing horses firing six-guns, of conestoga wagons, war-bonneted Indians, bandana-wearing bad men. Three featured performers have their own vignetted scenes, each depicted as a youngish man engaged in Wild West hell-raising, each with his name painted beneath: Cole Younger, Frank James, and (unrecognizable but for the eyepatch) Rooster Cogburn. Below Rooster's name is the sublegend "He rode with Quantrill! He rode for Parker!" 
Around the rail cars cowboys--and some Indians--mill, more wobegone than their painted representations. 
Mattie asks someone along the way for directions and is pointed toward the rear of the train. 
Voice-Over Little Frank had sent me the flier. He had chaffed me through the years over the fact that I had not married, calling the marshal my "secret sweetheart," and he sent a note with the advertisement: "Skill and dash--it's not too late, Mattie!" Little Frank and Victoria have always liked jokes and they are all right in their place. I have never held it against either one of them for leaving me at home to look after Mama, and they know it, for I have told them. 
Mattie speaks to two men who sit on the rear platform of the rear car. They are old men drinking Coca-Colas. One doffs his hat and rises when Mattie addresses the pair; the other stays seated, slurping from his bottle. 
Standing Man Yes'm, I am Cole Younger. This is Mr. James. It grieves me to tell you that you have missed Rooster. He passed away, what, three days ago, when the show was in Jonesboro Arkansas. Buried him there in the confederate cemetery. Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss" and I believe the warm weather was too much for him. We had some lively times. What was the nature of your acquaintance? 
Mattie I knew the marshal long ago. We too had lively times. Thank you, Mr. Younger.

Someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk (MURNAU).  His hand holds out a small vial.  The Laughing Man grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously. 
MURNAU I assume you're wondering ... what all this has been about. 
Kafka tries to see into the shadows. 
KAFKA Are you the Head of Medical Records? 
The door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat (EKMAN) comes in.  He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka. 
MURNAU (to Ekman) He's come on his own initiative. (to Kafka) -- Not something we encourage, mind you, but we like to know it exists. 
And he's stood up. 
MURNAU What it amounts to is simply this ... 
He's coming around the desk.  He's drying his hands on a towel. 
MURNAU A piece of paper was delivered to the wrong clerk.  It was essential he bring it back to us.  These complications have arisen because he had friends -- like you, among others -- friends unlikely to let a sleeping dog lie. 
He tosses the towel onto the desk.  Ekman looks irritated by this. 
KAFKA ... A piece of paper ... 
MURNAU A mere slip. (coming forward) Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came in, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct? 
He places a fatherly hand on Kafka's shoulder. 
MURNAU (not quite in the light yet) Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one. 
KAFKA (again) ... A piece of paper ... 
MURNAU (face bending into the light) You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority. 
And he's an impressive, imposing figure of authority himself.  You'd probably trust him.  You'd certainly respect him.  But if you look into his eyes, he's frightening. 
CUT: 
UNDERGROUND CRYPTS 
Mr. Pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him.  Fires his gun back at them, dropping one or two -- but then runs out of bullets. 
The prisoners slowly surround him.  He backs away.  One of those chains that run throughout the Castle has its base here.  Mr. Pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain-system. 
Caught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the ceiling.  The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does not, could not, ever stop.  Instead it forces Mr. Pick to go along with it, his head CRACKING through the glass or wood "manhole" cover through which the chain passes. 
CUT: 
MURNAU'S OFFICE 
Kafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly figure. 
MURNAU -- You seem amused. 
KAFKA It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being. 
Ekman sighs -- as if at a difficult child. 
MURNAU It's merely a matter of expediency.  It's imperative that my room to maneuver not be hindered by ... bureaucratic ramifications. 
Ekman, who doesn't hear very well, directs one ear in particular back and forth between the other two.  Kafka just keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him -- who's now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that was in the ashtray at the lab. 
MURNAU -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency. 
KAFKA (becoming clearer) "Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. 
MURNAU (to Ekman) I believe we've exceeded his expectations. 
KAFKA (virtually to himself) I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see. (looks up) And I find you.  A body snatcher.

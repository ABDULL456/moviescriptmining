Everyone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the Northside guys but sits with his own. 
INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on him" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in. 
ROMEO These dagos are getting antsy and I'm getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there! 
CONNOR Stick it out. Waitin' on one more. 
EXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a "closed for private function" sign on the door. 
INT. JACKED UP SUV, NEARBY -- SAME TIME 
Crew Cut watches Jo Jo.   He dials his cell. 
INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
From behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing phone, nearby. We do not see his face. 
INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER 
The following conversation is in Italian. 
CREW CUT He is not with them. 
OLD MAN Are you certain? 
CREW CUT Yes. It is only the sons. They have a Spaniard with them. They will slaughter everyone. 
OLD MAN Let them. If you kill the sons...the father will come. 
Crew Cut develops a sinister smile. 
INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is angrily cooking up a storm. 
CONNOR The gang's all here. 
Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink. He stands fuming with his hands on his hips. 
ROMEO Gimme my fucking bee bee gun. 
MURPHY Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome. 
Murphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles. 
INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
JO JO So....where's Gorgeous? 
Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back. Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward. 
N.S. BRUGLIONE #2 What the fuck is going on, here? 
S.S. BRUGLIONE #2 Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe! Where you at?! 
As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back... 
S.S. BRUGLIONE #3 "Erin go brah?" What the hell does that mean? Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them. 
MURPHY It's Irish for "You're fucked." 
Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music. 
Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to. 
Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the salad bar. 
Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode. Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth. 
The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts. 
ROMEO Viva La Mejico, bitches! 
George bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly. 
GEORGE Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have really turned me around on this! I'm like born again and shit! I swear! 
MURPHY (to Connor) What do ya think? Let him go? 
Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest.

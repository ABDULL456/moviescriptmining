253	INT.  COCKPIT  FEDERATED  WARSHIP 
COMMANDER It's not only advancing, but it's moving at incredible speed! We're having trouble following it. 
254	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
PRESIDENT (to Scientist) ...And... Do you have any idea where it's heading? 
The scientist is hard to put to answer, he shakes his head. 
255	INT.  ZFX200  COCKPIT - NIGHT 
Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a little. 
KORBEN (gentle, loving) Apipoulai.. 
Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish. 
LEELOO I'm so very sad. 
KORBEN Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say? 
LEELOO Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... 
KORBEN I told you not to read all that crap! 
LEELOO Protect life... Until death. 
Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems so depressed.  Cornelius enters. 
CORNELIUS There's a General on the phone... His name's Mambo, I think. 
256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
MUNRO Munro here. President Lindberg wants to talk to you.  Hold the line. 
The President clears his throat and takes the phone. 
PRESIDENT Major, first off, I want to thank you, in my name and in the name of the Federation... 
257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
PRESIDENT (O.S.) For the praiseworthy courage you have shown us! I'd like to congratulate General Munro for his choice. He found the ideal man for such a... 
KORBEN (to the point) So now what's the problem? 
The President drops into his armchair and sighs. 
PRESIDENT There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth. And we have no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem. 
Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on board. 
KORBEN How much time before the collision? 
The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head. 
SCIENTIST If its speed remains constant... in an hour and 57 minutes. 
KORBEN (O.S.) I'll call you back in two hours. 
Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned. 
258	EXT.  SPACE 
The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded cosmos. 
259	INT.  CHAPEL 
David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of... 
260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN 
The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert. 
Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with him. Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the chapel. 
DAVID You're all safe. Thanks be to God! 
CORNELIUS Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose! 
The small group enters the chapel. 
261	INT.  CHAPEL 
Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross. 
KORBEN Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray later? 
Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off lowering the altar like a service elevator. 
The altar descends amid rocky walls. 
262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
MUNRO They just landed in the desert. 
PRESIDENT (sweating) How much time is left?

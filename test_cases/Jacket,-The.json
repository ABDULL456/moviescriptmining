{"test1_input": "Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye. \nMACKENZIE Hey...when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. [Beat] They don't eat you when there's music playing. \nSTARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away -- dead arm in tow. \nDR. LORENSON So you're ok? \nSTARKS [Still distracted] What? \nDR. LORENSON I asked you if you're ok. \nSTARKS [Suspiciously] I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You think there's anything wrong with me? \nDR. LORENSON I don't know. You're not my patient. \nSTARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over. \nDR. LORENSON You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating? \nSTARKS I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams. \nSTARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare. \nSTARKS You done with your small talk? \nDR. LORENSON Sure. \nSTARKS Good. \nSTARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't escape LORENSON's observation. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAY \nSTARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them, when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock. \nThe sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink. \nDAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out. \nDAMON I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen you coming there. \nSTARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now. \nDAMON [Leaning down close to him] Were you worried about me? [Smiling] That's so sweet. Thanks. \nWith that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nSTARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the night interrupted by first faint, then approaching, FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until DAMON and HARDING enter his room. \nThey pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them one. \nNURSE HARDING You gonna get the fuck up? \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nSTARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE \nThey're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET... \nBECKER I'm glad to see you're cooperating this time, Mr. Starks. \nSTARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them. They might even knock someone out... \nDAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that it's all right. \nDAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps on one of Starks' bare feet. \nSTARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and HARDING leap to restrain Starks. \nBECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the floor.   BECKER puts them on. \nDR. GRIES Hold him while I get the tranquilizer. \nDAMON Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot. \nDAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down. \nBECKER No. That's not necessary. \nBECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor. He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at the force he just used. \nBECKER Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let him go! \nAs soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER -- pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what he's capable of doing... \n", "test1_true": "BECKER [An inch away from his face] What, Starks? What are you going to do? End me just because I'm an inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just like you did with Officer Harrison? \nSTARKS' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a look of self-doubt crosses his face. \nBECKER The only thing your mind is missing is a conscience. \nSTARKS lets go of him and, as soon as he does, DAMON and HARDING restrain him. BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD from his face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out. \nDR. GRIES Wait...Dr. Becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for? \nBECKER doesn't answer. He doesn't even turn around. DR. GRIES goes after him. \nDR. GRIES Just strap him in for now. \nAnd DAMON and HARDING start to... \nINT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE, SOME TIME \nLATER \nBECKER turns around from the window and we see that his cheek is BANDAGED. He opens a drawer, takes out some SCOTCH and pours himself a SHOT. He swallows some pills with it. \nAfter he drinks it, he looks up to see GRIES standing opposite him, watching. \nDR. GRIES You ok? \nBECKER I'm fine. \nDR. GRIES [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you... \nBECKER Then don't. \nDR. GRIES But... what about Starks? \nBECKER What about Starks? \nDR. GRIES Should we be... \nBECKER Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes. \nDR. GRIES But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that? BECKER [As if stunned by the question] Leaving him in? [Beat] The medication I'm given him is intended to adjust -- maybe even reset -- his violent proclivities. You know, peel away some of those layers of hate. The Jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen. The grounds and the halls -- where I can't monitor side effects I can't predict -- aren't. \nDR. GRIES [Still doubtful] But, but...what about... \nBECKER [Mocking Gries] But...but what about the gun? I mean, should he have been firing away like that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up. [Turning away] There, there's the insurance you're looking for. \nDR. GRIES I'm not looking for anything. \nBECKER shakes his head, laughing inside at the world's stupidity. \nBECKER [Beat] It's Christmas Eve, Justin. Don't you have somewhere to be? \nBECKER doesn't wait for an answer, just turns back towards the window and takes another sip of his drink. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE \nNURSE HARDING turns on the television as DAMON sits in one of the lounge chairs. \nNURSE HARDING Ah, man, look, It's A Wonderful Life. \nDAMON You got any booze? \nHARDING takes out a FLASK from her BACKPACK. \nNURSE HARDING 'Course I do. [Smiling] And it is the season for giving so let's get to it. \nDAMON smiles and rubs his hands together eagerly. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE \nA shot of the WALL OF DRAWERS, with no one in the room, just someone in the wall... \nINT. CADAVER DRAWER \nSTARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place once more. But nothing happens for some seconds. He breathes anxiously, not knowing what to expect. His heart beats steadily: THUMP...THUMP, until, finally, with each beat, a SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecks...then, two dots...then, two circles...then, the WHITES of a pair of EYES with a terrific meanness in them. \nThe EYES blink, then disappear like they were never there. \nThe pace of STARKS' heart quickens, and the inexplicable madness surrounds him once more... \nEXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK \nThe SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but he's in the middle of the murder scene, watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the floor. He turns to look over his shoulder and sees... \nEXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT \nThrough a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA, we see FIRE, FLESH, and RUIN littering the sand. Slowly the terrifying images shift to a naturalistic, real-time documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring. \n", "test1_id": 1779, "test2_input": "STARKS The Jacket. \nMACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it. \nMACKENZIE Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think... \nSTARKS No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days. \nJust then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks towards them. \nHARDING What are you two yappin' about? \nSTARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this point. \nMACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut] [Beat] We're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future. [To Starks] That is what we're talking about here, right? \nSTARKS is startled MacKenzie gets it. \nSTARKS Yeah, it is. \nHARDING You know something? You're two fucking freaks is what you are. \nSTARKS [Smiling] Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you think we're doing in this place? \nMACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out. \nHARDING I want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food. \nHARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns. \nSTARKS [Under his breath] I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie. \nMACKENZIE It's gonna be sticky. \nSTARKS Why? \nMACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in its sudden jerks accompanying every word. \nMACKENZIE 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! \nSTARKS So what am I supposed to do? \nMACKENZIE You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something. \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY \nDr. LORENSON and DR. GRIES are walking briskly to a meeting. \nDR. GRIES We're late. \nLORENSON I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have. \nDR. GRIES Maybe it's not such a waste. \nLORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record straight. \nLORENSON It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about. \nDR. GRIES They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for. \nLORENSON can see GRIES is trying to tell her something. \nLORENSON What should they be looking for? \nDR. GRIES They should just be looking harder. \nLORENSON grabs GRIES' arm, sensing the import of her words. \nLORENSON Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he? \nDR. GRIES Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now. \nINT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY \nSTARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around -- presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young, fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY, administering medication from a dated CART. \nSTARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her. \nThe BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as the BRUTE reaches the NURSE. \nHe throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it. \nThe BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he understands pain. \nSTARKS [To Sally] You ok? \nAs she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes perilously close to STARKS' head. \nThe BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified. Is this when he dies? \n", "test2_true": "SALLY Are you ok? \nSTARKS Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone? Where is everyone? \nSALLY [Defensively] There's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. But I've been alone before... \nSTARKS Where are the other orderlies? \nSALLY In the therapy session downstairs. That's what the rep's sitting in on... \nSTARKS Ok, listen. I want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you. I'll go get some doctors. \nSALLY looks at STARKS, wondering whether she can trust him. Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers that she can. \nINT. MAIN ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992 \nThe STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF (Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters... \nSTARKS [Calling out] Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker. \nBECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response. \nBECKER Mr. Starks, this session is for our civil patients. Damon, please take Mr. Starks back to his ward. STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze. \nSTARKS [Derisively] No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap me in a Jacket or even gag me, but please don't leave me out of therapy. This is where I feel like I make the most progress. \nBECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less. \nBECKER Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a chair for yourself. \nAs STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down. \nBECKER Mr. Jensen, please continue. \nJENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's about to... \nJENSEN Well, [beat] I've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization. \nBECKER's not listening to a word JENSEN says. But STARKS is. \nBECKER [Calm as ever] And what have they approached you about, Mr. Jensen? \nJENSEN They want me to head the Organization for the Organized. \nThe other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE REP listens limply. \nBECKER The Organization...for the Organized? \nJENSEN That's right. Have you heard of them? \nBECKER No, Mr. Jensen. I have not. \nGROUP PATIENT 2 That's because there is no such Organization, you idiot. \nJENSEN That is categorically not true. Bl-bl- blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE. I've been asked to lead them. But, if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush-hush, would they? \nBECKER [Wearily] What do the rest of you think? \nThe GROUP stares at one another silently. \nSTARKS [Loud and emphatic] Well, [beat] I know they exist. \nBECKER And how is that? \nSTARKS looks at JENSEN, who looks back avidly. MACKENZIE eyes Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do. \nSTARKS When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized. \nBECKER [Incensed] Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr. Jensen. \nSTARKS [Looking right at Jensen] It is a fact. Bona fide, and classified. \nLORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously. \nJENSEN I knew it! I knew it! Those little fuckers are everywhere. \nSTARKS They recruit only the best, Mr. Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have to say this... \nNot even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence... \nSTARKS But these people [pointing to the Doctors] know about it. In fact, when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to Alpine Grove. They're among us right now! [Looking right at Becker] Isn't that right, Dr. Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they picked you. \nJENSEN looks on nobly. \nSTARKS They're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm? \nSTARKS suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut. \nSTARKS [Looking suddenly directly at Becker] All they do is give orders. That's all they have to do. And no one will ever know. All it comes down to is an order. [Beat] They've got hands everywhere. \n", "test2_id": 1780, "test3_input": "STARKS stands up, ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen. The OBSERVERS look to BECKER for order. \nSTARKS Long live the Organization for the Organized! \nBECKER Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks! \nBut, at that, Jensen's completely lost it. His excitement erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF in the head. \nBECKER Sit down, Mr. Jensen! \nToo late. OTHER PATIENTS are on their feet, HANDS jubilantly up in the air. And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless order is soundly delivered in Becker's NOD to Damon. \nRANDOM PATIENTS Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker! \nDAMON and HARDING grab STARKS while the other members of the STAFF slowly calm the other patients. LORENSON is too busy to notice them taking Starks out. STARKS winks at MACKENZIE, who smiles somewhat sadly back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992 \nHARDING and DAMON stand above Starks, who lies on the brutal slab, already hemmed in the Jacket. \nDAMON Starks, you're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. \nDAMON slams him in the drawer. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nSTARKS' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in there with him. The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of nowhere, a DROP falls on his eye. PING! STARKS winces. He clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall. His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by the DRIPS -- making a score fit only for hell. He closes his eyes and begins to die... \nEXT. CRIME SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK, 1992 \nSTARKS and TENNY -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in silence in TENNY'S CAR. (We recognize the murder scene.) RED POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS doesn't see them yet. \nSTARKS and TENNY are talking to one another. TENNY's voice takes a dangerous tone. \nTENNY You ever been to jail? \nSTARKS No. \nTENNY nods, distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the GUN he's hidden there. \nTENNY It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been. \nSTARKS I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it... \nTENNY carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured and cautious with each word, each move. \nTENNY Well, I've never been to war, but I'm sure as hell not going back to prison. \nSTARKS [Finally spotting Harrison] What's he pulling us over for? \nTENNY [Still preparing himself] Recreation. \nOFFICER HARRISON walks up to their car. \nOFFICER HARRISON Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car, with your hands at your side please. \nSTARKS Why? \nOFFICER HARRISON [Sternly] Step out of the car. \nSTARKS Ok, sir. I was just asking what for. \nOFFICER HARRISON This is a stolen vehicle you're driving. Now put your hands in the air, out where I can see 'em. \nThat's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of the car to check on him. \nSTARKS Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for? \nTENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows, assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS. \nTENNY Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you ain't even worth a fucking bullet. \nTENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES \nTHE HIT. \nSTARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET... \nSTARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out, looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground, as he did in the scene before. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nSTARKS stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's back in there. Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN'S FOREHEAD that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the LIGHT gradually dims... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2004 \n", "test3_true": "She drops off her orders and then walks up to him. \nJACKIE I'll be off in 15 minutes. Can you wait till then? \nEXT. RAVINE, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 \nSTARKS and JACKIE smoke in the cold, standing next to the hood of her car. \nJACKIE The Jacket. That's what they call it, right? \nSTARKS Yeah. \nJACKIE It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients... \nSTARKS [Starting to make sense] So he was giving me all kinds of drugs... \nJACKIE [Nodding] Apparently. He was taking a lot of them, too. It said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the 70s -- \"womb treatment\" is the name he gave to what he did to you... \nSTARKS [Cutting in] Womb? A fuckin' womb? What kind of animal did he come out of? \nJACKIE But no one knew until after... \nSTARKS After I... \nJACKIE nods. \nJACKIE [Beat] You bled to death. \nSTARKS What? \nJACKIE I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it. \nSTARKS [Digesting] And you're sure my body was found on January 1st? JACKIE nods. \nSTARKS Do you really believe me? \nJACKIE I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was... \nJACKIE looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety is obvious. STARKS takes hold of her and holds her face close to his so that their foreheads touch. \nJACKIE [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? \nSTARKS Yes. \nJACKIE Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do. \nSTARKS I know. \nJACKIE Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. \nSTARKS If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? \nJACKIE looks at him and laughs. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY \nThey are driving through VERMONT to ALPINE GROVE. STARKS looks out the window and watches her drive. \nSTARKS I didn't kill Officer Harrison. \nJACKIE I know. \nSTARKS How? Did they figure it out after I died? \nJACKIE No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them. \nINT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004 \nSTARKS and JACKIE sit opposite DR. MORGAN, the current young face of the hospital. MORGAN has a boyish face and a matching gullibility. \nDR. MORGAN I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then. \nSTARKS His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died? \nDR. MORGAN No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more. \nSTARKS What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think. \nDR. MORGAN Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you. \nSTARKS What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries? \nDR. MORGAN Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago. \nJACKIE Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker? \nDR. MORGAN Your father was here 12 years ago. I doubt the hospital would have that, if Dr. Becker is still even alive. [Beat, a little suspiciously] Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died? \nSTARKS doesn't waver when he answers. \n", "test3_id": 1781}

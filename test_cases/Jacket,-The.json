{"train": "JACKIE You're just gonna walk? \nSTARKS Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel. \nSTARKS' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags. \nJACKIE What're those? \nSTARKS Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. \nJACKIE What for? \nSTARKS [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. \nJACKIE [Still looking at them] Hm. \nSTARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them. \nSTARKS I think I can remember what's on them. \nJACKIE William Starks. [Beat] Thanks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT \nSTARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic BLACKNESS about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE questions him. \nVOICE (O.S.) \"Jackie\" and \"Jean\" are the only ...things you know for certain about that day? \nSTARKS nods. \nVOICE (O.S.) Are you aware we have no last name, no place of residence, and no record of any physical presence for these \"friends\" of yours? How's that possible in this day and age? \nSTARKS nods as a muffled \"Objection\" flickers away in the background... \nVOICE (O.S.) I may need to actually hear that answer, Mr. Starks. \nSTARKS [Beat] Yes. With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS' OWN TRIAL. The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on... \nINT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT \nThere are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR. HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and confusingly -- just like it appears to himself. \nOFFICER NASH [Emotional] Eddie [correcting himself], Officer Harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood -- on his back. \nDR. HALE William Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this. \nOFFICER NASH [Cont'd] Officer Harrison'd been shot three times. He was long dead by the time we got there. \nDR. HALE I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome. The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it. \nPROSECUTION Gulf War   Syndrome? What the...Why don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome   while we're at it? I've gotten a   lot of convictions we could overturn   with that logic... \nCAPTAIN MEDLEY Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart. That award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It applauds honor. \nDR. HALE [Cont'd] His subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the Gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then. \nThe following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony. \nPROSECUTION [Disdainfully] It's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! He absolutely was. Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. \nCAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed] War isn't a CNN Special. Half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline -- either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. It was ugly. And they don't put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks] If Starks did kill that officer ... [Beat] You can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind. \nDEFENSE For God's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once. He doesn't know what's going on. \nFLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK \nSTARKS lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by OFFICER HARRISON'S dead, bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind. We hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment... \nSTARKS [V.O., nearly whispered] I don't know how it happened. STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness. \nINT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT \nThe JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the verdict. \nJURY FOREMAN On the count of first degree murder, we find the defendant, William Starks, not guilty by reason of insanity. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY \nIn his mind, STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun sets and bounces off the snow all around him. We see JACKIE watching him walk away into the woods. \nJUDGE (O.S.) I hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane, where I hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you... \nINT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT \nThe JUDGE sentences STARKS, who stares back vacantly, like a man who checked out of his life long before this judge decided he had to. \nSTARKS [Forced to yell] Will you listen to me? I'm not going to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean to bump...I'm sorry. \nORDERLIES and NURSES, followed by DR. BECKER, surround them now, violently pulling STARKS off the patient. BECKER, familiar with the PATIENT (HAROLD), tries to calm him. \nBECKER It's ok, Harold. It's ok. \nSTARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker's as they restrain him and give him more drugs. \nSTARKS [To Becker] I don't belong here... \nBECKER [Angrily, to the ORDERLIES] Get him to his room. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT \nSTARKS is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer and closer... \nWhat follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react. \nDR. GRIES, NURSE HARDING AND DAMON -- enter Starks' room. They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and a GAG. \nSTARKS has no idea what's happening to him as they drag him out, and his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either. \nNURSE HARDING Come on, army boy. Time for some therapy. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT \nThe first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR. GRIES and DAMON. \nA shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly- stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN. \nSTARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement. Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks, sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them. \nSTARKS Wait. Wait a minute... Please. \nBECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks, trying to bring the faces above him into focus... \nSTARKS I, I don't belong here. \nBECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back. \nBECKER No. I don't think you do either. [Beat] But neither of us can do anything about that. BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably about Starks' treatment. \nA CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS, already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside. \nThe ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall. \nINT. CADAVER DRAWER \nSTARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath. They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body. The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle. \nWe see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death. \nCombing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger... \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nIt's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern before they change into something else. Only after STARKS blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time between BLINKS. \n1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it, spilling from... \n2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH... \n3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him. \nBLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes... \n1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes from... \n2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one... \n3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead, content to be one of them. \nThe only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART pumping so fast it could be a drum... \nThe screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes shut. \nINT. CADAVER DRAWER \nJust then, as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to VIBRATE, something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the drawer. PING! Right on his eye. The drop of WATER is enough to send this man right over the edge. \nSTARKS' EYES roll back into his head and start to flutter, shaking the SCREEN right along them until... \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE \nSTARKS stands outside his body, looking at the wall of drawers he is in. He bends down to look more closely at a STAIN on the floor -- DRIED BLOOD -- and as he runs his HAND over it and stands back up, he is back in the... \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nJust before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye. \nMACKENZIE Hey...when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. [Beat] They don't eat you when there's music playing. \nSTARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away -- dead arm in tow. \nDR. LORENSON So you're ok? \nSTARKS [Still distracted] What? \nDR. LORENSON I asked you if you're ok. \nSTARKS [Suspiciously] I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You think there's anything wrong with me? \nDR. LORENSON I don't know. You're not my patient. \nSTARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over. \nDR. LORENSON You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating? \nSTARKS I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams. \nSTARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare. \nSTARKS You done with your small talk? \nDR. LORENSON Sure. \nSTARKS Good. \nSTARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't escape LORENSON's observation. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAY \nSTARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them, when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock. \nThe sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink. \nDAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out. \nDAMON I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen you coming there. \nSTARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now. \nDAMON [Leaning down close to him] Were you worried about me? [Smiling] That's so sweet. Thanks. \nWith that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nSTARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the night interrupted by first faint, then approaching, FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until DAMON and HARDING enter his room. \nThey pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them one. \nNURSE HARDING You gonna get the fuck up? \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nSTARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE \nThey're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET... \nBECKER I'm glad to see you're cooperating this time, Mr. Starks. \nSTARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them. They might even knock someone out... \nDAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that it's all right. \nDAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps on one of Starks' bare feet. \nSTARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and HARDING leap to restrain Starks. \nBECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the floor.   BECKER puts them on. \nDR. GRIES Hold him while I get the tranquilizer. \nDAMON Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot. \nDAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down. \nBECKER No. That's not necessary. \nBECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor. He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at the force he just used. \nBECKER Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let him go! \nAs soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER -- pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what he's capable of doing... \nAs STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a counseling voice... \nMACKENZIE (O.S.) When they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. \nThe TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away. \nMACKENZIE (O.S.) They don't eat you when there's music playing. \nThe scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him. \n1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK and a small child's HAND \n2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME) \n3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH \n4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water, not too deep... \n5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH \n6) EXT. DESERT, IRAQ: A sublime sunset... \nSTARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES. They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand. \nSTARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold of the moment with this simple gesture. \nThe whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nThe WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time -- emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is remarkably pretty. \nFrom her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there. STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is that she's tired. \nShe spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to hide any indication that she is. \nINT. WAITRESS' CAR \nShe gets in her old car and starts it. As it warms up, she looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees he's still there. \nHe starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car. \nEXT. PARKING LOT, DINER, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE \nThe WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS. \nWAITRESS Where do you think you're going? \nSTARKS looks at her. He doesn't know anymore than she does. \nWAITRESS You gonna answer me? \nSTARKS just stares. \nWAITRESS If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today. \nSTARKS [Beat] I'm not deaf. \nWAITRESS Good. \nShe turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut. She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her. \nAfter a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS. \nEXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, SOME SECONDS LATER \nShe comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs at Starks. \nWAITRESS [As if she owes him an explanation] I forgot my purse. \nSTARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't look like he belongs there. \nShe reverses towards him. \nWAITRESS In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here. \nSTARKS [Beat] Thanks. \nShe looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel. \nWAITRESS All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister? \nSTARKS I'm not sure. \nWAITRESS Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options. \nBeing cold and freezing are his options. \nWAITRESS Shit! That was one of my good glasses! \nAs she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She takes a long SIP. \nWAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken] Hey, you ok? \nSTARKS [Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. \nWAITRESS You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch. \nAnd sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back -- her EYES even more tired from the liquor. \nSTARKS I'm not gonna hurt you. \nWAITRESS [Softly] I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm gonna go take a bath. Make yourself at home. You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. And don't snoop, ok? \nSTARKS Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the way. \nWAITRESS [Shakes her head] No, no. Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, I don't want to meet you. I may want to help you tonight, but I don't want to know you. Honest. \nSTARKS nods as she walks out. \nEXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING \nSTARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD... \nINT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING \nSTARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with -- just some JARS and plenty of VODKA. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATER \nSTARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats. \nWAITRESS What's this? \nSTARKS The best I could do with what was in your fridge. She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other. \nThen she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since someone's done something like this for her. \nSTARKS I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... \nWAITRESS No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks. \nShe turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him... \nWAITRESS You want a drink? \nSTARKS Sure. \nINT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT \nAs she makes their DRINKS, a curious LOOK crosses her face, just for a second. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nThey've sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. \nWAITRESS This is pretty good. Considering... \nSTARKS Thanks. \nThey eat quietly for a second. STARKS looks at her, then down at his food, still subtly stunned by it all. \nSTARKS So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. \nWAITRESS Yup. That's me. \nSTARKS You like it? \nWAITRESS [Beat] I do it. \nSTARKS Have you always been a waitress? \nWAITRESS [Remembering sadly] No. I used to be a nurse. \nSTARKS [Beat] Why'd you stop? \nWAITRESS Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? \nSTARKS I don't know, but I think part of it's... \nSTARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with her. \nSTARKS That I don't really know what's real. \nShe stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on her lips. \nWAITRESS Well, good for you. \nIt's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out... \nHe winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across Starks' face. DR. GRIES checks his pulse and cleans his face as best as he can with a WET TOWEL. \nDR. GRIES William, can you hear me? \nHis VOICE echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin. \nSTARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in, afraid of what they've done to this man... \nINT. CADAVER DRAWER \nSTARKS clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes. FIVE SECONDS OF TOTAL BLACKNESS and SILENCE and he's back in... \nINT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' (JACKIE'S) APARTMENT, NIGHT \nOnly now, he's kneeling beside her sleeping FACE, just looking at it. STARKS doesn't know what's going on but her serene, sleeping face steadies him. He can only call out the name he thinks she might respond to... \nSTARKS Jackie? Jackie? \nSure enough, she answers with a STIR in her sleep. \nJACKIE Hm... \nWe see, in STARKS' eyes, the unbelievable connection: she is the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992. \nSTARKS [Swallowing, softly] Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? \nJACKIE [In a drunken slumber] What? \nSTARKS What year is it? \nJACKIE [Barely opening her eyes] \nSTARKS looks around as JACKIE moves in her sleep, almost falling off the couch. STARKS picks her up and, in her sleep, she WRAPS her arms around his neck. \nINT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT \nSTARKS tenderly lays her down on the bed... \nINT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT \nSTARKS picks up his DOG TAGS from the console, looks around, spots the TELEVISION and fumbles a bit as he figures out how to turn it on. STARKS sits down, throws back the rest of JACKIE'S DRINK and another shot and looks around nervously, unable to explain what's happening to him... \nFADE TO: \nINT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING \nJACKIE sits in her sleep as she wakes up, clearly hung over. \nINT. BATHROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING \nAs JACKIE closes the MEDICINE CABINET, she sees her hungover reflection in it. \nShe puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore some color and life in her. As she comes up, that's when she remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in her sleep. \nSTARKS [O.S., echoing distantly] Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? She SHOOTS UP from the sink, staring at her reflection. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, SECONDS LATER \nJACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper strewn all around him and the TV still on. He's holding the TAGS. \nShe kneels down close to his face and stares at him for awhile before STARKS is jarred. He defensively GRABS HER WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN, startling her. \nJACKIE [Desperately] Who are you? \nSTARKS lets his GRIP loosen. \nSTARKS [Beat] I'm William Starks. \nA short look of SHOCK cross her face before she leaps up. \nJACKIE Get the hell out of my house! \nJACKIE grabs the nearest object -- the IRON FORK from the FIREPLACE set -- and holds it, shaking, against STARKS. STARKS stays calm; he hardly expected a different reaction. \nJACKIE What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything. \nSTARKS [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. \nJACKIE If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police. \nSTARKS [Remembering] Your mom was passed out on the side of the road when I found you. Her name was Jean. [Beat] She was dizzy the whole time... \nJACKIE [Trembling] Why would you do something like this? I tried to help you. \nSTARKS Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it. \nJACKIE What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license? \nCRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER. \nAnd over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. MORGUE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY \nDR. GRIES, DR. BECKER, DAMON and NURSE HARDING enter the room. \nBECKER You left him in all night? \nNURSE HARDING Shit, he's probably dead. \nDR. GRIES [Defensively] I tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday... \nBECKER Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer. \nDR. GRIES We never should have done this to him... \nBECKER Well, what are we gonna do about it now? \nNothing is Gries' answer. Still, Becker seems to share the concern. \nBECKER motions for them to open the drawer. They pull him out. STARKS looks cold and wrecked. \nDR. GRIES Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead? \nBECKER feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one. \nBECKER No. [To Harding and Damon] Get him upstairs. \nINT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY \nDR. LORENSON walks into the ward to check on STARKS. The attending NURSE is walking around the ward. \nLORENSON Where's William Starks. \nNURSE I'm not sure. Dr. Becker had him moved. \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY \nDR. LORENSON walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital, peering into every room, looking for Starks. \nINT. ANOTHER HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY \nDR. LORENSON spots BECKER walking out the DOORS of the hospital and RUNS after him, in only his white coat... \nEXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, DAY (CONT'D) \nLORENSON [Calling out after him] Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait! \nDR. BECKER stops walking and waits a moment, registering the voice, before he turns around to face Dr. Lorenson. \nLORENSON [Out of breath] Where's William Starks? \nBECKER He's recovering on the third floor. \nLORENSON Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic! \nBECKER Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious? \nLORENSON He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom. His behavior's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics. \nBECKER And you know that from what, a couple two-minute stares across a room? \nLORENSON [Firmly] He didn't need anti-psychotics, if that's even all you're giving him...? \nBECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him. \nBECKER [Steadily] After he slashed me with a hospital instrument, I determined, in my professional opinion, that Mr. Starks, needed a little placating. \nLORENSON [Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked? \nBECKER You sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I took five stitches during a routine therapy session. \nLORENSON I'm sure he took some, too. \nBECKER [Smirking, unphased] Happens sometimes when you've got to restrain them. You watch the rest of us work. You know that. \nLORENSON [Appealing to him] Our patients are sick. \nBECKER Yes, they are. \nLORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something. \nLORENSON He's not gonna end up like Casey, Tom. Whatever happened to him is not going to \"happen\" to Starks. I don't know what you're trying to do here ...but he's not a lab animal, Tom. You can't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment. \nBECKER Jesus, you really don't let up, do you? Just because you failed your patient doesn't necessarily mean the rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to tarnish your war hero's image, but he is psychotic. \nBECKER Yes. [Caustically] And that's the sun and you're on earth. [Beat] And I know you know better. \nSTARKS begins to piece if together. BECKER, as we begin to see, is right. It is 1992 in Alpine Grove. \nSTARKS I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. \nBECKER In where? \nSTARKS [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket. \nThe NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting Starks really is delusional. Becker doesn't even flinch as STARKS tries to get a better look at Becker's face. \nBECKER We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to. \nSTARKS That wasn't a fucking restraint. \nBECKER Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is. \nSTARKS' EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the I.V. in his arm, lingering on it long enough that Starks braces himself for an ATTACK of some sort. But Becker just looks back innocently as he adjusts it. \nBECKER Relax. \nSTARKS Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here. \nBECKER [Pointedly] Of course you're not. \nThen he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it. \nBECKER You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition. \nSTARKS Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer. \nBECKER nods diagnostically. The NURSE's nonchalance about it as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS. \nSTARKS I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light. \nBECKER I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey... \nSTARKS I don't give a shit about your patient! \nBECKER I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather. \nSTARKS squints as he searches out Becker's face. \nBECKER Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his deeds were done... he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog. He couldn't even remember his name when I spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back. [Beat] Ted never went to prison because everyone -- including me -- was convinced he was sick. So he came here. \nBECKER leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening. STARKS is. \nBECKER Then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and I caught Ted stealing looks at her -- the kind you really have to steal if you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked Ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had... slain ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a look I'll never forget, and, when he answered, it wasn't with a color or any sort of physical description I'd expect. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"I remember it. I remember it well.\" [Beat] Those were actually his last words I think. \nBECKER's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and remorse as he recounts Ted's tale. \nSTARKS We are not birds of a feather. \nBECKER Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of. \nBECKER gets up and, as he moves out of the light, STARKS sees his BANDAGED CHEEK, reinforcing his memory of what happened... \nSTARKS [Provokingly] What happened to your cheek, Dr. Becker? \nBECKER I was careless. Happens sometimes. \nFADE TO: \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992 \nSTARKS looks out on the SNOW-COVERED GROUNDS from his room on the third floor. He seems pacified for the moment. \nINT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY \nEverything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad mechanics of managing madness. CATATONIC PATIENTS and dated equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a NURSE who walks among them, we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and GLAZED EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them. \nHis ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as she passes. STARKS has successfully made it out of his room. She turns one corner as STARKS hustles to turn another... \nINT. DAY ROOM, ALPINE GROVE \nSTARKS is almost   there. As RANDOM ORDERLIES pass him, STARKS lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head down so low they   can't see his face. They pass, and STARKS starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside. \nAs soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally, like he no longer remembers the risks. Instead he remembers what Jackie told him. \nJACKIE [O.S.] They found William Starks' body dead in the snow. \nSTARKS [O.S.] How'd he die? \nJACKIE [O.S.] I don't know. But he did die. \nEXT. GROUNDS, ALPINE GROVE \nSTARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's VOICE takes him by surprise. \nSTARKS stands up, ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen. The OBSERVERS look to BECKER for order. \nSTARKS Long live the Organization for the Organized! \nBECKER Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks! \nBut, at that, Jensen's completely lost it. His excitement erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF in the head. \nBECKER Sit down, Mr. Jensen! \nToo late. OTHER PATIENTS are on their feet, HANDS jubilantly up in the air. And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless order is soundly delivered in Becker's NOD to Damon. \nRANDOM PATIENTS Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker! \nDAMON and HARDING grab STARKS while the other members of the STAFF slowly calm the other patients. LORENSON is too busy to notice them taking Starks out. STARKS winks at MACKENZIE, who smiles somewhat sadly back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992 \nHARDING and DAMON stand above Starks, who lies on the brutal slab, already hemmed in the Jacket. \nDAMON Starks, you're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. \nDAMON slams him in the drawer. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nSTARKS' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in there with him. The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of nowhere, a DROP falls on his eye. PING! STARKS winces. He clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall. His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by the DRIPS -- making a score fit only for hell. He closes his eyes and begins to die... \nEXT. CRIME SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK, 1992 \nSTARKS and TENNY -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in silence in TENNY'S CAR. (We recognize the murder scene.) RED POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS doesn't see them yet. \nSTARKS and TENNY are talking to one another. TENNY's voice takes a dangerous tone. \nTENNY You ever been to jail? \nSTARKS No. \nTENNY nods, distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the GUN he's hidden there. \nTENNY It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been. \nSTARKS I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it... \nTENNY carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured and cautious with each word, each move. \nTENNY Well, I've never been to war, but I'm sure as hell not going back to prison. \nSTARKS [Finally spotting Harrison] What's he pulling us over for? \nTENNY [Still preparing himself] Recreation. \nOFFICER HARRISON walks up to their car. \nOFFICER HARRISON Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car, with your hands at your side please. \nSTARKS Why? \nOFFICER HARRISON [Sternly] Step out of the car. \nSTARKS Ok, sir. I was just asking what for. \nOFFICER HARRISON This is a stolen vehicle you're driving. Now put your hands in the air, out where I can see 'em. \nThat's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of the car to check on him. \nSTARKS Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for? \nTENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows, assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS. \nTENNY Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you ain't even worth a fucking bullet. \nTENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES \nTHE HIT. \nSTARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET... \nSTARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out, looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground, as he did in the scene before. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nSTARKS stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's back in there. Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN'S FOREHEAD that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the LIGHT gradually dims... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2004 \nSTARKS He was the only family I remember. \nDR. MORGAN [Nodding] I'll see what I can find out about Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson will know something. \nINT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 2004 \nDr. MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward. STARKS looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than it ever was in 1993. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA, LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004 \nAs they arrive outside Lorenson's office, MORGAN turns to them. \nDR. MORGAN Let me just tell her we're here. \nDR. MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS' HAND as they wait. It's hardly more than a couple seconds when LORENSON appears in the doorway. She looks at STARKS curiously and the two share a very lengthy, intense STARE. \nDR. LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks suspiciously. For his part, STARKS doesn't look as unfamiliar with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson. \nLORENSON Hello. I'm Beth Lorenson. \nShe puts out a hand that is trembling slightly. \nLORENSON It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks... \nSTARKS hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand. There is something very eerie about the exchange. STARKS quickly lets go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE... \nLORENSON And you are...? \nJACKIE looks back uncomfortably. \nJACKIE I'm just William's friend. \nLORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to Dr. Morgan. \nLORENSON I think we'll be fine from here. Thanks, Stanley. \nINT. LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004 \nLORENSON leans against her desk while STARKS and JACKIE sit in the chairs. As they talk, each seems cautious in his exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or doesn't know. \nLORENSON My God you look exactly like him. \nSTARKS I never knew my father. Did you? \nLORENSON Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient. \nSTARKS Why? \nLORENSON considers her answer. \nLORENSON At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things. \nSTARKS You thought my father was crazy? \nLORENSON No. I don't think he was crazy. He needed help...but he wasn't crazy. [Beat] Your father actually helped me with a case of mine. \nLORENSON waits to see if STARKS knows what she is talking about. \nSTARKS What case? \nLORENSON I was working with a boy named Eugene. \nSTARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does. \nJACKIE Who was Eugene? \nLORENSON [Peaked] He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you familiar with the case? \nJACKIE Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help? \nLORENSON It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him. \nJACKIE How? \nLORENSON He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. \nJACKIE I don't understand. \nLORENSON I still don't either, even after all these years. \nSTARKS Do you know how my father died? \nLORENSON [Unconvincingly] I don't know how much I remember but I seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another. \nSTARKS How'd he get it? \nLORENSON [Beat] I don't know. \nSTARKS But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... \nSTARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD -- and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief. \nSTARKS Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were the only things I could move. [Beat] Dead bodies don't bleed. And they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal. \nINT. HALLWAY, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE \nSTARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE, when STARKS spots DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously. \nDAMON You folks ain't supposed to be down here. \nJACKIE We were just leaving. \nDAMON doesn't take his eyes off Starks. \nDAMON Do I know you from somewhere? \nSTARKS You may have known my father, William Starks. DAMON smiles, remembering... \nDAMON That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. \nSTARKS He didn't either. \nDAMON [With a dirty laugh] I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when he had you. [Beat] You could be his ghost. \nSTARKS Did you know my father? \nDAMON Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right? \nSTARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange. \nSTARKS You wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? \nDAMON [Slightly apprehensive] No, I don't. I just remember them finding his body. \nSTARKS You don't know any more, Damon? \nDAMON [Shocked] How'd you know my name? \nSTARKS My father used to talk about you. \nDAMON Oh yeah, what'd he say? \nDamon's eyes betray his unease. \nSTARKS He said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail. \nDAMON is shocked, and cowed. So much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings. \nDAMON Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... \nSTARKS That's too bad. \nDAMON I thought you said you never knew your father. \nSTARKS I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? \nDAMON I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it. \nSTARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him. \nSTARKS He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. \nDAMON I never touched your father! I swear! Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven FEAR. STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he remembers... \nSTARKS You know something, Damon? You're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. Live with it. \nSTARKS looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away. \nEXT. CEMETERY, ALPINE GROVE GROUNDS, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS, December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE comes up behind him. \nJACKIE How long do we have? \nSTARKS I don't know. \nJACKIE They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed. \nSTARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to him. And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket. \nSTARKS How far away is that? \nPAGE MISSING \nJACKIE kisses his SCARS -- from the war and the Jacket -- and STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make love for the first time. \nINT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT \nJACKIE is lying in STARKS' arms, running her FINGERS over one of the SCARS on his chest. STARKS strokes her hair. \nSTARKS \nLORENSON nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing. \nSTARKS You don't believe me. \nLORENSON [Testing him] Well, what year do you think it is now? STARKS [Exasperated] I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992. Same as every sane person. \nLORENSON Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like? \nSTARKS It doesn't look all that different. \nLORENSON The future doesn't look different? \nSTARKS No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. \nLORENSON What about the world? \nSTARKS I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life. \nLORENSON looks at STARKS, unintentionally patronizing. \nLORENSON Do you think you're traveling in time? Is that it? \nSTARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson simply with his air of calm resolve. \nSTARKS Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc. \nLORENSON searches for another approach. \nLORENSON [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe? \nSTARKS Maybe. \nLORENSON [Matter-of-factly] Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife? \nSTARKS nods. \nLORENSON MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here. All because his wife left him for another man. \nSTARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his I.V. almost falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON. \nSTARKS [Adjusting it himself] Maybe that just makes him weak, not crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat] Still doesn't make me think I am. \n(MORE) \nSTARKS [Adjusting it himself] And, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think I am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first. \nLORENSON Why don't you help me? \nSTARKS Because I don't have time. \nLORENSON Why not? \nSTARKS I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it. \nLORENSON And how do you know that? \nSTARKS Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. \nLORENSON William, that is just another facet of my delusions. \nThen, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can. \nSTARKS And what about your work with Eugene -- the kid? Is that another facet of my delusions? \nLORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in her features. \nLORENSON How do you know about Eugene? \nSTARKS You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me. \nLORENSON doesn't know what to say. \nLORENSON [Somewhat angrily] How do you know about Eugene!? \nSTARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief] You told me. It's like two parts of you talking through me. Look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way I could know about him. \nLORENSON There obviously is, so what don't you just tell me how you found out about him. \nSTARKS looks at her convincingly. \nSTARKS Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true. \nLORENSON I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions. \nSTARKS NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me! \nLORENSON One thing's got nothing to do with the other. \nSTARKS They're not. \nJACKIE [Beat, lost] No. \nJACKIE notices how COLD Starks looks. \nJACKIE Maybe they're out. \nSTARKS nods. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows and sees NO CARS or PEOPLE on the street. JACKIE watches him despairingly. \nJACKIE How much time do we have? \nSTARKS [Distracted] I don't know. \nJACKIE What? What are you thinking? \nSTARKS There're no cars on this street. \nJACKIE looks around; there really aren't. \nJACKIE Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can that be? \nSTARKS turns to JACKIE, thinking. \nSTARKS I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? \nJACKIE I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. \nSTARKS Then why isn't there anyone around? \nJACKIE [Beat] I don't know. \nSTARKS runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in desperation. \nJACKIE What are you doing? \nSTARKS doesn't answer. \nJACKIE William! William! \nSTARKS opens his eyes. She sighs in relief. \nJACKIE Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have to come back. \nSTARKS starts to shake his head in disbelief, when suddenly, he realizes... \nSTARKS Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? \nJACKIE It's Sunday. \nSTARKS [Nodding] It's Sunday. \nJACKIE So? \nSTARKS looks ecstatic with hope. \nSTARKS Look where these people live. \nA small, beautiful, removed place. \nSTARKS They've got lives to be grateful for. \nJACKIE William, you're not making sense. \nSTARKS [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is. \nEXT. STREETS, SHELBOURNE \nJACKIE and STARKS head back to the only MAIN STREET in the town. As they approach the town church, they start to see a ROW of cars parallel-parked on the street. \nJACKIE pulls up to the entrance of the CHURCH. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS watches JACKIE get out of the car and walk up to the doors of the CHURCH. \nEXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 \nJACKIE boldly opens the CHURCH door. \nINT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 \nJACKIE sees the town seated in the Church. The PRIEST looks up at her briefly and some people turn around, but she closes the DOOR before she causes a major interruption. \nINT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 \nBECKER How did you come to know their names? \nSTARKS You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. \nBECKER I don't understand... \nSTARKS I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? \nBECKER I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. \nSTARKS No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket. \nBECKER [Stoically] I was sorry when I heard you died. I was, but...how was I to know you didn't shoot that police officer? \nSTARKS The same way you just said I didn't without my ever telling you. [Beat] And that still doesn't excuse what you did. Just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside. [Beat] You've earned your guilt, Becker. \nSTARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away towards the car. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, DAY, 2004 \nJACKIE and STARKS sit inside the parked car as STARKS touches his head. \nJACKIE That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. \nSTARKS No, he didn't. \nJACKIE What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you. \nAnd with those words, JACKIE starts to break down. \nSTARKS No one's killing anyone. \nSTARKS takes her hand and runs it over his head. \nSTARKS Touch me. I'm okay. \nSTARKS looks at her with love, understanding and, for the first time, a sense of peace. He strokes her hair to calm her down. \nSTARKS If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face. \nJACKIE Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we? \nSTARKS looks at her without answering. JACKIE wipes her eyes, fastens STARKS' seat belt, and seeing that Starks' EYES have started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the barely audible sound of the DRAWER opening, and their time ending, is heard. \nSTARKS Where are we going? \nJACKIE To the hospital. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 \nJACKIE and STARKS speed on the highway. As STARKS sleeps, JACKIE keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure he stays with her. \nINT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 \nJACKIE helps STARKS -- who's severely weakened at this point -- to the nurse's station. CLAIRE is there. \nJACKIE Claire, I need help. \nCLAIRE helps JACKIE, and they take him into a room. From afar, we hear CLAIRE asking about him. \nSTARKS What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker? \nJACKIE Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through. \nCLAIRE Jesus, what's happened to him? \nINT. ROOM, HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 \nJACKIE helps CLAIRE do for STARKS what they can; it doesn't seem like much at this point. \nSTARKS Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her. \nJACKIE Ok. Ssh. Rest. \nINT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, 2004 \nJACKIE stands above a PRINTER as it prints the information she's looked up about Dr. Lorenson. The PAPER gets jammed, and that's when JACKIE completely loses it. She WRESTLES with the printer as if it were responsible for what's happening. \nThen she realizes she's not alone. She looks back and sees CLAIRE, watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in her eyes. \nJACKIE [In a panic] He's not...? \nCLAIRE No, no. [Beat] Not yet. But he doesn't have long. Are you sure you don't want a doctor to look at him? \nJACKIE No! It won't do any good. [Beat] Please, Claire. They won't understand. \nCLAIRE acquiesces with her eyes. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE \nSTARKS is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's office -- still severely weakened. \nHe walks slowly to the OFFICE DOOR and feebly knocks. LORENSON answers and STARKS falls into her arms. \nLORENSON [Stunned] Oh dear God. \nINT. LORENSON'S OFFICE \nLORENSON has laid STARKS down on the COUCH in her office. STARKS can barely talk. He spews as much of it as he can out in his feverish state... \nSTARKS I'm William Starks. I'm not his son. And...and the kid you work with. Your friend's son...Eugene... \nLORENSON is stilled by the words STARKS just spoke. \nLORENSON I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you? \nSTARKS How...how do you know? \nLORENSON You told me this was how it happened. \nSTARKS I did? \nLORENSON Yeah. \nSTARKS clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him out. \nSTARKS Who...who kills me? \nLORENSON You have nothing to fear, William. \nBut when we look to see STARKS' reaction, he's not there... \nINT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING \nBECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not his SCARF, and walks out of his office with a decided urgency. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 \nBECKER pulls STARKS out of the drawer and looks down ruefully at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT, seeks the outline of Becker's face in the light. \nSTARKS [Whispering] Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I know what you did to your patients. \nBECKER looses the straps around Starks' neck to help him speak. \nSTARKS Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You didn't cure them. You killed them. \nBECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien. After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when, instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a stretcher. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING \nAs the SUN starts to rise, we see STARKS -- now cleaned up -- recovering in his bed. He is unconscious. From his window, we look down and see Dr. Lorenson's car pulling into the lot... \nFADE TO: \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING \nLORENSON, still wearing her winter gear, walks into Starks' room, anxiously checking his VITALS. Her anxious expression reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and sees an empty chair with only Becker's SCARF on it. \nLORENSON goes to the window in time to see BECKER getting into his car. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, LATER THAT MORNING \nSTARKS lies unconscious in the bed. The NURSE, SALLY, stops by the room to check on Dr. Lorenson. \nSALLY Would you like anything, Dr. Lorenson? \nLORENSON A cup of coffee would be great, Sally. Thanks. \nSALLY Is he gonna be ok? \nLORENSON I hope so. \nSALLY Me, too. \nLORENSON looks after her as she leaves. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, MORNING, 1992 \nLORENSON wakes up as STARKS stirs in his sleep, slowly waking up. \nLORENSON You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you. \nSTARKS Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me? \nLORENSON doesn't answer. \nSTARKS Can I get some paper and something to write with. \nLORENSON What for? \nLORENSON [Putting the pieces together] He got a little shock. [To himself] And it's reset him. Not permanently probably...but at least for a little while. They use it on epileptic patients sometimes... \nTALIA But he's not epileptic. \nLORENSON No, but he is having seizures. \nTALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's merely surprised. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 \nSTARKS looks up from his PAPER -- now covered in WORDS -- to see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but much better than before. \nSTARKS It worked, didn't it? \nLORENSON nods. \nSTARKS This is really happening, isn't it? \nDR. LORENSON [Beat] What do you need me to do? \nSTARKS [Beat] Thank you. \nSTARKS folds the LETTER. \nSTARKS I need to get this letter to someone. \nDR. LORENSON I can't take you out of here in your condition... \nSTARKS And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. \nDR. LORENSON No, it hasn't. \nSTARKS Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs. \nEXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 \nLORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows. \nINT. LORENSON'S CAR, DAY, 1992 \nLORENSON and STARKS are driving on the same, now familiar highway. \nSTARKS You know how to get there? \nLORENSON Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough. \nSTARKS Good. \nBob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live. \nEXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 \nDR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house. \nLORENSON You want me to come with you? \nSTARKS No, I'll be ok. \nSTARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still understandably soft. \nSTARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on. \nJACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to break down. \nSTARKS Hi. \nJACKIE [Surprised] Hey. [Beat] I remember you. \nSTARKS I remember you, too. \nSTARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful, and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate -- when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible from this innocent, still promising image. \nSTARKS Jackie, how have you been? \nJACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often. \nJACKIE I've been ok. \nSTARKS Good. How's your mom? \nJACKIE Ok, I guess. \nSTARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to crumble. \nSTARKS Do you think I could see her? She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in his eyes. \nJACKIE Sure. \nJACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway. \nINT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING \nMACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as LORENSON helps STARKS down the hall. He holds up his hand in the gesture of hello, or goodbye. \nSTARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile. \nSTARKS I'm telling you my story because it's the only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own. \nINT. BECKER'S HOME, SHELBOURNE, 1992 \nWe see BECKER taking his DRUGS. In his dark den, on his worn desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he administers to himself whatever aid he can... \nINT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992 \nJEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last words. \nSTARKS (V.O.) It's scary...and lucky...how much we can forget. Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments I'm talking about, you realize it doesn't. And it never had to. \nINT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992 \nTENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar... \nINT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992 \nJACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking for something specific in them. She stops finally when she finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts them around her neck. \nSTARKS (V.O.) I am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I saw more of it. \nThen, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them under her sweater. \nINT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992 \nCAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV broadcasting news about MIKE TYSON'S RAPE CONVICTION. Medley's barely watching the footage... \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 \nDr. Lorenson helps Starks back to bed. STARKS looks up at Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes. LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more weakened self. \nSTARKS (V.O.) And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in. And, while you're alive, it's never too late. \nThen he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks' room and the screen darken at the same time. \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 \nTWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the night, through the now familiar passage to the basement... \nSTARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT. \nThey slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS. \nIn slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT... \nDISTORTED VOICE No! Wa...atch out! \nBut STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks' head. \nBLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right. \nThe details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the WOUND they said he died from. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 \nSTARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head onto the floor. \nThe PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently, as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one. \nWhen the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in. \nAs the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS in. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL \nIt's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally retrieved his memory without it haunting him... \nSTARKS (V.O.) I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen...sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. [Beat] You want to come back. \nPANELS: \nThe PANELS we saw briefly are completed further now. \n1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK as a small child's HAND touches it. \n2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME): STARKS, \naged 9, running up the stairs, knocking a PICTURE on the wall with his elbow... \n3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH of Starks' father, a much older version of himself. \n4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water that's not to deep and, \n", "test1_input": "THE JACKET \nWritten by \nMassy Tadjedin \nBased on a screenplay by \nMarc Rocco \nApril 15, 2003 \nA pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to. \nAfter some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man. \nWILLIAM STARKS (V.O.) I was 25 years old the first time I died... \nINT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY \nOne more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers. \nOur glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood -- and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull. \nThen, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does the pace of the world around him. \nINT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY \nWILLIAM STARKS (V.O.) I remember there was so much white everywhere. And I felt peace...even though there was war around me. And I felt alive, even though I knew I was dead. \nINTERN #1 Come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here. \nAn INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand. \nINTERN #2 [Reading from the TAGS] Starks, William. Born December 25, \nINTERN #1 Wait, so how old? \nINTERN #2 \nINTERN #1 [Searching through records] Here he is. William Starks. Born in Vermont. He hasn't got a family listed. The naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him. \nAs the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide- open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life. She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her. \nINTERN #2 [Calling out] Oh my God! This soldier is ALIVE! Code blue! CODE BLUE! This man just blinked! \nINTERN #1 He's been tagged already. Worry about the others... [then seeing STARKS blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We need a doctor! Get a doctor over here now! \nAs the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS, preparing NEEDLES and OXYGEN MASKS, STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow the now BLOODIED white sheet as it falls to the ground... \nEXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY \nA NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) -- a particularly photogenic and affable participant. \nCAPTAIN MEDLEY The level of arms on the ground really depends. [Answering a question] But no, I'd have to say we haven't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected. \nNEWSANCHOR Have you lost any men today, Captain? \nCAPTAIN MEDLEY No. One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it. Looks that way... \nFLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY \nWe see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs, enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off. \nEXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAY \nSTARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him. \nSTARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before -- is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down. \nDOCTOR Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out... \nMAJOR But he's never gonna be able to remember what happened? \nDOCTOR It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or... [lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression. It's very common with traumas like this. \nSTARKS [Cutting him off] Sergeant Starks is in the room, [beat] and I want to know when I'm going home. \nWhen he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his surroundings. \nLIEUTENANT Sergeant, you have no surviving family in the States. I'm sure you have friends or distant relatives, but unfortunately we have no record of them yet. \nMAJOR Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart, Sergeant. \nSTARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket. \nSTARKS Can I have one of those? \n", "test1_true": "The LIEUTENANT lights one for him. \nDOCTOR There is help for you, Sergeant. \nLIEUTENANT Of course there is. Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette, blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes. He's finished with these men and everything they stand for. \nSTARKS [V.O.] I didn't know where my home was. I just knew I didn't want to be there anymore. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY \nSTARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long highway. He seems to be walking away from things even if he can't remember what they are yet. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY \nJEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and her daughter, JACKIE (8) tremble in the cold next to their stalled car. JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to her chest, more like a child than her daughter. \nJACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them. He cuts an arresting figure against the empty landscape. \nJACKIE Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep... \nSTARKS You two ok? \nJACKIE Our car won't start. \nSTARKS [Looking at JEAN] What's your mom's name? \nJACKIE [Cautiously] Jean. \nSTARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down. \nSTARKS Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need you to try to wake up, Jean. \nJEAN opens her eyes, stone red. \nSTARKS Your mom take anything before this happened? \nJACKIE Yeah, but I don't know what. \nSTARKS [Beat] What's your name? \nJACKIE Jackie. \nJACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand. STARKS smiles and briefly shakes it. STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks of what to do. \nSTARKS Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a look at your car. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY \nAs Starks works on their engine, JACKIE anxiously watches her mother throw up in the distance. STARKS sees her watching and tries to distract her. \nSTARKS What do you think of all this snow? \nJACKIE looks at him curiously. \nJACKIE [Beat] Nothing. \nSTARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie turns her head back towards her mother. \nJACKIE But I like it I guess. \nSTARKS Hey, can you reach the gas pedal? \nJACKIE Yeah. \nJACKIE gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just enough so her foot reaches the pedal. \nSTARKS Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing it. \nJACKIE revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters later, the car settles into a nice, working hum. \nJACKIE [Smiling] It works! \nJACKIE steps down. She looks like she could hug Starks and, unexpectedly, decides to. As STARKS awkwardly returns it, he sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter. \nJEAN Get your fucking hands off my daughter! \nJACKIE Mom, he just fixed our car. \nJEAN Jackie, get in the car. NOW! \nJEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up. \nJEAN Look, I don't want any trouble, so... \nSTARKS Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my way. \nJACKIE Mom, you've got it wrong... \nSTARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags. \n", "test2_input": "STARKS The Jacket. \nMACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it. \nMACKENZIE Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think... \nSTARKS No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days. \nJust then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks towards them. \nHARDING What are you two yappin' about? \nSTARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this point. \nMACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut] [Beat] We're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future. [To Starks] That is what we're talking about here, right? \nSTARKS is startled MacKenzie gets it. \nSTARKS Yeah, it is. \nHARDING You know something? You're two fucking freaks is what you are. \nSTARKS [Smiling] Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you think we're doing in this place? \nMACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out. \nHARDING I want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food. \nHARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns. \nSTARKS [Under his breath] I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie. \nMACKENZIE It's gonna be sticky. \nSTARKS Why? \nMACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in its sudden jerks accompanying every word. \nMACKENZIE 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! \nSTARKS So what am I supposed to do? \nMACKENZIE You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something. \nINT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY \nDr. LORENSON and DR. GRIES are walking briskly to a meeting. \nDR. GRIES We're late. \nLORENSON I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have. \nDR. GRIES Maybe it's not such a waste. \nLORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record straight. \nLORENSON It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about. \nDR. GRIES They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for. \nLORENSON can see GRIES is trying to tell her something. \nLORENSON What should they be looking for? \nDR. GRIES They should just be looking harder. \nLORENSON grabs GRIES' arm, sensing the import of her words. \nLORENSON Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he? \nDR. GRIES Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now. \nINT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY \nSTARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around -- presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young, fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY, administering medication from a dated CART. \nSTARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her. \nThe BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as the BRUTE reaches the NURSE. \nHe throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it. \nThe BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he understands pain. \nSTARKS [To Sally] You ok? \nAs she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes perilously close to STARKS' head. \nThe BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified. Is this when he dies? \n", "test2_true": "SALLY Are you ok? \nSTARKS Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone? Where is everyone? \nSALLY [Defensively] There's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. But I've been alone before... \nSTARKS Where are the other orderlies? \nSALLY In the therapy session downstairs. That's what the rep's sitting in on... \nSTARKS Ok, listen. I want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you. I'll go get some doctors. \nSALLY looks at STARKS, wondering whether she can trust him. Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers that she can. \nINT. MAIN ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992 \nThe STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF (Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters... \nSTARKS [Calling out] Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker. \nBECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response. \nBECKER Mr. Starks, this session is for our civil patients. Damon, please take Mr. Starks back to his ward. STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze. \nSTARKS [Derisively] No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap me in a Jacket or even gag me, but please don't leave me out of therapy. This is where I feel like I make the most progress. \nBECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less. \nBECKER Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a chair for yourself. \nAs STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down. \nBECKER Mr. Jensen, please continue. \nJENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's about to... \nJENSEN Well, [beat] I've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization. \nBECKER's not listening to a word JENSEN says. But STARKS is. \nBECKER [Calm as ever] And what have they approached you about, Mr. Jensen? \nJENSEN They want me to head the Organization for the Organized. \nThe other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE REP listens limply. \nBECKER The Organization...for the Organized? \nJENSEN That's right. Have you heard of them? \nBECKER No, Mr. Jensen. I have not. \nGROUP PATIENT 2 That's because there is no such Organization, you idiot. \nJENSEN That is categorically not true. Bl-bl- blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE. I've been asked to lead them. But, if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush-hush, would they? \nBECKER [Wearily] What do the rest of you think? \nThe GROUP stares at one another silently. \nSTARKS [Loud and emphatic] Well, [beat] I know they exist. \nBECKER And how is that? \nSTARKS looks at JENSEN, who looks back avidly. MACKENZIE eyes Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do. \nSTARKS When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized. \nBECKER [Incensed] Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr. Jensen. \nSTARKS [Looking right at Jensen] It is a fact. Bona fide, and classified. \nLORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously. \nJENSEN I knew it! I knew it! Those little fuckers are everywhere. \nSTARKS They recruit only the best, Mr. Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have to say this... \nNot even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence... \nSTARKS But these people [pointing to the Doctors] know about it. In fact, when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to Alpine Grove. They're among us right now! [Looking right at Becker] Isn't that right, Dr. Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they picked you. \nJENSEN looks on nobly. \nSTARKS They're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm? \nSTARKS suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut. \nSTARKS [Looking suddenly directly at Becker] All they do is give orders. That's all they have to do. And no one will ever know. All it comes down to is an order. [Beat] They've got hands everywhere. \n", "test3_input": "STARKS And wound up in a better cage. [Beat] But I still want to make a deal. \nBECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS proceeds with the calculation of someone who is guilty. \nSTARKS See, the deluxe lab animal treatment I've been receiving -- well, I don't think it's worked. I woke up today and realized... [eerily lowering his voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So really, what was the point? Torture? I think that's still sort of illegal in some states -- though we'll have to check on Vermont. And, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak. [Beat] Last time I checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly] \"I don't remember everything they did to me. I just remember the worst parts.\" I think I should be sitting down when I say it, don't you think? \nIt takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this. \nBECKER I think...I have to think about it. \nBECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him. STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when he's killed. \nBut BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm, tearing his skin with it. \nBECKER I think your story needs a little fleshing out before it's ready to go. \nBECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor. \nBECKER I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off. \nSTARKS You sure you know where to find one? \nBECKER I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks. \nSTARKS And what does that mean? \nBECKER Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to. \nSTARKS smirks at the hypocrisy he sees. \nSTARKS Becker, how do you sleep at night? \nBECKER You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug. \nBECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over. \nINT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, EVENING \nLORENSON, dressed to leave, stops to talk to NINA, one of the evening nurses. \nLORENSON Nina, William Starks is to stay in ICU all night. If anything is supposed to change, I want to be called about it. \nNINA Sure, Dr. Lorenson. \nINT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, 1992 \nLORENSON comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a thin, young mother, TALIA YAZDI, and her eleven year-old mute, and seemingly retarded son, EUGENE, waiting for her outside her door. \nLORENSON Hi. [Beat] Sorry I'm late. \nTALIA It's ok. [To Eugene] Hi, Eugene. \nEUGENE returns her greeting with a blank stare. \nINT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, SOME TIME LATER \nLORENSON sets her things down on the kitchen table as TALIA starts to tidy things around the apartment. \nLORENSON Talia, I need to ask you something. \nTALIA looks at LORENSON. \nTALIA What is it? \nLORENSON Have you told anyone about my sessions with Eugene? \nTALIA [With an accent] Of course not. [Off Lorenson's still doubtful look] I swear I haven't. I wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you. You know that. \nLORENSON Has anyone been asking about him? \nTALIA No. I would have told you. \nLORENSON nods. She believes her. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 \nSTARKS spots DAMON standing cautiously in the hall. \nINT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 \nWe see (but don't hear) HARDING speak to NINA as DAMON slips into STARKS' ROOM. NINA seems sufficiently distracted. \nINT. STARKS' ROOM, SECONDS LATER \nDAMON flashes a KNIFE at STARKS. \nDAMON No funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you. \nOne look at the KNIFE and the SAME QUESTION burns once more... \n", "test3_true": "INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 \nDAMON hustles Starks down the hall as fast as they can before the NURSE or any other staff member spots them. \nINT. OFFICE/LIBRARY, LORENSON'S HOME, NIGHT \nEUGENE sits opposite LORENSON, who quietly observes him, jotting some notes down on her pad. She is intermittently holding up PICTURES for Eugene, asking him to repeat their names as if she were teaching him to read. \nLORENSON Eugene, this is a \"TRAIN.\" \nEUGENE starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only with a blank stare. Lorenson quickly moves beside Eugene and watches him from up close, apparently not altogether surprised at what's happening. \nEUGENE doesn't even blink. The only sounds we hear from him are a couple, barely audible guttural noises. LORENSON -- exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently addresses the boy. \nLORENSON Come on back down here. Wherever you are...try to come on back. You'll like it, I promise. \nJust then, TALIA walks in with TEA, JUICE and COOKIES for Eugene and Lorenson. She spots her son in his absent, staring state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them. \nTALIA gently touches LORENSON'S hand. LORENSON looks at her warmly. TALIA knows how hard she's trying. \nINT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 \nBECKER soundlessly watches as HARDING and DAMON finish strapping Starks in the Jacket. \nDAMON slams the DRAWER shut, sending STARKS back in. \nINT. JACKET/TUNNEL \nWhat STARKS lacks in strength, he counteracts with his OVERWHELMING WILL. The SCREEN TREMBLES with it. One TERRIFIC, WHITE LIGHT and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS sits by himself in Jackie's car, parked in a gas station. He looks around, trying to make sure it really is her car. He looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and an empty BOTTLE of VODKA. \nHe looks outside and sees a few people walking into the FOOD MART of the gas station. He trembles with cold as he looks down at his plaid shirt. Then, JACKIE unexpectedly appears outside the DRIVER'S WINDOW opening the car door and nearly spilling her COFFEE when she spots STARKS next to her. \nSeeing it's him though, she smiles warmly. \nJACKIE You just scared me, that's all. \nShe leans over to him and gives him a kiss, handing him the coffee. \nSTARKS Me, too. \nJACKIE Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going. \nEXT. MAIN STREET, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004 \nJACKIE speeds through the streets of Shelbourne, presumably on their way to Becker's house. \nEXT. BECKER'S NEIGHBORHOOD, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004 \nThey've slowed down a little. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY \nJACKIE reads from some directions on a PAPER as their CAR slows down on one particular street, towards one particular house. \nEXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY \nJACKIE [O.S.] I think this is his house. \nINT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS looks at the house, bedecked with a lopsided SNOW MAN on the front lawn. \nSTARKS You're sure? \nJACKIE Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired \nM.D. \nSTARKS gets out of the car. \nEXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS knocks on the door. No answer. \nEXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY \nJACKIE tries to look through the windows to see if anyone's there. No one is. It looks small and dark inside. \nEXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY \nSTARKS knocks again, looking down anxiously at his feet. JACKIE walks up to him from around the side of the house. They don't have the time to wait. \nJACKIE They're not here. \n"}

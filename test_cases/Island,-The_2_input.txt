LINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across the seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as-- 
THE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL- 
ESTER Don't hurt him! 
ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach-- LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor-- 
Ester DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face- THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as -- 
- B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead. 
- T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s - starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor-- 
Ester STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast- 
ESTER Lincoln? 
L i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester- 
LINCOLN RUN!!! 
67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER 
CENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down-- 
68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER 
A HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor-- 
69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER 
CENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then- 
SCHEER Somebody get someone down here! 
A Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity-- 
70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 
THE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies-- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open-- 
SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door, taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake -- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random, running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth-- 
SCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing-- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then-- THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons. His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close. SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to-- 
SCHEER (ON HEADSET) Ethercon! The elevator - override it! Do you read me? Bring it back down! 
71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM 
Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles, navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically- 
ETHERCON (INTO HEADSET) You're off the grid, sir. Give me a second. Can you tell me where you are? 
He recoils at the blaring volume of the response. 
72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR 
Scheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty. 
SCHEER (INTO HEADSET) Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock them down. Access only on my command. 
73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL 
A dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive. Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open. 
74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS 
Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window. 
Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled foetally. I t is known as a "nascent". In this tank is a female nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from. 
LINCOLN Ester ! Come on! 
Spurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall. Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare. 
75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER 
A STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT: ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks. It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow. ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression. 
RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber. No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks. He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up- 
CENSOR Nothing , sir. No sign.

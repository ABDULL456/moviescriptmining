INT. TOWN HALL. DAY 
A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side. As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and the others take places in the gallery 
CLERK All photographers are now asked to leave. 
The PHOTOGRAPHERS go. 
JUDGE The defendants, please. 
From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent. 
JUDGE The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers. (MORE) 
JUDGE (cont'd) They're going to be arguing that there's no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial. 
DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation. 
JUDGE I am going to take these cases one by one. 
MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working. 
MICHAEL Do you want a pen? 
MARTHE I've got a pen. 
So MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks. 
JUDGE Hanna Schmitz. 
There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA, her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance. 
JUDGE Your name is Hanna Schmitz? 
HANNA Yes. 
It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks up, hearing it for the first time. 
JUDGE Can you speak louder please? 
HANNA My name is Hanna Schmitz. 
MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring. 
JUDGE Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE You joined the SS in 1943? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE What was your reason? What was your reason for joining? 
HANNA doesn't answer. 
JUDGE You were working at the Siemens factory at the time?

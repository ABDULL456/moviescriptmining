DONOVAN Well, it's not the best material I've ever had to work with, but I'll do my best to see we move up a notch this year. 
RACHEL I know you will, Charlie. That's why I'm movin' you up to General Manager. Congratulations. 
Rachel sticks out her hand. Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, bewildered by this whole development. 
RACHEL Well, that should do it for today. Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to work. 
With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded. 
MATTHEWS (checking his watch) One minute, 58 seconds. 
INT. DONOVAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY 
Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, there's a voice at the door. 
BODY-BUILDER ASSISTANT Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps would like to see you. 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Donovan is ushered in by Rachel's Male Secretary. Donovan carries his player roster with him. 
INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY CONT 
RACHEL Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat. 
DONOVAN I'm glad you called me in. I'm still unclear on a couple things 
RACHEL Oh, really? Like what? 
DONOVAN Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna be the Manager? 
RACHEL I was thinking of Lou Brown. 
DONOVAN Lou Brown? 
RACHEL He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the last 30 years. 
This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan. 
RACHEL I think he'll fit right in with our team concept. 
DONOVAN What exactly is our team concept? 
RACHEL That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami. 
DONOVAN What do you mean? (referring to the roster) Some of these guys are furniture movers? 
RACHEL I'm serious about this, Charlie. It's no secret I've never liked Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick. Another couple of years of this and I'm gonna have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food. 
Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust. 
DONOVAN Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim... 
RACHEL It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs. No other franchise in baseball can match that deal. 
DONOVAN Even so, the League'll never let us leave Cleveland. We got a lease with the city. 
RACHEL The lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year. (pushing across a copy of the lease) Paragraph 40, line 17. 
Donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow. 
RACHEL If we play bad enough, we should be able to come in under that. 
DONOVAN What are you saying? You want us to lose? 
RACHEL No, we've been losing. What I want us to do is finish dead last. 
Donovan is stunned. He casts around helplessly for some response. 
DONOVAN Mister Phelps would never have approved of this. 
RACHEL He knew it had to be done. He just didn't have the courage to do it. (with veiled menace) Hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of it. (pause) If this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst record in all baseball. 
On Donovan's sunken face, we go to: 
EXT. SHABBY MEXICAN HOTEL - MORNING 
On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway. OVER we hear a telephone RING.

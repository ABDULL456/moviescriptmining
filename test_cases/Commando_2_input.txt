Gun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's hand and picks the gun up. Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He begins walking with him. 
MATRIX Where is she, Sully? 
SULLY Fuck you... Matrix is approaching the Sunbeam as Cindy is getting out. He swings Sully by the heels and BEATS Sully's head against the fender, leaving another dent in the already beat-up car. 
CINDY That's my car, Matrix!! Matrix continues to carry Sully upside down. 
MATRIX I can't hear you, Sully. 
SULLY 
FUCK YOU!! 
MATRIX Loyalty is touching, Sully, but it's not important in your life right now... 
VERY WIDE ANGLE 132 We SEE Matrix walk right up to the edge of a steep drop along Mulholland Drive. He has walked out of Cindy's sight. X 
Â¢ MATRIX But take gravity... He extends his arms and DANGLES Sully upside-down over the sharp drop. The Los Angeles Basin is spread out below, 180 degrees of twinkling lights. 
MATRIX Gravity is very important in your life right now. Cont.

REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 39 132 Cont. Sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to his face starts to redden it. Matrix lets go with his right arm. Sully's head drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then adjusts to the new weight. 
SULLY Uhhhh... 
MATRIX I have to warn you, Sully... 
(TAPPING IT) This is my weak arm. 
SULLY 
(DEFIANT) You can't kill me, Matrix. You X need me to find your daughter. 
MATRIX Where is she? He SHAKES Sully, moving him like a fish on a line. 
SULLY I don't know, but Cooke knows. I could take you where I'm supposed to meet him. 
MATRIX But you won't. 
SULLY Why not? Matrix uses his right hand to take something from his pocket and he dangles it in front of Sully. It's Sully's motel key. 
MATRIX Because I already know where. Fear starts to show in Sully's face for the first time as he STARES at the key. He tried to grab at the key, X but Matrix pulls it out of his reach. 
MATRIX Remember when I promised to kill you last, Sully? Cont.

ANDY Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky. 
As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the music rocks up and we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARBOR - DAY 
Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times. 
It's cruising, on water. 
EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY 
with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke. 
JACKIE How fast does this go? 
ANDY With the right wind, 15-20 knots. 
JACKIE What? 
MIKE Real fast. 
He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze. 
BROOKE Far out! 
Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more fun than a roller coaster. 
ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER" 
overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr., the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside. 
LARRY Coming up! 
BOB Gangway, Turkies! 
It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," and Mike's "Green Machine." The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe." 
ANDY We're carrying weight. 
LARRY We'll take your supercargo. 
JACKIE Is that me? 
BROOKE That's you. 
JACKIE I've never been supercargo. 
Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air. 
LARRY Hey, get out of our air! 
DONNY Want a passenger? 
ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX 
Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails tight as a tick to the red cat. 
BOB Way to go! 
QUICK CUTS: FUN AT SEA 
The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local teen-agers partying with each other: 
--  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull. 
--  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze. 
--  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch." 
--  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable. 
--  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in Tina's Joy. 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY 
Silent, green-blue depths. A diver, Crosby, working the bottom, running a search pattern. Another diver, Tom Andrews, running close. They signal to each other, and make another pass. 
Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of the Orca, half-buried in the silt. A diver's line runs up and 
OUT OF THE FRAME, TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY 
Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying a diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua Sports" lettered on it somewhere. Hendricks and Red are on the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser. 
HENDRICKS Rich or poor, it's nice to have money. 
RED Figure they split? 
HENDRICKS Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting. 
A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera. 
ANDREWS This is all there is. 
Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands. 
HENDRICKS If that's it, that's it. 
The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, and we:

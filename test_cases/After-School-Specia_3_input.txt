FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        95. 
Coop gives the thumbs up to the Bouncer, also dressed in a tux, then starts making out with Ashley in an exaggerated tongue-lapping display. BEHIND THE CAMERA, Matt peeks out and looks at the other two guys with a furled brow. Deacon gives him a forced thumbs up. 95B   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95B Coop and Ashley sit in the back seat of a Split Car. Coop says, "Oh, Rachael. You're the best." Fred looks over at Deacon, who just smiles sheepishly. 95C   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95C The Bouncer and Coop play chess as the guys capture the offscreen action. Ashley says, "You're the sexiest teacher I ever had." The guys turn their heads sideways to figure out the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have gotten themselves into. 95D   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95D Plantain, dressed as a chaperone with a big punch stain on her dress, is eating a tuna fish sandwich and smoking a cigarette. Matt calls "Okay, people. Places. Let's get it together." Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with Weylon J. Petunia's. PLANTAIN My dress is ruined! BOUNCER I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we going to do? She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy underwear. 95E   INT. BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY                                       95E Fred is in the bathroom with the Moisty-Mate, but he just can't seem to get in the mood. Through the door: PLANTAIN (O.S.) I never knew chaperoning the prom could be so "hard." Fred gives up and throws the lotion back in his book bag. When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly. 95F   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95F The Bouncer is going at it with an ugly sex face, dripping with sweat.

Fred lowers the boom and it smacks the Bouncer in the head. Deacon applauds, trying to rally the troops, "Good scene. Good scene." 96G   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         96G Plantain speaks with no real enthusiasm, "I give you an A+." Matt asks her to do the line again, but she says it exactly the same way again. One more time, same result. Suddenly Coop lets out a huge FART and everyone starts laughing. Matt throws his hands up, frustrated. 95H   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         95H Coop and Ashley are in the back seat, post coitus. ASHLEY That was the best prom ever. COOP You can say that again. And as Ashley actually repeats her line, we see Fred mouthing it along with her, proud of his contribution to the script. 95J   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                           95J Matt strips off the sheets, sprays them with lighter fluid, and sets them on fire. As the flames rise up and FILL THE SCREEN, MATT (O.S.) Cut. That's a wrap. END MONTAGE. 96    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY                    96 Deacon is studying in the library. RACHAEL (O.S.) Deacon! He turns around and there she is: RACHAEL UNGER. DEACON Rachael? RACHAEL Hi, how are you? DEACON Good. Good. How was France? RACHAEL It was so fun. We just got back yesterday. The school totally screwed up my class schedule.

Deacon looks her over. DEACON So, how's John Baldwin? Rachael goes white. RACHAEL Who told you about that? DEACON Everybody knows. RACHAEL Well everybody is a liar. I never did it with John Baldwin. Deacon is stunned. DEACON You didn't? RACHAEL Jesus, Deacon. I don't even know him. It's not like it was with us. It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks. 97   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                  97 Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the computer. FRED So...? DEACON How does it look? MATT It looks great. It's the best porno film I've ever made. FRED So what's the problem? DEACON Are you done with it? MATT Well, I cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think I can finish this film. FRED Why not?

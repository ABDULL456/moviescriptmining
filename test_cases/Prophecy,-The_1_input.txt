DAGGETT Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at noon? At the little girl's house? 
KATHERINE First trailer on the highway past town. 
Thomas climbs out. 
KATHERINE I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you don't seem very like a police officer to me. 
DAGGETT That's what my bosses keep saying. 
KATHERINE I meant it as a compliment. 
DAGGETT So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley. 
KATHERINE Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Thomas lying in his hotel bed, flinching through a dream- filled sleep. 
There's glimpses of shattered images: War. Death. And a small, dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling. 
Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is something dark and winged. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end of town. 
INT. MINE 
Deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his trumpet. There's just the blanket he sits on and a single candle. Jerry comes around the corner. 
GABRIEL Get any sleep? (Jerry only stares) -- Just kidding. 
EXT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING 
As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby. 
Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to put his fingers. 
GABRIEL ...There, and there. Now pucker your lips... aim it that way, and just blow a little bit, this is a special trumpet. 
The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud. 
GABRIEL Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, have a Junior Mint on me. Open up. 
As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down into it. Looking for something... 
GABRIEL Who's next? 
Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second grade friends, and puts her on his knee. 
GABRIEL And who are you? 
SANDRA Sandra. 
She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet. 
GABRIEL And did you see the man upstairs, Sandra? 
SANDRA A little. 
GABRIEL Did you talk to him? 
SANDRA No. 
GABRIEL And who did, Sandra. Who talked to the man? 
SANDRA Mary. 
GABRIEL And where is Mary, Sandra? 
SANDRA She isn't here. She's sick. 
GABRIEL You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. Here, let me see... 
He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her mouth, and gazes in. 
Katherine enters the circle. 
KATHERINE What the hell do you think you're doing? 
Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles. 
GABRIEL Just talking to the kids, Ma'am.

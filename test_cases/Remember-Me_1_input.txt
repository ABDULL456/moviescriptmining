Tyler nods. 
Charles appraises his son. 
CHARLES Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime. 
Charles walks ahead, pulling out his cell phone. 
Tyler calls after him. 
TYLER Thank you for bailing me out. 
Charles, without turning around, 
CHARLES No problem. 
101   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS -- BEAUTIFUL SEPTEMBER MORNING     101 
Tyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the crowd. 
102   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- JUST AFTER.                 102 
No mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her. 
Shakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but walks next to him. 
103   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE STATUE -- JUST AFTER.            103 
Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline with him. 
Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally watches from a bench. 
As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early September tanning possibilities. 
Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her. 
Beat. 
ALLY Using the little sister is dirty pool. 
TYLER (carefully) Is it working? 
Beat. 
ALLY Maybe. 
Tyler has a smile the size of New York City. 
Ally smiles back. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
104   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING                    104 
Bright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep. 
Tyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light streaming in. 
TYLER (nuzzling) Hey...Hey. 
ALLY Hmmm. 
TYLER I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office. 
ALLY (sleepily) Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast? 
TYLER Whichever tastes better a la mode. 
Ally smiles. 
ALLY Say hi to your dad for me. 
Tyler watches her lying there. 
TYLER If I said I love you... what would you say? 
ALLY (laughing) I love you. 
TYLER I love you too. 
Tyler kisses her. Then heads out into the... 
105   INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                        105 
Aidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he went out in the night before. Tyler watches him sleep.

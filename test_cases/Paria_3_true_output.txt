BINA You don't dress. You just come however. Come as you are. 
Alike nods. 
BINA (CONT'D) Can I see? 
Bina snatches the book from Alike's hands and starts flipping through pages before Alike can answer. 
ALIKE Yeah...But that's mainly old stuff, though. 
BINA This is the one you did today? 
ALIKE Yeah. 
BINA Nice. 
Bina offers the journal back to Alike. Alike reaches for it. Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of keep away. 
BINA (CONT'D) Take it. 
Alike misses again. The girls crack up. 
BINA (CONT'D) Sorry, here. 
Bina yanks it away again. Alike gives up, still smiling. 
ALIKE You play too much. 
BINA Seriously, it's right here.     Just take it. 
Alike summons the courage for one last swipe. She manages to grab it but Bina doesn't let go right away. The girls lock eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war. 
ALIKE Thank you... 
BINA You're welcome... 
Beaming with her victory, Alike busies herself with the journal. Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next foray. She dances the moose up Alike's arm and plants an exaggerated peck on her cheek with it. 
BINA (CONT'D) Mmmwaahhh! 
The girls erupt into renewed giggles. Bina tosses the stuffed animal aside and scoots closer to read over Alike's shoulder. 
BINA (CONT'D) What's so private? 
ALIKE Nothin', just my writings... 
Bina studies Alike's profile. She leans in and pecks Alike on the cheek. Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina sidelong. Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss on Alike's lips. Alike pulls away. Bina tenses for the verdict. 
ALIKE (CONT'D) Why'd you do that for? 
BINA Sorry--- 
ALIKE No, I'm sorry. I just umm...I gotta go. 
BINA I thought-- 
ALIKE Sorry. 
Alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door, Bina flounders in her wake. 
52   INT. LAURA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                          52 
Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a PERSONAL CHEERLEADER. Music blasts from the TV but doesn't drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage. There is a knock at the door. 
LAURA You'll get that for me? 
One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door without greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to escort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at the fringes of the pack. 
ALIKE Wassup man. 
A collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table although no one addresses Alike directly. Laura slams the table and raises her hands in triumph. 
LAURA Board, goddammit!! I told you!

BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about. \nMRS. BLAISE Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea.  Any other comments? (with dread) Kat? \nKat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up. \nKAT Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys? \nMRS. BLAISE I'm sorry? \nKAT This book is about a guy and his fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial topic. \nThe other students roll their eyes. \nKAT (continuing) Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats. \nJOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row. \nJOEY As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends? \nA few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture \nMRS. BLAISE That's enough, Mr. Dorsey. \nReally gets fired up now \nKAT I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time \nShe looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her pill box. \nKAT (continuing) What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir? \nPatrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, embroidered on his workshirt. \nPATRICK Mother Goose? \nThe class titters.  Kat wears an expression of intolerance \nINT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nKat now sits before Miss Perky. \nMISS PERKY Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. \nKAT Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. \nMISS PERKY Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. \nKAT I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator. \nMISS PERKY The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ... \nKat smiles at her, daring her to say it. \nKAT Tempestuous? \nMISS PERKY No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often. \nShe grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition. \nMISS PERKY (continuing) You might want to work on that \nKat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor's. \nKAT As always, thank you for your excellent guidance. \nINT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY \nBianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in big flowing handwriting. \nTEACHER (0.S.) I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but I'm sure you're all doing your best. \nBianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads: \nINSERT - \"JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY GOD!\" \nChastity frowns to herself. \nTEACHER (0.S.) (continuing) Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far? \nBianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl. \nBIANCA Not really. \nThe teacher shakes her head, but lets it go. \nMANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand. \n", "test1_true": "MANDELLA Uh, yeah, I read it all \nTEACHER The whole play^ \nMANDELIA The whole folio.

The stunned teacher doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student. \nEXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY \nMandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto. \nMANDELLA \nYour sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him. She has no idea. \nKat attacks \nKAT The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me. \nKat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her staring. \nMANDELLA Who's that? \nKAT Patrick Verona   Random skid. \nMANDELLA That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies. \nKAT I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting. \nMANDELLA He always look so \nKAT Block E? \nKat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into Mandella's hand. \nKAT (continuing) Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. \nMANDELLA Just a little. \nShe eats.  Kat sees her wrist \nKAT What's this? \nMANDELLA An attempted slit. \nKat stares at her, expressionless. \nKAT I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. \nMANDELLA But imagine the things he'd say during sex. \nThinks a minute \nKAT Okay, say you do it.  You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there.

Cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them. \nCAMERON Why do girls like that always like guys like that? \nMICHAEL Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them.

I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. \nPATRICK (0. S.) Look up, sunshine \nShe does.  He's still in the tree \nPATRICK I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights. \nKAT (smiling) C'mon.  It's not that bad \nPATRICK Try lookin' at it from this angle \nShe assesses the branch structure \nKAT Put your right foot there -- \nPATRICK Forget it.  I'm stayin'. \nKAT You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? \nPATRICK (voice trembling) Maybe. \nShe sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her. \nThen swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been duped. \nKAT You shit! \nShe climbs down after him \nEXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY \nPatrick and Kat walk amongst the games \nKAT The Partridge Family? \nPATRICK I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off. \nKAT Good call. \nPATRICK So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? \nKAT I dazzled him with my wit \nShe stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID next to her and they continue walking. \nPATRICK (sarcastic) A soft side? Who knew? \nKAT Yeah, well, don't let it get out \nPATRICK So what's your excuse? \nKAT Acting the way we do. \nPATRICK Yes \nKAT I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. \nPATRICK So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? \nKAT Something like that \nPATRICK Then you screwed up \nKAT How? \nPATRICK You never disappointed me. \nShe blushes under his gaze \nPATRICK (continuing) You up for it? \nKAT For. . . ? \nHe motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game.

They land, laughing. \nIt's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to find each other's eyes. \nHe wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he goes to kiss her. \nNEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points \nKID Look, Mom \nHis mother hurries him away.

It's a stupid tradition. \nPatrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he being paid to take her. \nPATRICK People won't expect you to go... \nKat turns to him, getting angry. \nKAT Why are you doing this? \nKAT All of it -- what's in it for you? \nHe sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her suspicions. \nKAT (continuing) Create a little drama?

She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story. \nHe takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes.

Upset that I rubbed off on her? \nWALTER No -- impressed. \nKat looks up in surprise. \nWALTER (continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game. \nKAT (hopeful) When I go? \nWALTER Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

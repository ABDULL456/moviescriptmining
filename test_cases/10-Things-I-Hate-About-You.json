{"train": "Ten Things I Hate About You - by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith \nTEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU \nwritten by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith \nbased on 'Taming of the Shrew\" by William Shakespeare \nRevision November 12, 1997 \nPADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWelcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building. \nPADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY \nKAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart. \nA stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack. \nThe young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit. \nRIDER Hey -- sorry. \nCowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings. \nKAT Leave it \nHe persists. \nKAT (continuing) I said, leave it! \nShe grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school. \nINT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY \nBIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her. \nBIANCA Did you change your hair? \nCHASTITY No. \nBIANCA You might wanna think about it \nLeave the girls' room and enter the hallway. \nHALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS \nBianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both boys and girls alike. \nBOY (adoring) Hey, Bianca. \nGIRL Awesome shoes. \nThe greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans. \nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nCAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor. \nMISS PERKY I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school.  Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere. \nHer plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably. \nMISS PERKY (continuing) Any questions? \nCAMERON I don't think so, ma'am \nMISS PERKY Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got deviants to see. \nCameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is. \nMiss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick \nMISS PERKY (continuing) Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual. \nShe gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming smile. \nPATRICK I missed you. \nMISS PERKY It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls. \nPATRICK It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch. \nMISS PERKY With the teeth of your zipper? \nShe motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host. \nMICHAEL You the new guy? \nMICHAEL Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. \nThe BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside. \nMICHAEL (continuing) You know French? \nCAMERON Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada \nMICHAEL Guess who just signed up for a tutor? \nCAMERON You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? \nMICHAEL You could consecrate with her, my friend. \nCameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nKat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up beside her in his Viper. \nJOEY (re her dress) The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? \nKAT Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break. \nJOEY (practically spitting) They're running the rest of me next month. \nHe zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart. Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in a convertible. \nKAT The people at this school are so incredibly foul. \nMANDELLA You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends. \nThey watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and Chastity as they walk toward the school bus. \nON BIANCA AND CHASTITY \nJOEY Need a ride, ladies? \nBianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He pulls away with a smile. \nBACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA \nMandella lowers her sunglasses to watch. \nMANDELLA That's a charming new development \nKat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car. \nAs they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him \nKAT (yelling) Remove head from sphincter!  Then pedal! \nMichael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry at the delay. \nCameron rushes over \nCAMERON You all right? \nHe slows to a stop \nMICHAEL Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. \nCAMERON That's her?  Bianca's sister? \nMICHAEL The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. \nMichael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot. \nINT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY \nSHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. \nKat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she types. \nKAT \"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --\" \nWALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag. \nWALTER \nI hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer. \nHe grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to kiss Sharon on the cheek. \nSHARON In the microwave. \nWALTER (to Kat) Make anyone cry today? \nKAT Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty. \nCAMERON (looking down) Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night? \nBianca smiles slowly \nBIANCA You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again? \nCAMERON (embarrassed) Forget it. \nBianca seizes an opportunity. \nBIANCA No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- \nCAMERON Cameron. \nBIANCA The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does. \nCAMERON Seems like she could get a date easy enough... \nShe fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled. \nBIANCA \nThe problem is, she's completely anti-social. \nCAMERON Why? \nBIANCA Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. \nCAMERON That's a shame. \nShe reaches out and touches his arm \nBIANCA Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... \nCAMERON Let me see what I can do. \nCameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is \nINT. BIOLOGY CLASS \nA frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. Michael and Cameron go for the spleen. \nMICHAEL You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you have no concept of the high school social code? \nCameron grins away \nCAMERON I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. \nMICHAEL Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point? \nCameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog. \nCAMERON What about him? \nMICHAEL (confused) You wanna go out with him? \nThe others at the lab table raise their eyebrows \nCAMERON (impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister. \nMichael smiles.  Liking the intrigue. \nMICHAEL What makes you think he'll do it? \nCAMERON He seems like he thrives on danger \nMICHAEL No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz... \nCAMERON They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? \nMICHAEL I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. \nCAMERON Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not? \nMICHAEL Did she actually say she'd go out with you? \nCAMERON That's what I just said \nMichael processes this. \nMICHAEL You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side. \nCAMERON I thought you hated those people. \nMICHAEL Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. \nA cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee. \nCAMERON So now all we gotta do is talk to him. \nMichael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in. \nMICHAEL \nHey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. \nCameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching. \nINT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY \nKat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is smoking. \nKAT So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. \nMANDELLA William would never have gone to a state school. \nKAT William didn't even go to high school \nMANDELLA That's never been proven \nKAT Neither has his heterosexuality. \nMandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to stub out Mandella's cigarette. \nKAT (continuing) I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. (pointing at her food) Do you mind? \nMANDELLA Does it matter? \nKAT If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara.\" \nThey both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the counter to place his order. \nMandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip \nMANDELLA Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson. \nPatrick nods at them as he takes his food outside. \nKAT Janice Parker is an idiot \nINT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY \nPatrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food \nMISS PERKY (looking at chart) I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? \nPATRICK Touch of the flu. \nMISS PERKY I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence? \nHe smiles his charming smile \nPATRICK How 'bout your sex life? \nShe tolerates his comment with her withering glance. \nMISS PERKY Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? \nPATRICK What's to discuss? \nMISS PERKY You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? \nPATRICK Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... \nThe bell RINGS. \nMISS PERKY Fine.  Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week. \nINT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY \nSeveral pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks. \nMandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten \nMANDELLA Look, it's really easy. \nTREVOR You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister. \nMandella sets down her pencil and closes the book. \nMANDELLA (rotely) It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a political figure.  I do not live in South Africa.  My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries. \nTREVOR But you freed our people \nMANDELLA Your \"people\" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself. \nACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be \nBIANCA C'esc ma tete. This is my head \nPatrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up \nJOEY (continuing) Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation. \nPATRICK Fifty, and you've got your man. \nPatrick walks away with a smile \nEXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY \nKat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field. \nPatrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him. \nMR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE. \nMR. CHAPIN (proudly) Good run, Stratford. \nKat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick hops down to follow. \nPATRICK Hey. Girlie. \nKat stops and turns slowly to look at him. \nPATRICK (continuing) I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? \nKAT (smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? \nPATRICK There's a way to get a guy's attention. \nKAT My mission in life. \nShe stands there undaunted, hand on hip. \nKAT (continuing) Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked.  The world makes sense again. \nPatrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer. \nPATRICK Pick you up Friday, then \nKAT Oh, right.  Friday. \nPATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone \nPATRICK The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back. \nKAT Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? \nPATRICK I know a lot more than that \nKat stares at him. \nKAT Doubtful.  Very doubtful. \nShe walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone. \nPATRICK (calling after her) You're no bargain either, sweetheart. \nScurvy appears at his side \nSCURVY So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt. \nACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch. \nMICHAEL He took the bait. \nSTRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon. \nShe wacks Bianca away. \nBIANCA Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility. \nKat pushes past her into the hallway. \nKAT I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. \nBIANCA Can you at least start wearing a bra? \nKat SLAMS her door in response. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nPatrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit \nSCURVY You up for a burger? \nPatrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty. \nWALTER Christ!  I want a night to go by that I'm not staring a contraction in the face. \nHe walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nPatrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him. \nJOEY When I shell out fifty, I expect results. \nPATRICK I'm on it \nJOEY Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date. \nPATRICK I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. \nJoey sees through the bluff \nJOEY Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, I don't get any action.  So get your ass on hers by the end of the week. \nJoey starts to walk off \nPATRICK I just upped my price \nJOEY (turning) What? \nPATRICK A hundred bucks a date. \nJOEY Forget it. \nPATRICK Forget her sister, then. \nJoey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker, then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing scowl. \nJOEY You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona. \nPatrick takes the money with a smile. \nINT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca. \nCAMERON La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance? \nBianca glares at him. \nBIANCA A \"copine\" is someone you can count on. An \"ami\" is someone who makes promises he can't keep. \nCameron closes the French book \nCAMERON You got something on your mind? \nBIANCA I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date? \nHe melts \nCAMERON You have my word.  As a gentleman \nBIANCA You're sweet. \nShe touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back \nCAMERON (appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that? \nBIANCA Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment. \nCameron nods with interest. \nCAMERON You know, I read an article about that. \nBianca looks surprised. \nBIANCA You did? \nINT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY \nPatrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and Cameron cower in the corner, watching him. \nPATRICK (without turning around) Say it \nMICHAEL (clearing his throat) What? \nPATRICK Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say. \nCameron bravely steps forward \nCAMERON We wanted to talk to you about the plan. \nPatrick turns toward them. \nPATRICK What plan? \nJOEY Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if you won't be there. \nHe taps her on the nose and she giggles \nINT. TUTORING ROOM Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always \nBIANCA Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party? \nCAMERON Sure have. \nBIANCA (pouting) I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes. \nCAMERON I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. \nHe fishes. \nCAMERON (continuing) She's not a... \nBIANCA Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. \nCAMERON So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? \nBIANCA Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes. \nCameron furiously takes notes \nCAMERON All right.  What else is she partial to? \nINT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies. \nHe looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out. \nPATRICK Lou, it's okay.  They're with me. \nLou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our two non-deviants pass through. \nPatrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer. \nPATRICK (continuing) What've you got for me? \nCAMERON I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful. \nCameron pulls out a piece of paper. \nMICHAEL (to Patrick) \nOne question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver? \nPATRICK What?! \nMICHAEL Good enough. \nCameron looks up at Patrick. \nCAMERON Number one.  She hates smokers \nMICHAEL It's a lung cancer issue \nCAMERON Her favorite uncle \nMICHAEL Dead at forty-one. \nPatrick sits up \nPATRICK Are you telling me I'm a - (spits the word out) \"non-smoker\"? \nMICHAEL Just for now. \nCAMERON Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys. \nThis is met with silence.  Then: \nPATRICK What?  You don't think I'm pretty? \nMichael smacks Cameron \nMICHAEL He's pretty! \nCAMERON Okay!  I wasn't sure \nCameron goes back to the list. \nCAMERON (continuing) Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and \"angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion\". \nPATRICK So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments? \nMICHAEL Ever been to Club Skunk? \nPATRICK Yeah. \nINT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT \nPatrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the boy's inside pocket. \nBRUCE Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy. \nSKIPPY It's a bottle opener. \nBruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick. \nBRUCE Verona, my man. \nThey shake. \nPATRICK Always a pleasure, Brucie. \nBRUCE Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you? \nPATRICK Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in? \nBRUCE Never \nPATRICK Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? \nBRUCE Just sent 'em through. \nPatrick starts to go in \nBRUCE (continuing) Hey -- what happened to that chick you brought last time?  The one with the snake? \nPatrick laughs and goes into the club \nINT. CLUB - NIGHT \nOnstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their bad girl sass into a ripping punk number. \nNear the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR \nPatrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss finishes a song. \nLEAD SINGER Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and we're from Olympia. \nA teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream. \nBOY (0.S.) Pet my kitty! \nLEAD SINGER Meow \nThey rev into their next song. \nNEAR THE STAGE \nMandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be having a better time. \nAT THE BAR \nPatrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and Mandella singing along. \nHIS POV \nThe gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. None of her usual \"attitude\".  Patrick is transfixed.  And most definitely attracted. \nNEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella. \nKAT (shouting) I need agua! \nShe makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR \nShe made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away \nKAT (continuing to herself) Shit \nShe sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed. \nThe bartender arrives \nBARTENDER (shouting) What can I get you? \nKAT Two waters. \nShe looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she marches off, forgetting to pay. \nShe walks up to Patrick. \nKAT (continuing) You're not fooling anyone. \nPatrick looks at her, surprised \nPATRICK (yelling) hey.  Great show, huh? \nBOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a pro, handing out cigars and martinis. \nBOGEY Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the right, shots in the kitchen. \nThe house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her \nINT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJoey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and hollering within the jock crowd. \nKat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the doorway. \nJOEY Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat \nKat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his forehead. \nKAT Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede? \nHe panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's already walking away. \nJOEY Where ya goin? \nKAT Away. \nJOEY Your sister here? \nKat's face shows utter hatred \nKAT Leave my sister alone. \nJOEY (smirking) And why would I do that? \nA RUCKUS sounds from the next room \nJOCK A fight! \nThe other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash their cupfuls on each other. \nCOFFEE KID #1 That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe. \nCaffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into the kitchen. \nJOEY Just who I was looking for. \nHe puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out \nKAT BIANCA \nBianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat \nA GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts another. \nGUY Drink up, sister. \nPatrick walks up \nPATRICK What's this? \nKAT (mocking) \"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party? \nPATRICK I say, do what you wanna do. \nKAT Funny, you're the only one \nShe downs another. \nINT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and dishes dirt simultaneously. \nMICHAEL (high-fiving a jock) Moose, my man! (to Cameron) Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters have already started calling. \nCameron nods intently \nMICHAEL (continuing; grabbing his belt) Yo, Clem. (to Cameron) A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new Leanne Rimes. (with a Jamaican swagger) Ziggy, peace, bra. (to Cameron) Prefers a water pipe, but has been known to use a bong. \nMichael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, and points Cameron's body in her direction. \nMICHAEL (continuing) Follow the love, man \nON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck \nBIANCA Where did he go?  He was just here. \nCHASTITY Who? \nBIANCA Joey. \nCameron walks over. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very drunken Kat. \nKAT Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- \nBIANCA (cutting her off) I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now. \nBianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit \nINT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER \nPatrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand. \nPATRICK \nMaybe you should let me have it. \nKat is fierce in her refusal to let go \nKAT I want another one \nJoey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting him from his task. \nJOEY My man \nAs Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of dancing people in the dining room. \nPATRICK (annoyed) It's about time. \nJOEY A deal's a deal. \nHe peels off some bills \nJOEY (continuing) How'd you do it? \nPATRICK Do what? \nJOEY Get her to act like a human \nA very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. She's almost burlesque. \nOthers form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on \nShe swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her. \nThe others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up \nPATRICK Okay? \nKAT I'm fine. I'm \nShe tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs her again, bracing her. \nPATRICK You're not okay. \nKAT I just need to lie down for awhile \nPATRICK Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep \nKAT I know, just let me sleep \nPATRICK What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference... \nShe tries to sit on the floor \nKAT Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, okay? \nHe pulls her back to her \nPATRICK C'mon, let's walk \nINT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nAs Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs his arm. \nCAMERON We need to talk. \nPATRICK Cameron, I'm a little busy \nCAMERON It's off. The whole thing. \nKat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h back on her feet. \nPATRICK What 're you talking about? \nCAMERON She's partial to Joey, not me \nPatrick doesn't have time for this. \nPATRICK Cameron -- do you like the girl? \nBIANCA Dinner taste better on the way out? \nGives her a \"don't even start\" look. \nBIANCA (continuing) I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here. \nKAT You're welcome. \nShe pushes past her and leaves the bathroom. \nKAT'S CAR - NIGHT \nKat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the keys out of the ignition. \nPATRICK Cute \nBOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nKids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside Joey catches up to them. \nJOEY A bunch of us are going to Jaret's house.  Wanna come? \nChastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.

Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. \nMICHAEL Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. \nPATRICK What's the worst? \nCAMERON You get the girl. \nPatrick  thinks for a minute \nPATRICK If I go down. I'm takin' her with me \nHe motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing Patrick's absence. \nKat smiles at him. \nKAT Thank you, Mr. Chapin. \nKat bolts out the door.

I'm stayin'. \nKAT You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? \nPATRICK (voice trembling) Maybe. \nShe sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her. \nThen swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been duped. \nKAT You shit! \nShe climbs down after him \nEXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY \nPatrick and Kat walk amongst the games \nKAT The Partridge Family? \nPATRICK I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.

The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID next to her and they continue walking. \nPATRICK (sarcastic) A soft side? Who knew? \nKAT Yeah, well, don't let it get out \nPATRICK So what's your excuse? \nKAT Acting the way we do. \nPATRICK Yes \nKAT I don't like to do what people expect.

This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself. \nCAMERON Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure... \nHe mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and smacks his hand away. \nCAMERON (continuing) I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. \nBIANCA What good stuff? \nCAMERON The \"real you\". \nBIANCA Like my fear of wearing pastels? \nHe looks stricken. \nBIANCA (continuing) I'm kidding. (beat) You know how sometimes you just become this \"persona\"?  And you don't know how to quit? \nCAMERON (matter of fact) No \nBIANCA Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie. \nINT.

(with dread) Kat? \nKat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up. \nKAT Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys? \nMRS. BLAISE I'm sorry? \nKAT This book is about a guy and his fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial topic. \nThe other students roll their eyes. \nKAT (continuing) Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats. \nJOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row. \nJOEY As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends? \nA few giggles.

You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. \nKAT Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. \nMISS PERKY Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. \nKAT I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator. \nMISS PERKY The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ... \nKat smiles at her, daring her to say it. \nKAT Tempestuous? \nMISS PERKY No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often. \nShe grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition. \nMISS PERKY (continuing) You might want to work on that \nKat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor's. \nKAT As always, thank you for your excellent guidance. \nINT.

Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. \nMANDELLA Just a little. \nShe eats.  Kat sees her wrist \nKAT What's this? \nMANDELLA An attempted slit. \nKat stares at her, expressionless. \nKAT I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. \nMANDELLA But imagine the things he'd say during sex. \nThinks a minute \nKAT Okay, say you do it.  You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there.

Kat stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh \nKAT That ' s completely adorable! \nPATRICK It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? \nHe's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder. \nJOEY What's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let some little punk ass snake me. \nACROSS THE ROOM \nMichael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to Cameron and Bianca. \nMICHAEL (to Cameron) Feces hitting fan.

Let's take it easy. \nJoey turns toward Michael and Cameron. \nJOEY You two are in big trouble \nCameron faces Joey. \nCAMERON Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man. \nJoey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux \nThe various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White Rastas. \nDEREK Very uncool, my brother \nJOEY I'm not your brother, white boy. \nThe other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that they're white. \nJoey turns back to Patrick and Kat. \nJOEY (continuing) Just so you know -- she'll only spread her legs once. \nKat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him \nBIANCA That's for making my date bleed \nShe BELTS him again \nBIANCA (continuing) That's for my sister. \nAnd AGAIN \nBIANCA (continuing) And that's for me. \nCliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly. \nCOWBOY And that's for the fourth grade, asshole. \nHOTEL - NIGHT \nKAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her \nPATRICK Wait I... \nKAT You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up! \nPATRICK It wasn't like that. \nKAT Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me? \nPATRICK I didn't care about the money. \nHe catches up to her now \n", "test3_true": "She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger. \nKAT You are so not what I thought you were. \nHe grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight. \nBianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's never looked more guilty. \nINT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY \nKat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a blanket, watching \"Sixteen Candles\".  When Molly Ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial \nThe phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea. \nBIANCA Are you sure you don't want to come with us?  It'll be fun. \nKat takes the tea and gives a weak smile. \nKAT I ' m sure . \nBianca sits down next to her \nBIANCA You looked beautiful last night, you know. \nKAT So did you \nBianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his head inside. \nCAMERON She okay? \nBIANCA I hope so. \nThe door shuts behind her as Walter enters. \nWALTER Was that your sister? \nKAT Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm. \nWALTER Funny. \nWalter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with Kat. \nWALTER (continuing) I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.

Upset that I rubbed off on her? \nWALTER No -- impressed. \nKat looks up in surprise. \nWALTER (continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game. \nKAT (hopeful) When I go? \nWALTER Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check. \nKat reaches over and gives him a hug \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes from the food line. \nCAMERON (0. S.) Katarina? \nShe turns and looks at him \nCAMERON I'd like to express my apologies. \nKAT For what? \nCAMERON (looking down) I didn't mean for you to get -- When Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, I had no idea it would turn out so -- ugly.

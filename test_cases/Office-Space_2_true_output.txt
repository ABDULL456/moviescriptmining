TOM Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!! 
SAMIR Is that Tom Smykowski? 
PETER What's he doing? 
MICHAEL Oh, probably working on another heart attack. 
TOM Have you guys see this? 
He hands them a piece of paper. 
MICHAEL What? It's the staff meeting. So what? 
TOM We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech. 
SAMIR Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that? 
TOM They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year. You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency experts. You're interviewing for your own job! 
MICHAEL Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here. 
TOM I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in line with those scumbags!!! 
[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.] 
MICHAEL Shit. Shit. 
TOM You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with all this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see, that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again! 
MICHAEL I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea. 
TOM The guy made a million dollars! Y'know I had an idea like that once. 
PETER Really? What was it, Tom? 
TOM Well, all right. It was a Jump to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you couldjump to. 
MICHAEL That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom. 
SAMIR Yes, yes, it's horriblethis idea. 
TOM Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I still have a job.

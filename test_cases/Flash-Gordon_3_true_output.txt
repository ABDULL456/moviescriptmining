SOUNDS echo: hunting horns, birdcalls of TREE MEN. They start running again. 
FLASH Have we a chance, Tiger Man? 
TIGER MAN Only if we climb -- out of the green light -- to the sky -- Prince Barin's Tree Men can't follow us up there! 
FLASH What do you mean? 
TIGER MAN Ming's Law -- outside his own kingdom, every hunter becomes the hunted! 
Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out like the rungs of some great green ladder. They leap onto the lowest. 
ANGLES - THE TREE - FLASH and TIGER MAN 
Climbing. Jack and the Beanstalk, up and up, panting, but there is never a top in sight. Suddenly the branches end. 
FLASH Damn. End of the line. 
TIGER MAN reacts to something off. Touches FLASH'S shoulder and points. 
THEIR POV - AT END OF LAST BRANCH 
A crazy sort of ELEVATOR is going by. It's a moving. vine with LEAFY BASKETS attached, a vertical conveyor from the ground to above. As FLASH and TIGER MAN watch, they SEE one basket moving UP with an armed TREE MAN in it, scanning the forest below. 
FLASH 
Snatches the crossbow off TIGER MAN'S back, cocks it, notches it quickly with a GLASS ARROW from the quiver. 
INCLUDE THE TREE MAN 
hearing the CLICK of the cocking. He wheels, looks up, SEES FLASH. Letting out a fierce BIRDCALL. he jumps up and swings his own crossbow just as FLASH shoots. 
SWISH-PFFST as FLASH'S arrow hits him. ICE, he tumbles out of the basket. 
FLASH and TIGER MAN 
Run out along the branch, jump INTO the basket as it passes by. 
FLASH (CONT'D) How far will this take us? 
TIGER MAN I don't know --no man has ever been above the green. 
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE TREES (BARIN, FLASH, TREE MAN, TIGER MAN, TREE MAN LEADER) 
BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches, listening acutely. The one scouting in front calls back: 
TREE MAN The sight -- call came from the left! 
TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left: 
BARIN Up and across we'll cut them off! 
He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines. 
IN THE BASKET 
FLASH and TIGER MAN 
Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is changing, becoming less intensely green. 
TIGER MAN What is that color above? 
FLASH Blue. We call is blue.

RACHEL Zwartich. It's the way we say... dwarf. (glances at Carter) Not like him... very big. 
Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion off screen catches his attention. 
BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS 
It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's got in tow: 
BACK TO SCENE 
AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK: 
DONAHUE (to aides) Close it all down... I want a man on every exit... I want the lab in here now! (to Book) And I want to talk to you, Captain. 
ANGLE 
As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves protectively to Samuel's side. 
BOOK All right, talk. 
DONAHUE This is homicide  not Internal Affairs! So why are you behaving like you own this case? 
BOOK We were running Zenovitch... That's all I can tell you. But I want it, Terry. (then) I've got a call into Schaeffer. 
RACHEL / SAMUEL 
They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's obviously intense and angry: 
SAMUEL (alarmed) Momma... are they angry with us. 
RACHEL (reassuring, but hardly in her own mind) No... No. It is just the English way. 
Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile: 
DONAHUE You ought to think about coming back to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with Internal Affairs and you're not gonna have any friends left. 
BOOK (smiles right back) I'll buy a dog. 
EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT 
Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and opens the door. 
BOOK Go get a cup of coffee, Stan. 
The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind the wheel. 
INT. SEDAN 
Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief. 
SCHAEFFER How reliable is this kid? 
BOOK Oh, he's good. 
SCHAEFFER Amish. 
BOOK Yeah. 
SCHAEFFER What have you got? 
BOOK Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed. 
SCHAEFFER So one of them got to him. 
BOOK Maybe. 
SCHAEFFER You know who? 
BOOK Maybe. 
SCHAEFFER You're still convinced there's a link to the department? 
BOOK If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months. 
SCHAEFFER That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy. 
BOOK The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. 
SCHAEFFER When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department. 
SCHAEFFER (shakes his head) Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that. 
BOOK What's-her-name moved to Buffalo. 
SCHAEFFER (sighs) Well, anyway, don't get crazy. (dismisses him) I'll do something for Zenovich's wife. 
INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

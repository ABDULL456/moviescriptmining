(SATISFIED) I'll send you a Christmas card. 
ALEX Save the stamp. They turn into the driveway to an expensive development. 
23 EXT. SECURITY BOOTH, CORAL GABLES - DAY 
The Cadillac rolls to a stop at the ate. A tough, but amicable-looking armed guard in his forties, MIKE, opens the window of the air-conditioned booth. His RADIO is tuned to the FOOTBALL GAME. 
ALEX Hi, mike -- what's the score? 
MIKE 
(CHECKING THE 
APPOINTMENT BOARD) Dolphins down by nine, minute forty to go. It's over. 
ALEX Don't underestimate Marino. Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate. 
MIKE I told you, they don't have it this year. With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto the grounds. 
ALEX 
(YELLING BACK) â¢ Judas! Grinning, Mike routinely writes down the license plate number. 
24 EXT. CADILLAC - DAY 
Alex cruises past a collection of oversized villas, and turns into the driveway of the gaudiest. He and Jason climb out of the car. Alex opens the trunk. He loads two wine cases into Jason's arms, takes the third himself. They haven't said a word to each other. 
25 EXT. VILLA - DAY 
Alex rings the intercom with his elbow. Gabriella's VOICE CRACKLES in response. 
GABRIELLA (V.O.) on the intercom) Who is it? 
ALEX Wine delivery. The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked. Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of clean burp cloths. 
GABRIELLA Oh, the boss himself! 
ALEX (with a modest chuckle) How are you? She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting what she sees. A circuit connects between them. 
ALEX Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese. 
(TO GABRIELLA) This is my stepson, Jason. 
GABRIELLA 
(VERY CORRECT) How do you do. 
JASON Hi. 
GABRIELLA Is the wine for the boat? Come through the house. 
26 INT./EXT. VILLA - DAY 
They follow her inside. Jason takes in the richness of the place, but is more focussed on Gabriella. They exit 
TO T he lawn which leads to a dock. 
27 EXT. REESES' BOAT DAY 
A sleek, ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock, the crew unobtrusively at work. FRANK REESE, a powerful, confidant man in his mid-sixties, is sitting with his INSURANCE AGENT at a table on deck where policies are spread out next to a jewelry box. Reese's expensive 35- year-old wife DINA has turned her chair to sun her legs while she plays with the BABY. 
DINA -- what's the point of having it, if I can't wear it, Frank? 
AGENT 
(DEFERENTIALLY) You can wear it anywhere you like, Mrs. Reese -- except out of the country. Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at Dina's long legs.. She smiles. 
FRANK Alex, should we insure the wine while we're at it? His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case. 
ALEX Aren't you covered on your home policy? 
GABRIELLA 
(TO JASON) I'll show you, come on. 
AGENT How much wine are we talking about? Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck fading. 
DINA (O.S.) Why bother insuring it? Let's drink it instead. 
28 INT. BOAT - DAY 
It's quiet inside, not tasteful but impressive, like everything else of the Reeses. Jason takes a stab at conversation.

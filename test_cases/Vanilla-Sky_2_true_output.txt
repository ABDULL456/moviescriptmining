Prison. Human voices, howling like dogs. 
INT. PRISON HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
David is led down the hallway to his appointment, past many door's with thick windows and howling prisoners. Aaron pulls him along. They arrive at the Psychiatric Unit.. McCabe is visible, standing, deep in thought through the door. 
INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY -      (INTERROGATION # 3) 
McCabe holds his drawings, standing. David is seated. 
MCCABE I see you haven't been wasting your time. Do you ever draw anything else? All the drawings are of Sofia, drawn in a similar fashion. David is a little jumpy, a little amped. He moves to the window. The yard is filled with prisoners. 
DAVID No. 
MCCABE Did you sleep last night.? 
DAVID No. I did not sleep. 
MCCABE I've got to leave early today, so you'll have to be brief. Now. What can you tell me about the name "Ellie?" 
DAVID Ellie? 
MCCABE Is that a girl you knew? A girl you were in love with? 
DAVID I've only been in love once. 
MCCABE Apparently, you kept repeating it last night. You did sleep, David, and your advisor said you cried out, you had a nightmare. 
DAVID Everything is a nightmare -- 
MCCABE You cried out for "Ellie," David. Do you remember what happened? 
DAVID No... no... 
MCCABE Dig deep, David. Dig deep. You cried out for Ellie. What do you remember about Ellie? Show me your face, David. Help me. Open the door. David rises and goes to the prison window. ANGLE ON McCABE In powerful framing, lower shot capturing him powerfully. 
MCCABE (digging deeper', aching to help) It's true you had an accident. It's true you were disfigured, but not anymore. Do you remember?! (with certainty) They did fix your face. Take off that mask, David. You'll see your face is perfect under there. 
DAVID I never trusted the Doctors. What happened next was surreal. That same arrogant bastard, Dr. 
Pomeranz, called me and suddenly he was my new best friend. 
SHOT OF DR. POMERANZ friendly with outstretched hand, standing in front of x- rays 
DR. POMERANZ (warmly) David! Hey, my brother. I felt. really bad about our last conversation. 
CLOSE ON DAVID 
DAVID He'd discovered a new form of reconstructive surgery, with the help of a doctor from Berlin. 
ON DOCTOR FROM BERLIN who bows to camera. 
DOCTOR FROM BERLIN Hello. 
CLOSE ON DAVID - CONTINUED 
DAVID The next thing I knew they shot me full of drugs I'd never heard of and away we went.

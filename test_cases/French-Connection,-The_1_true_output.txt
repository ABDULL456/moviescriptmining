EXT. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY - MOSHOLU EXIT 
A long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above Harlem River Drive in Washington Heights.  Sprayed along the face of the cliff is a disaster -- an overturned city bus and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers. There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer approaches SIMONSON with a set of heroin works. 
OFFICER (to SIMONSON) This belonged to the kid who was drivin' the sports car.  17 years old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the car.  We found this set of works in her arm. 
Medium close shot of DOYLE and SIMONSON.  DOYLE couldn't care if Rome was burning on the hill; he's only interested in his case. 
DOYLE (to MULDERIG) Where the hell was the surveillance? "Go to bed." That's all you could say.  You couldn't keep track of a bleeding elephant in a snowbank. 
SIMONSON, eyes on the hill, glancing to DOYLE with irritation. 
SIMONSON Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore. If there was a deal it must have gone down by now.  We blew it!  We blew our cover and we blew the warrants -- 
MULDERIG Charnier and his wife checked out of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked out of the Edison -- 
RUSSO This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop. 
DOYLE I say we keep sittin' on Boca. 
MULDERIG That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now. 
DOYLE Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way. 
MULDERIG With pleasure -- it's all yours. Walter, if anything develops outta this charade give me a call. 
Medium shot of SIMONSON, DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO.  Lights flashing around them; stretchers going by with bodies. 
RUSSO (to MULDERIG) My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers. 
DOYLE (to SIMONSON) This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it. 
SIMONSON 
SIMONSON For chrissake, will you come off that "my case" bullshit.  This has been a whore's dream from the start. 
DOYLE, close. 
DOYLE The deal hasn't gone down yet Walter -- I know it, I can feel it. 
Close shot of MULDERIG 
MULDERIG The last time you were dead certain we ended up with a dead cop. 
A fist, DOYLE's, comes from off-camera and connects with MULDERIG's chin.  As his head flies back. 
DOYLE and MULDERIG slugging and grappling with each other, RUSSO leaping in to yank them apart.  SIMONSON grabbing MULDERIG's arm and holding him back. 
SIMONSON, close. 
SIMONSON (roaring) That's enough.  Get the hell out of here. 
DOYLE 
Shot of SIMONSON, MULDERIG, DOYLE, RUSSO, in a cluster. 
SIMONSON (on way up hill, turning back) Jimmy, you wasted two months - no collars are comin' in while you two been out jerkin' off.  Now go back to work, you're off Special Assignment. 
EXT. LA GUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY 
Medium close side view of SAL BOCA's Mercury pulling to the Washington-Boston shuttle parking lot at La Guardia airport. SAL takes his ticket from the automatic vendor and drives in. We hold for the next car driven by PHIL KLEIN, a federal narcotics agent who is on his tail. 
INT. AIRPORT - DAY 
Medium close shot of SAL BOCA writing out the ticket order form. 
Close shot of the form; SAL filling it out in an almost illiterate scrawl.  Under destination SAL fills in Washing... and the camera raises its eye to a close shot of PHIL KLEIN on the opposite side of the counter, filling in his form.

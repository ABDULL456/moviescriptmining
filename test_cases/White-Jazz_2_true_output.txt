BRADLEY -that makes one of us. 1284 South                         * Tremaine. (MORE) 
BRADLEY (cont'd) (edge to his voice) This kind of timing makes for disasters, Lieutenant. 
I hear the first split-second of Bradley smashing his phone down. Click my own cradle. Wipe my face. Dial another number. 
ME Junior. Meet me at 1284 South                         * Tremaine. 20 minutes. 
17   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - LATE NIGHT 17 
Police abound. Mostly work-a-day Blues pounding coffee. They part as I approach: Dave "Enforcer" Klein half-legend here. A plain-clothes breaks through, aims right at me: DAN WILHITE. 
ME (V.O.) Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan Catholic poisoned by 25 years in this desert. Recently divorced despite seven kids with his Ex. 
WILHITE Why are you here? 
ME You smell like bourbon Wilhite- 
WILHITE -fuck off. This is handled. And pull your idiot partner out of there- 
ME -Junior's already here- 
WILHITE -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's my scene. 
-push past him, toward the house. 
ME Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay that order. I'm here on his word. Now, what happened? 
WILHITE (dragged out of him) Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's missing. 
ME And presumed what? 
WILHITE I could give a shit. I just want to this case to get a quick burial. 
ME I'll bet. Who made the call? 
WILHITE Some old broad heard an `argument' and buzzed Wilshire Station.                * 
ME Where's the family? 
WILHITE The wife and daughter were in Santa Barbara. Just got back. 
ME (check my Hamilton) At 2 AM?                                    * 
WILHITE                           * The Wife said she got into a fight          * with her Parents, left ASAP.                * 
ME                                * Why wasn't Hector with `em?                 * 
WILHITE What do you think they were                 * fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         * don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks. 
ME What about the Son?                         * 
WILHITE (sneering hatred) Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect. 
ME Why's that?                                 * 
WILHITE He's got a mean streak. And he and          * Hector had been at each others throats for months. Have Tommy              * picked up. He likes to loaf at              * those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          * 
ME Alright, you better cut out before                      * people start asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons. 
Wilhite gets close, still sneering: 
WILHITE Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and pin this thing fast or you'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door. 
ME What are you talking about Wilhite? 
WILHITE You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe by killing that boxer   and they already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   * Bradley sent you down   here as damaged goods...think   about it. Everybody sees what's   coming. (beat, closer) Now close this quick. 
Wilhite bolts. I pause. Clarity finally dissolving the            * bloodshot: this is the disaster Bradley was talking about:        * 
ME (V.O.) The God-sized problems I triggered tossing Sanderline take shape: the LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy                       * spot to stick a new probe.                              * 
18   INT. MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER                     18 
All money, no taste. In the foyer: a Wilshire Station six- pack interviews the old BIDDIE in a threadbare bathrobe. Dyed orange hair and a burnt-butter grin. Leans-lunges as she relays her story. I zoom in to catch the performance. 
BIDDIE (mid-sentence) -shifty...colored...y'know Negros are planning an invasion! After our white women and our water supply- 
OFFICER -where was this Peeper you saw?

A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire. A bird rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings. Widening, we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance. 
Union Station now looks more like Grand Central. A huge granite facade, a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the corners. Here, in the flow of figures, we make out Lincoln and Ester, resembling tourists. Then, a short distance behind, we spot two more figures. The hobo and his timorous dog. Following. 
112   INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY 
V a u l t e d . Arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. Sunlight falls in filtered shafts. Footfalls echo off polished granite. Lincoln and Ester scan around. Ester looks daunted by the space. Lincoln looks focused. He sees people in line, transacting. 
113   INT . TICKET WINDOW - DAY The sign on the window reads "Tickets". Lincoln assimilates. The word is familiar. He steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET CLERK - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy smile. Lincoln offers her the blue card. She seems not to notice. 
T H E TICKET CLERK We l c o m e to Phoenix Union Station. What is your date of travel, sir? 
Lincoln has to think. Dates mean nothing to him. He ventures- 
LINCOLN Now... 
T H E TICKET CLERK An d what is your destination? 
LINCOLN O u t of state. 
T H E TICKET CLERK I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? 
LINCOLN We want to go out of state. 
T H E TICKET CLERK I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? 
V O I C E (O.S.) L i k e talking to a wall, ain't it? 
Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The interceder is pale, bald, wearing leathers. A stranger to them, we recognize him as DIGGS- 
DIGGS H o l o s e r v e . C h e a p e r than flesh and blood but nothing between the ears. 
Diggs demonstrates, wafting his hand across the ticket counter. It cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple. 
DIGGS F i r s t time I used one of these, I asked her out on a date... 
He grins genially, examining their faces, verifying his quarry. Lincoln examines the pale man. The sense of danger is welling- 
LINCOLN What do you want? 
DIGGS J u s t wanted to help, that's all. D i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy per the mandate. Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed, makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio- 
D I G G S (INTO RADIO) B u r d i e , it's them. East exit. 
114   EXT . TERMINAL - DAY 
Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow of figures. Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back. The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up. Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them, kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a "cutter", it's a common sight on the streets. The driver leans out of the window - hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize BURDON- 
BURDON You folks need a ride? 
Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The dark giant is just another stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant. The sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. Burdon sugars the way- 
BURDON P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge... 
He taps a button and the side-door slips open. Lincoln looks into the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. Ester, hugging close, nervous. Figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. The dark giant, looking on expectantly. The pause stretching, then- 
VOICE (O.S.) He y ! What the fuck are you doing, man? B a c k down the colonnade, THE HOBO is gesticulating to Burdon- 
T H E HOBO I told you! They went inside! 
The hobo doesn't see Lincoln and Ester, unwitting that he's just betrayed himself as their shadow... and Burdon as their predator. His dog starts barking. Lincoln starts backing away with Ester, his eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the giant's face dropping, the elements converging... They bolt. 
BURDON Shit! 
B U R D O N JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a parked vehicle - he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece- 
B U R D O N (INTO RADIO) N o r t h Corner! North Corner! 
LINCOLN AND ESTER RACE UP THE COLONNADE - against the flow of figures - darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream -- 
D I G G S BURSTS FROM THE NORTH EXIT - launching up the north side of the terminal - thinner foot traffic here, faster going -- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER SLOWING - the flow massing under the portico - they peel through - the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead -- 
D I G G S TURNING THE NORTH CORNER - pausing to touch his earpiece - now launching south down the colonnade - towards the portico - jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt, ready for the snatch-- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER GAINING PACE - past the portico now, the way opening - Lincoln's eyes flaring - a face in the distance ahead - the pale man - he swings Ester around - doubling back to find -- B U R D O N COMING UP BEHIND - the flow of figures, no obstacle - parting at his thunderous onset - his quarry, stopped and staring at him - almost upon them - handcuffs at the ready-- 
LINCOLN FREEZES - caught between the dark giant and the pale man - Ester cringing to his side - the dark giant charging up on them - sunlight on metal - the sight of the handcuffs - TRIGGERING HIM-- 
LINCOLN GRABS ESTER - swinging her off the sidewalk - lowering her into the lodeway - leaping down to join her - lode poles pulsing, thrumming - rivets on their denims, rattling from the polarity - traffic soaring past on lode-stream, chest-high - 
DARTING OUT INTO TRAFFIC - Lincoln leads Ester by the hand like a child - across the lanes, dodging, weaving through the gaps - claxons b l a r i n g , deafening - sunflashes, blinding - a sudden shadow - a huge freight truck bearing down, no gaps ahead -- 
LINCOLN DRAGS ESTER TO THE GROUND - both flattening against the concrete lode-bed - the shadow engulfing them - the truck's hull runners shearing narrowly over their heads - the rush of air, sweeping off Lincoln's ballcap - rousing a storm of dust-- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER CHOKING - crawling onward through the dust - hull runners scudding overhead - maybe only a foot of clearance - buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire - onwards, crawling across the concrete - fighting their way across the lode-stream--

PRIDEAUX (Quietly) Got your specs on Jumbo? 
ROACH Yes, sir. 
PRIDEAUX Who's the fellow down there? 
Roach stares at the stranger eagerly. 
ROACH (Disappointed) Don't know sir. 
PRIDEAUX Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? (MORE) 
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...? 
CLASS (By rote) Best car in England! 
They dissolve into laughter, but Roach is still anxiously watching Prideaux, noting how his expression has darkened. 
153   OMITTED                                                     153 
154   INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - POOL TABLE - DAY               154 
Belinda, the deb we met earlier, is doing up her blouse. She's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her. 
BELINDA Stop it! Stop it! 
KASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight escalating as others join in the struggle. 
KASPAR Keep your bloody hands off her! 
He kicks at Guillam, who falls. Belinda gives a shriek of alarm. 
SCALPHUNTER Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt! 
Guillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief. Job done. 
155   EXT. CASINO - DAY                                           155 
Bright morning sunshine. Smiley and Guillam walk up concrete steps of a casino building - very modern, imposing. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Haven't seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact. 
156   INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - DAY                           156 
Smiley, Guillam and the genial JERRY WESTERBY are sat at a blackjack table. The casino is empty, a cleaner vacuums in the background. 
JERRY WESTERBY But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff. 
He points to a drink on the table before him. 
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) (An old joke between them) Too much wampum not good for braves. How. 
SMILEY (Obliging) How. (Beat) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you? 
Westerby looks at them both. 
JERRY WESTERBY Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him. 
157   INT. CIRCUS - EVENING - PAST                               157 
Westerby walks down the corridor. We pass OFFICES - drawers pulled open, waste paper bins standing on desks - the end of day ritual. 
158   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                   158 
Westerby is following a horse race on the radio. A dirty plate in front of him. He drinks from a can of beer. 
159   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                    159 
Westerby is asleep. The Circus is deathly quiet, nothing stirring. Then... 
A PHONE BEGINS TO RING. 
160   INT. CIRCUS - CONTROL'S OFFICE - NIGHT                      160 
Control sits surrounded by files. A dim green lamp on his desk the only illumination. He looks ill, tense with waiting. Cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray. 
He listens to the solitary PHONE below him in the building. Then it is joined by a SECOND. Then a THIRD... 
Control listens, nerves stretched to their limit. From just outside - the sound of someone running up the wooden staircase. A knock. 
JERRY WESTERBY (Entering) Been a bit of a panic, sir. 
Control raises his head. 
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) From the FO resident clerk... A Hungarian news bulletin, sir. (Reading) British spy, work-name Ellis, travelling with false Hungarian papers, has attempted to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian general in Budapest. He's been shot, other arrests imminent... 
Control stares at him, stands unsteadily, begins to put on his coat. 
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) Can I have a brief, please? Sir? Do you want me to deny it?

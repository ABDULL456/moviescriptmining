His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees RACHEL standing over him. He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it. RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold, splashing into the pool. But she jolts on two... 
GUNSHOTS RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired. She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood. MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers. He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring, and turns. A POOL COVER starts to unfold. At that moment... 
RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool. 
UNDERWATER -- As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting out the light from above. MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but the POOL COVER blocks his escape. He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as his feet kick to keep him afloat. 
ON THE SURFACE -- The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg, slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts. 
M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing. 
BARBARA (O.S.) Rachel! A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA. RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared little girl reaching for her mother. 
RACHEL Mama. Maury? BARBARA'S P.O.V. o but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos. BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, reaching for her. Mama, please. BARBARA blinks and it's now... The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos. She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror. 
BARBARA What are you? You're not my little girl. No. The devil's in you. 
RACHEL 
(CRYING) Don't leave me, mama. But her mother disappears into the shadows. 
RACHEL Please, I don't have... anyone. She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT. 
RACHEL Please, God, let me die... And she tightly shuts her eyes. 
DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
THE LIVING ROOM A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies. The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward... JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head and starts in fear as... o the center of the room, facing him. He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her gaze to... 
THE TV SET with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying 
ON JESS He looks back at her. 
JESSE Rachel, listen. I swear, d know they were taping us. d never hurt you. She looks at his pleading eyes. 
JESSE 
I LOVE-- The TV SET now has the video footage of... 
INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT 
JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He gently runs his fingers across her brow. 
JESSE 
(SOFTLY) I love you . And oulls her closer. 
HACK TO -- - RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays.. ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while she was asleep. 
RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She turns back to JESSE, amazed. A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her. 
JESSE 
(COUGHS) Rachel. Gat out, now. Go. And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him. He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over to hear. She whispers again... 
RACHEL .love you. JESSE tenderly kisses her lips. And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body Love. Her face is serene. JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's nightmare. JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter open. 
RACHEL Leave. Get out Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate. RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH... 
EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

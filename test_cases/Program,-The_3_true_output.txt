Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches like a hawk. 
SWANN (to his cameraman) We ready, Jerry? O.K., let's mark it. 
An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe. 
SWANN Joe, this game is being billed as a potential "Heisman Shootout". Did you feel any added pressure this week... 
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY 
A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as Joe goes through passing drills. 
SWANN (V.O.) ...knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen? 
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY, THE PRESENT AGAIN 
JOE Well, ya know, you try to block it out, but it's basically impossible... Everybody seems to be talkin' about it, all the newspapers, the interviews... 
INT. T.V. STUDIO - NIGHT 
Joe is being interviewed by DALLAS PERRY on a local television show. 
JOE (V.O.) The hype on T.V., tryin' to get somethin' goin... 
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN 
Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera, waves off the take. 
BRAVER Hold it! Hold it! 
SWANN What?! What's the problem? 
Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially. 
BRAVER What you're saying is true, of course, but I don't think it's the message you want to send. 
INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT 
Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape. 
BRAVER (V.O.) It makes you seem a little nervous. Like the pressure might be getting to you. 
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN 
BRAVER This game is nationally televised, so most Heisman voters will be watching. I think a more casual approach is better. Modest, controlled, casual. 
Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera. 
SWANN (to Braver, irritated) We all set now? (gets a nod) Let's mark it. (the take is marked) Joe, this game is being billed as a potential "Heisman Shootout." 
EXT. E.S.U. QUAD - NIGHT 
A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium. 
SWANN (V.O.) Did you feel any added pressure this week, knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen? 
The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe", they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly embarrassed by it all. 
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN 
JOE No, I don't really think too much about that kinda thing. 
Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look. 
EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT 
Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad tracks below. Neither says anything. Joe seems strangely preoccupied. Camille decides to break the silence. 
CAMILLE Your parents comin' to the game tomorrow? 
JOE My mom's dead. My dad has never seen me play. 
CAMILLE Why not? 
JOE Guess he's not that interested in football.

(0050 PRO) PROLOGUE 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE ALLEY - NIGHT 
Lightning strikes, illuminating a vine covered wall as the camera moves across a dark alley filled with CARDBOARD BOXES and CRATES. They boxes have stylized LABELS; the box in front is labeled FOCUS FEATURES. 
SFX: FOOTSTEPS running on cobblestones and LABORED BREATHING. 
HERBERT (O.S.) No. Not my boy! 
Lightning strikes again, highlighting the boxes and rubbish in the alley. Something is coming. Whatever it is, its breath is hurried and animalistic. 
SFX: A BABY CRIES out. 
Stumpy CLAWED FEET wrapped in rag run past a boxed labeled LAIKA. The camera follows the shadowed figure as it runs along cobblestones to the end of the lane. The creature pauses under an arched entryway and turns, revealing GLOWING EYES, a large mouth full of wonky teeth, and a BABY SHAPED BUNDLE in its arms. 
LIGHTING CRASHES as the BABY wriggles and cries. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CLOSE ON: A FIST pounds a door. 
SNATCHER (WHEEZING) Wake his lordship. 
SFX: A SERIES OF LOCKS being unlatched on the door. 
A BUTLER opens the double doors, frowns. He starts to close the doors but Snatcher pushes against the effort. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) The unspeakable has happened. (GASP) We must speak of it immediately! 
A voice calls out from behind them. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) (TIRED) What is it, Snatcher? 
The butler moves aside, revealing a regal man with a white hat at the top of an ornate marble staircase. 
INT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND looks on from the mezzanine. The man in the red hat casts a long shadow across the gleaming checkered floors of the Cheese Guild. 
SNATCHER (GESTURING THEATRICALLY) Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child. 
CLOSE ON: Lord Portley-Rind, perfectly groomed and perfectly horrified. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (AGHAST) No. 
CLOSE ON: ARCHIBALD SNATCHER in the door, backlit by streetlights, sheets of rain falling behind him. He's a big man, but out of shape (all belly and no butt), with long shreds of greasy hair sprouting from beneath his crooked hat. 
SNATCHER (NODS) They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND A horrible tragedy. (beat, flippant) Let's deal with it in the morning! 
Portley-Rind turns to go. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) STOP! 
The Butler closes the door, but Snatcher shoves his foot in the way. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (STRUGGLING) Oh, oof! That's not the worst of it! Next they'll come after... 
The Butler shoves at the door, slapping and shoving Snatcher's face until the door slams shut. Snatcher opens the mail slot and yells through it. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) ...OUR CHEESES! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (GASP) My Gouda!? 
SNATCHER (LOW) They'll stop at nothing. 
Portley-Rind suddenly flings open the doors, stares wide eyed at Snatcher. He is crouched on the ground near the mail slot. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes. 
Snatcher stands slowly. 
SNATCHER Oh, I don't want money. 
He steps into the house and into the light, REVEALING his greedy face for the first time. He smiles an oily smile. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I want one of those. 
Snatcher points to the WHITE HAT on Portley-Rind's head. Lord Portley-Rind grabs his hat protectively. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND A White Hat? You?! Absurd! 
Snatcher turns to leave, moving towards the damp Market Square. 
SNATCHER Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your...

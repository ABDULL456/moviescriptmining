NOL AS BENVOLIO (to ROMEO) "Away, be gone, the sport is at best." 
VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the curtain at the gap. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
WILL is kissing her hand. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss, dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the general backstage area. 
SAM AS JULIET (O.S.) "Come hither nurse. What is yond gentleman?" 
VIOLA (to Will) Oh let it be night! 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
RALPH AS NURSE "I know not." 
SAM AS JULIET "Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
"JULIET'S" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls away. 
VIOLA Oh, do not go 
WILL I must. I must 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
As WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the rehearsal can be heard continuing. 
RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.) "His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy." 
ALLEYN (O.S.) (roaring from the audience) Terrible! 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. 
WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all over the table. We take a peak at the lines he has already written. INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun." VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line. 
VIOLA (VO) "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!" 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. 
VIOLA (reading) "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she" 
VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) Oh, Will! 
WILL Yes, some of it is speakable. 
She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with the pages. 
VIOLA (continuing reading) "It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!" 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony above her. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek. 
SAM AS JULIET (above) "Ay me." 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "She speaks. 
Oh speak again bright angel" 
We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. 
WILL (reading through VIOLA'S kisses) "Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name."

HOSPITAL PORTER Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down the hall that could use ... 
DAVID Wait a minute .... (about to get tough again) 
ALISON Please. It's okay.      Really. (to David) Wow - who put the fire in you, my' man? 
CUT TO: 
INT.   HOSPITAL.   JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
JENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at the SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, "How can I get this working again? How can I help?" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G. machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea. 
He yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
DAVID, ALISON and KEVIN walk back towards the room. 
ALISON Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. 
DAVID Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. 
She and DAVID manage to share a smile. They're going to get through this. Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room. KEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it. 
DAVID I thought you said.... CUT TO: 
INT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY 
The LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity to horror. 
BEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's E.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing Jennifer's faint vital signs ... 
ALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room. 
DAVID Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you hear me? Come on now... 
But BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer. DAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT TO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ... 
DAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his sword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the monitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start. 
JENNIFER Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom? 
ALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs. 
DAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter. JENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy. 
KEVIN I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do not lie! 
ALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN. 
MIX THROUGH TO: 
INT.   LEARY HOUSE.     KITCHEN.   NIGHT. 
ALISON is fixing some coffee.       DAVID enters. 
DAVID Here, let me do that. 
ALISON No, I'm fine. 
He just stands there. 
okay - you grind the beans, and 
He moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist. 
... put them in the .... ( but she can't concentrate I don't believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband. 
Pause. They are just about to kiss when BEAN enters. He's a bit impatient. 
BEAN Ahm - excuse me ... ( POINTING TO HIS WATCH ) You know.. 
They jump apart.      The moment is gone. 
ALISON Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready. 
ALISON takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots. 
ALISON There.     Is that how you like them?

{"train": "Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene. \nSAM Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette. (to the cops) Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor. \nArt and the detectives shake hands. \nART So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life? \nSAM I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie. \nGloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back. \nRAY I've got that two o'clock in town. \nGLORIA (nodding) Back to the land of grownups. \nThe detectives shake hands once more with San and Art. \nSAM (to Gloria) If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. \nGLORIA (smiling) I'd like that. \nRay opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it. \nArt claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway. Sam remains near the doors, watching as... \nANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL \nRay and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus, which they get into and drive away. \nEXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER \nCheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks. \nANGLE ON DOCKS \nAs the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets about tying off the boat. \nSam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder. \nSAM (loud enough to be heard by his class) Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil those dock lines and I'll see you all on Monday. \nHe watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky. \nEXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER \nhosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as... A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake. \nJIMMY All right.  I could party on that. \nSam just laughs at him. \nSAM That's about all it's good for. (beat) That's the one to have. \nHe points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail. \nSAM The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that one summer. (beat) Long time ago. \nHe pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line. \nJIMMY You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... \nSAM Hey, you're working for it. (beneath a laugh) Least you're supposed to be. \nHe tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam. \nVOICE (O.S.) Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys? \nSam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam with a coy smile. \nKELLY So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo? (off Sam's blank look) The senior car wash, remember? (beat) Tamara's making a schedule.  She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list. \nSam smiles, remembering. \nSAM Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think? \nSam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then. \nKELLY Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I do it?  We're working as a team. \nSam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes. \nSAM Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off. \nKELLY Deal. (beat) You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? \nSam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school. \nKELLY (CONT'D) You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen. \nSam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain. \nEXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT \nKelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge stone house, where... \nA YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows. \nKelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.  Slowly, she raises the gun, pointing at the yellow window. \nShe holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself... \nKELLY Bang... \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY \nSunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big, buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is near, as... \nA cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore it.  No dice.  Sandra groans, finally pulling away. \nSANDRA Goddamnit! (she answers) Hello. \nCOMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Hello, this is the attendance office at Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter is absent today, Monday... \nSANDRA Jesus H. Christ! \nShe hangs up hard.  Sits on the edge of the bed. \nFRANKIE What? \nSandra waves him off.  She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the phone once more, punching in a number. \nINT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY \nDesk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with \"Sam Lombardo -- Blue Bay Educator of the Year.\" \nSam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers. \nSAM Counseling. \nXNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION \nSandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her. \nSANDRA Sam, Sandy Van Ryan. \nFrankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word \"Sam.\" \nIn his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer, stiffening noticeably. \nSAM Sandy... What's up? \nSANDRA Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her? \nSAM No. \nSANDRA Shit. Here we go again. \nSAM Didn't you see her this morning? \nSANDRA To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday. \nBOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps. BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside. \nSANDRA'S POV - KELLY \nstands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them high above the water. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSANDRA (CONT'D) Never mind.  I found her. (a long beat) Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the other day. (beat) I haven't found anyone else can handle the Jonathan like you can. \nShe glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room. \nSam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank, unblinking eyes. \nSANDRA (CONT'D) Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what? \nSAM So maybe I'm a one-woman man. \nSandra laughs. \nSANDRA Right. (beat) You really think you're gonna get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you? \nSandra pauses to laugh once more. \nSANDRA (CONT'D) Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts. \nSAM Goodbye, Sandra. \nSam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the barest hint of a smile plays upon his face. \nSandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek racing sloop floating beyond the private dock. \nSANDRA (V.O.) My daughter does not get raped in Blue Bay! \nINT. STATION HOUSE - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nSandra slams a fist on the conference table. \nKelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander Haig look. \nSeated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER, the local D.A. \nSilence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands. \nRAY (in a quiet voice) You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. \nSANDRA That's right. \nRay and Gloria exchange looks.  Gloria in particular looks slightly stunned. \nGLORIA The guidance counselor at Blue Bay? \nSANDRA (sarcastically) The guidance counselor at Blue Bay. \nGLORIA We understand your feelings, Ms. Van Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time with Kelly.  We'd like to take her statement alone. \nBaxter nods, yes.  Sandra looks at Kelly. \nSANDRA Are you okay for this? \nKelly nods. \nSANDRA (CONT'D) The man must be insane to think he can do this to me... \nTom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then. \nGloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is very calm and quiet. \nGLORIA How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? \nKELLY (shaking her head) I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it. \nGLORIA I know you do. \nShe waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod. \nGLORIA (CCNT'D) We'd like to videotape the statement if that's all right with you. \nKelly shrugs. \nGLORIA (CONT'D) I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But these are serious charges and we need to know everything that happened between you and Mr. Lombardo. (beat) Are you ready? \nKelly nods. \nCLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT \nKELLY He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said must be sore after washing cars.  I... let him  I mean he's a nice guy. (beat) I don't know... It was so fast.  I closed my eyes.  I remember his hands moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a second it was nice... I forgot whore I was.  I mean he's so gorgeous... \nPULL BACK to REVEAL... \nINT. STATION HOUSE - DAY \nRay, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape. \nBACK TO VIDEOTAPE \nKELLY The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers... \nGLORIA (O.S.) Take your time. \nKELLY They were in me.  Both places... you know. \nGLORIA (O.S.) I understand. \nKELLY He said something like, \"Do you want it dirty7\" or something. (beat) I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor. \nGLORIA (O.S.) Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you? \nKELLY Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me... \nGLORIA (O.S.) (as Kelly breaks into tears) That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine. (beat) But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you? \nKELLY No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know... \nGLORIA (O.S.) He was large? \nKelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off. \nGLORIA (O.S., CONT'D) Did you try to fight him? \nKELLY I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.' \nGLORIA (O.S.) Then what? \nSAM That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on Monday. \nJimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.  Sam waves him off. Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass. \nSAM (CONT'D) (to Art, nodding after Jimmy) What's left of my sailing class. \nArt studies the dock between his feet. \nSAM (CONT'D) Talk to me Artie. \nART Kelly Van Ryan... \nSAM ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know... \nART Sam... I... (a long beat) Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension... \nSAM This is insane. \nArt shakes his head. \nART All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay... \nSAM That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit. (beat) I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it. \nART The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle. (beat) You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one. \nEXT. STRIP MALL - DAY \nTypical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  \"KEN BOWDEN -- ATTORNEY AT LAW.\" \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nSam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine. \nAn attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam, favoring him with a flirtatious smile. \nSECRETARY Mr. Bowden will see you now. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nKen Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand. \nKEN Sam, hey, it's been a while. (beat) Looked for you at the ten year reunion. You missed out.  Three days at the Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves silly. \nSam nods. \nKEN (CONT'D) Couple of your old flames were there. You remember Jill, with the knockers. \nKen holds his hands out in front of his chest. \nKEN (CONT'D) Blew up like the Goodyear blimp. \nSam forces a smile. \nKEN (CONT'D) But check this... \nSAM (interrupting) Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here. \nKen stops, puts on a serious face. \nKEN Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry. (folding his hands before him) Why don't you tell me about it. \nSam looks at him.  He starts to speak, then checks himself. \nSAM What did you do to your neck? \nKen puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the first time. \nKEN Oh this... chiropractor did a number on me. \nHe takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk. \nKEN (CONT'D) I don't really have to wear the thing all the time. (beat) A guy from the insurance was here. \nKen smiles.  Sam looks slightly ill. \nKEN (CONT'D) Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what we've got here. \nEXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nTrendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep. \nINT. RESTAURLNT - SAME \nSam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at the maitre d'. \nSAM Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She here yet? \nGEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it. He scans the room... \nANGLE ON ROOM \nSam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face. \nKEN I figured, you know, it would be darker in here. \nHe moves a hand to his face. \nSAM Good thinking. \nKEN You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... \nSAM Forget it. \nKEN Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying. \nSAM I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank? \nHe pauses to look at Ken Bowden. \nSAM (CONT'D) Can't you take that stupid thing off? \nKEN Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes. \nSan sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat. \nKEN (CONT'D) You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why. (beat) Sandra Van Ryan. \nSAM What's that supposed to mean? \nKEN For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared. (beat) And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless. \nKen reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read. \nSAM Nellie Gail Ranch... \nKEN Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp. (beat) Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. (beat) Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right. \nSAM There's nothing for them to get. \nKEN Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. (beat) They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution... \nSAM I just want my life back... \nKEN Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement. \nINT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nEveryone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam. \nRAY Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house. \nSAM (with growing impatience) Story's the same, Detective... \nKen pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a calmer voice, calm but tired. \nSAM (CONT'D) I had to go look for this coupon. \nRAY The one you bought at school. \nSAM (nodding) Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. (beat) Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly. \nRAY In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt. \nSAM Yes. \nRAY And she wanted to talk. \nSAM Yes. \nRAY But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about. \nSAM I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place. \nRAY And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her. \nSAM Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office. \nGLORIA And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? \nSAM Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab. \nRAY But she ran away. \nSAM That's right. \nGLORIA Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons? \nSAM No. \nGLORIA Weren't you a little worried about her...? \nSAM There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office. \nRAY Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now. \nGloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway and onto a narrow dirt road. \nA sign pokes out from the tall grass -- \"SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP.\" \nThe Taurus bounces along the washboard road. \nGLORIA You're sure we're not lost? \nThey are driving now at the edge of a canal. \nRAY You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay? \nGLORIA The skinny brunette. \nRAY This is where she lives.  She wants to talk. (beat) Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine. \nGLORIA You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. \nRay gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs. \nGLORIA (CONT'D) That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place. \nRAY It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do? \nThey pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run of shabby trailers and cheap shacks. \nThe squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished brass beneath an immense, darkening sky. \nRay parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and peeling paint.  A sign reads:  \"NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET.\"  The jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves. \nAs they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye -- along the bank of the canal... \nANGLE ON BANK \nwhere a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws. \nWalter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a hollow snapping sound. \nGloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth. \nVOICE (0.5.) He's just showin' off for you now. \nGloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips. \nBefore Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than. \nRAY Evening Ruby. (beat) I see you still got Walter.  I was sort of hoping something had eaten him by now. \nRUBY (a long beat) Can I help you with something? \nRay and the old lady look at each other. \nRAY Suzie called.  You know where we can find her? \nRuby looks toward the store. \nRUBY You know the way. \nShe watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them as they start up the steps. \nRUBY (CONT'D) You won't shoot her will you?  I don't believe she's armed. \nGloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare, then opens the door for Gloria. \nINT. CAMP STORE - SAME \nIt's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up black-and-white TV. \nTwo elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old couch watching reruns of \"Family Feud.\"  They look up as Ray and Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back. \nINT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME \nBlack walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room. \nSuzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach, her thin, white arms crossed behind her head. \nSUZIE Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What if somebody was trying to strangle me? Or fuck me in the ass, even? (beat) I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes. \nRay manages a thin smile. \nRAY Meet my partner, Gloria Perez. \nSUZIE I did.  At Blue Balls. \nGLORIA Seems to me you left early, before we could meet.  But hi, Suzie. \nGloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of her own. \nAs the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach, turning her head as if to read the title. \nGloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) Don't touch me. \nGloria's hands fall to her sides. \nSuzie heads for the door. \nThe detectives exchange looks. \nAt which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) He did say something. \nGLORIA What was that? \nSUZIE He said, \"No little bitch can ever make me come.\" \nTHE SLIDING BAR DOOR \nof a jail SLAMS shut on Sam Lombardo.  He turns to... \nTWO menacing PRISONERS. \nPRISONER So you're the new chicken licker. \nCUT TO: \nCOURT TV IMAGE \nThe graphic -- \"Prime Time Justice\" -- then the anchor -- CYNTHIA. \nCYNTHIA (TV) Today from Superior Court in Miami, Florida -- Dade County versus Samuel J. Lonbardo. \nPULL BACK to REVEAL... \nINT. ART'S OFFICE, BLUE BAY HIGH - DAY \nArt, students, faculty members huddle around the TV. \nCYNTHIA (TV, CONT'D) The Lonbardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town of Blue Bay... \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nVideo crews surround a limo as Sandra and Kelly EMERGE. \nCYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D) ... with its tabloid appeal -- Sandra Van Ryan -- jet-set real estate heiress... \nTom Baxter and Barbara jostle up the steps. \nCYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D) The powerful Blue Bay elite... \nSuzie, in the company of Ruby and Walter, pushes past the video crews. \nCYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D) ... the girl from the wrong side of the tracks... \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nBryce Hunter confers with his team. \nKen in his neck brace, ENTERS with Sam and a bailiff.  Sam wears a suit.  Re's clean-shaven, recovered from the car wreck and beating.  Still, there is a weariness about him we have not seen before.  He makes eye contact with Sandra -- a cold stare. \nCYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D) In the end, the prosecution's case will come down to... \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHunter in front of the jury. \nHUNTER ... what happened to Kelly Lanier Van Ryan and Susan Marie Toller that will forever change the lives of these two young women?  What happened in those fifteen minutes alone with Samuel Lombardo? \nCLOSE ON SAM \nThe dark, seductive eyes. \nINT. COURTHOUSE - WITNESS WAITING ROOM - DAY \nSuzie, nervous, paces the floor, stops, lights a cigarette. \nThe other witnesses sit in chairs along the wail -- the lawn mower man, cul-de-sac kids, Barbara, Nicole, as... \nIN THE COURTROOM \nKelly Van Ryan sits in the witness box, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief while Bryce Hunter stands before her.  The room is silent, the spectators riveted on the scene. \nHUNTER Do you need more time? \nKelly shakes her head, no. \nHUNTER (CONT'D) I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have just one more question and even though its something we've been over, I want us all to be very clear about it. (a long beat) When you made the decision to stay at Mr. Lombardo's house, after he had offered you a ride.  When you saw that he intended to have sex with you, what were your exact words?  What did you say? \nKELLY I told him, no.  I said stop, Mr. Lombardo, please... I screamed for him to stop... \nSam looks up, confused. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed. \nHUNTER Your Honor... Please... \nJUDGE Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and the Court will hold you in contempt. (to Suzie) What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for conceiving this entire charade... \nSUZIE Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too. She's in love with him.  I mean her whole fantasy is him since her old man died.  Then she found out that Mr. Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that was it... \nGasps in the court as -- \nKelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff. \nKELLY You stupid little bitch... \nShe grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides. \nINT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER \nA mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door. \nSam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk on either side of Suzie. \nKelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of Kelly, pulling her toward the door. \nRuby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long, tattooed arms. \nGloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet moment.  The two men lock eyes. \nSAM I've found that adolescents make the best liars.  They're old enough to be good at it, but you want like hell to believe them, because they're still children. \nRay just looks at him -- a hard stare. \nEXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY \ntop down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue Atlantic on the other. \nWind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look. \nKEN (hyped) Come on, let loose! \nSAM I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare. \nKEN You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. \nSAM Just like that? \nKEN Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro. \nKen pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand. \nKEN (CONT'D) I told you they were going overboard and they did... They'll settle.  Believe me. They'll be begging to settle... \nAt which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens. He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as... \nThe T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo. \nSAM You don't think you're overdoing it? \nHe pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face, then tosses it out the window. \nINT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME \nTom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake. \nA console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos. \nSandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat. \nSANDRA I hope you're going to nail his scrotum to the nearest wall. \nBAXTER That might have been a possibility, if little miss not-so-bright here hadn't started throwing things. \nKELLY Fuck off. \nSandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair. \nBAXTER See what I mean... \nSANDRA You're going to let them get away with this... this shit?  On the word of one little white trash bitch... \nBAXTER You like seeing your name in the papers? \nSandra glares at him. \nBAXTER (CONT'D) Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in St. Barts.  Let things cool down. \nSandra concentrates on the TV. \nBAXTER (CONT'D) They'll try for twenty million.  The cheaper the lawyer, the higher the demand. \nKirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam. \nKELLY (CONT'D) I hate you! \nShe starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd gathers. \nSam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help him pick up the pieces. \nSAM You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I wanted to. \nEXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT \nSam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar. \nINT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME \nBaxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers. At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment. \nSandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room. Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam. \nFRANKIE I'll be seeing you. \nSam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his briefcase. \nKEN So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl. \nBaxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile. \nBAXTER I don't think you're gonna be eating at the Beef Bowl anymore, kid. \nHe EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk, drops into his chair, holds up the documents. \nSam watches, smiling, finally. \nSAM Thanks Ken, you did okay. \nBoth men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm. \nKEN (no clowning now) Look, I know there's a part of you wishes none of this had happened.  But it did.  Now take the money and get out of here.  Find a happy place. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT \nMoonlit fog -- the vast swamp. \nEXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT \nIt's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as... \nSam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow. Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear. \nINT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nThe neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old Venetian blinds. \nSam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back. \nHe reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening... \nBZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a flurry of BZZZZZZZZS \nSam frowns, sees... \nA cloud of mosquitoes circling him. \nHe checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed. The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open. \nSam stops fast. \nThinks.  Lets out a breath. \nSAM Damn maid. \nHe steps to the window.  He looks down -- \nMuddy footprints. \nSam freezes.  He whirls around -- \nA sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS. \nSam jumps back. \nSAM Ahhhh! \nThe neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS. Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way. \nSam backs up, hits the wall. \nKelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at her side, wrapped in a towel. \nRay nods. \nGLORIA (CONT'D) Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna make us look stupid. \nRay gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs. \nRAY Hey, don't back away from it, you were right.  We did look stupid. (beat) What you were wrong about, is who made us look that way. \nGloria just looks at him, puzzled. \nRAY (CONT'D) Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? (Gloria nods) So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place. \nGLORIA Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial. \nRAY I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless... \nGLORIA Unless what? \nRAY Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday. \nIt is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's COMPUTER. \nRAY (CONT'D) They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. \nGLORIA Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. (beat) He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... \nRAY (interrupting) The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. \nGloria gives this a moment's thought. \nRAY (CONT'D) Your old man graduates from Blue Bay School, you're not supposed to wind up there.  Board of Directors maybe, but not in the lousy guidance office.  Now. Point number two. (he taps at the printout on his desk) I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like Barbara Baxter. \nHe passes the printout to Gloria.  She looks at it, thinking. \nGLORIA So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father... \nRAY (interrupting) Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck. \nGloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat. \nGLORIA This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? \nRAY I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? (beat) He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. (beat) It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it. \nGLORIA Eliminate the competition. \nRAY You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp. \nGloria looks at him a long moment. \nGLORIA Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? \nRAY (a long beat; then beneath a smile) I net a guy in a bar. \nEXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY \nSam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away. \nAcross the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch. \nEXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY \nSam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone. \nRay Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The door swings shut behind him. \nINT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY \nGirls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin to walk toward the lockers, they encounter... \nRay Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on... \nKelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision. \nRAY (O.S.) Nice stroke. \nKelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her. \nKELLY Is there some reason why you're here? \nRAY Curiosity, I guess. \nKELLY About what?  How to improve your breast stroke? \nRay gives her a cold smile. \nRAY Actually, I was curious about how you see things working out, for you, Sam and Suzie. \nThis appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation. \nKELLY Excuse me? \nHe takes a sheet of paper from his coat. \nRAY (CONT'D) Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this over.  Know what it is? (as Suzie takes it) Sam deposited his check, transferred the funds to an offshore bank, a numbered account.  Not even the cops can find out whose names are on it.  Think one of them's yours? \nSuzie looks over the paper. \nRAY (CONT'D) He also put a down on some island property, and a lease-to-buy on a forty-foot sailboat.  You're into sailing, aren't you, Suzie? \nSuzie thrusts the paper back at Ray. \nSUZIE Get away from me. \nRAY Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet? \nSUZIE Shut up. \nRay smiles at her.  He moves up close. \nRAY You know, I don't think I ever told you I was sorry about your little friend... What was his name? \nSuzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray reaches out, takes her hand in both of his. \nRAY (CONT'D) Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You know his name. \nSuzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks her voice is scarcely above a whisper. \nSUZIE Davy. \nRAY (nodding, a scary smile) That's right.  That was his name. \nThe smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers. \nRAY (CONT'D) Sometimes I wonder if you're really as dumb as you pretend to be. \nHe looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the burn mark on her palm. \nRAY (CONT'D) But you know what?  I'd be keeping a clear mind right now if I were you. (beat) I'd hate to see you come to a bad end. Like Davy did. \nHe holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in the night. \nINT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSuzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number. \nSAM (V.0.) (answering machine) This is Sam.  I'm not in right now... \nEXT./INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT \nparked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp. \nThe skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel. He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see... \nHEADLIGHTS \nSuzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the highway. \nRAY'S TRUCK - RAY \nwatching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug. \nSXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT \nSuzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes. \nRay's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt, keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his little skiff out of the back once more. \nHe walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in. \nEXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT \nSuzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white. \nKelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast -- pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They argue -- we CANNOT HEAR. \nEXT. THE BAY - SAME \nRay has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine, maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind the cabanas, readies his camera. \nEXT. POOL AREA - SAME \nKelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi. \nKELLY I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you? \nSUZIE I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust. \nKELLY You can trust me. \nA cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.  Kelly and Suzie are startled by it.  Kelly answers. \nINT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nKELLY Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like you want it or something. \nSuzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand. \nKELLY (CONT'D) God, you are scared, aren't you? \nSuzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast. \nKELLY (CONT'D) And this is going to make you feel better, make you trust me... \nSuzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges... \nSuzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off Suzie's bottoms... \nON RAY \nstill at it with the video, his face impassive, watching. \nAs Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them... \nCUT TO: \nVIDEOTAPE \nKelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi. \nPULL BACK to REVEAL -- \nINT. POLICE ROOM - DAY \nGloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.  Hunter's seen enough.  He slams the stop/tape. \nHUNTER Are you crazy, Ray? \nRAY You heard Kelly say \"Sam.\"  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls... \nHUNTER Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. (beat) What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... \nRAY I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. (beat) They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money. \nGLORIA Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. \nRAY (turning now on Gloria) What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? (beat) Cone on.  She bought the same story we did... \nRay stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table a loud SLAP. \nHUNTER Listen, both of you.  You're not on a case.  There is no fucking case. (beat) I've had it up to here with Sandra Van Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like this and you are going to have her suing us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of these people's lives. (beat) Am I getting through on this? \nRay walks to the door, jerks it open -- \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nSam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer. \nHunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes. \nHUNTER Oh, Ray... no... \nRAY You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead... \nSam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response. \nHUNTER Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about this. \nSAM Give this idiot something to do.  Let him look into the Kennedy assassination. \nRay flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they can be separated once again. \nSAM (CCNT'D) (to Hunter) Next time this guy drags me down here, I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I didn't sue you the first time! \nSam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself. \nRAY Guess I kind of lost it there. \nGLORIA You could say that. \nRAY Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it? \nGloria studies Ray, clearly concerned. \nGLORIA We all have... \nRAY I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. (off Gloria's silence) I did that once.  I don't want to do it again. \nEXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON \nSam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where -- \nBarbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say. \nSAM You look pretty. \nMurky blackness. \nShe tries to focus, sits up. \nSUZIE Kelly? \nShe stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach. \nA shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) Kelly? \nThe shape gets closer and closer, until... \nSam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie. \nShe takes a step back. \nSam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach. \nSAM Suzie, it's okay.  It's me. \nSuzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly. \nSAM (CONT'D) I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. \nSUZIE Are you mad at me? \nSAM No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. (beat) We'll go through it all again tonight. \nSam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it. \nSAM (CONT'D) This is a celebration Suzie, not a suicide pact. \nHe lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle. \nSAM (CONT'D) We'll chill out first, have a drink, watch the stars. \nSuzie nods. \nSAM (CONT'D) Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the Jeep.  Could you get it for us? \nKelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as... \nSam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation. \nSAM (CONT'D) Let me tell you about this boat I picked out for us... \nThey move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the sand toward the cars. \nINSERT - A SCREAM \nA sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall silently on dark stone. \nKelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep, where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS -- it seems like forever \nSam APP\u00a3ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with Suzie's blood. \nKelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself against him -- a hard kiss. \nSAM I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it... \nKELLY (breathless) There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb... \nShe kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he can into the black waves. \nEXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER \nRear hatch open -- overhead light on. \nSam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches -- \nSUZIE'S FACE \nA mask of blood. \nKelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side door, gets in. \nSam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly. \nShe is focused on the dark Atlantic. \nSAM Are you okay? \nKelly turns to him -- an anxious face. \nKELLY (a long beat) My mom would kill me if she knew I took the Rover. \nEXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT \nKelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes. \nSANDRA I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight. \nKELLY Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip. \nSANDRA Where, the mall? \nKELLY A friend of mine bought a boat. \nSandra shakes her head, walks off. \nKelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of -- \nRay talking with Jimmy. \nEXT. THE BEACH - DAY \nRay and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder. \nJIMMY It's those rocks, up there. \nRAY You and Suzie used to come out here together? \nJIMMY Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here. (beat) You really think something bad happened to Suzie? \nRAY (ignoring the question) Lombardo ever come out here? \nJimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still, the idea generates a laugh. \nRAY (CONT'D) I say something funny? \nJIMMY No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would... \nRAY Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys... \nJIMMY Yeah, but... \nHe breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets. \nJimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees. \nCLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS \nas tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone. \nRay straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand. \nJimmy stares at the teeth. \nRay takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy. \nRAY I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy. You can catch a bus up there at the lot, okay? \nJimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts toward the lot. \nRay watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him. \nRAY People aren't always what they appear to be, kid.  Remember it. \nJimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying, clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OCEAN COVE - LATER \nTHE TEETH go into a plastic bag. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nBlack-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site. \nRay, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the rocks where he begins to take a blood sample. \nRAY Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here. \nHunter and Gloria exchange a look. \nGLORIA Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth. \nRAY Those are Suzie Toller's teeth. \nGLORIA Where's the body? \nRAY The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake. \nHe holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth. \nGLORIA Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. \nRAY You don't think Sam could've put it there? \nHUNTER Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if anybody murdered Suzie it was probably that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan. \nSAM Yeah, he got her busted for possession... \nKELLY I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit... \nSAM And you believe her? \nKELLY (a long beat -- a sigh) I don't know. (beat) I want to see you... \nSAM Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich. \nKELLY But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber... \nSam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees... \nACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus. \nSAM So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you. \nKELLY (beat) Okay.  I love you too. \nINT. TAURUS - SAME - GLORIA \nsees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad. \nShe's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.  She looks up, startled, to find... \nSam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel. \nSAM Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? \nGLORIA (a long beat) Suzie Toller is missing. \nSam lets out his breath, shakes his head. \nSAM How long? \nGLORIA She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. \nSAM Maybe she used another name. \nGLORIA Ray thinks she was murdered. \nSam shakes his head once more. \nSAM I don't know what to say... \nGLORIA You could tell me where you were last night. \nSam stares at her. \nSAM Goddannit... I don't have to... \nHe stops himself, calms down. \nSAM Come here.  I want you to see something. \nGloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and opens her door. \nINT. GLADES MOTEL - SAME \nSam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases. \nGLORIA Looks like goodbye. \nSam nods.  He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls out a file, hands it to Gloria.  As she takes it, he goes to the closet, takes a shirt from a hanger. \nSAM Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify. \nGLORIA Suzie? \nSam shrugs. \nSAM You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was killed.  I don't have to ask you who he thinks did it, do I? (beat) All I'm saying is, read that, you'll have a new perspective on things. \nGloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand.  She watches as Sam pulls on the shirt. \nGLORIA Why didn't you tell us about this before the trial? \nSam holds her eyes. \nSAM Then -- I still had ethical standards to protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now, I don't care.  And no amount of money can buy that back. \nSam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.  He looks outside. \nANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV \nA taxi waits in the glow of the green neon. \nSam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short enough to REVEAL shapely legs.  For a moment the two hold one another's eyes. \nSAM (CONT'D) My ride.  If you're not planning on arresting me, that is. \nShe seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.  Her eyes meet Sam's.  She breaks into a beautiful smile. \nVIDEOTAPE - RAY \nHUNTER (O.S.) She bit you? \nRAY Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom. \nEXT. BEACH RESORT - DAY \nSam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.  The girl wears a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered shirt.  They sip drinks.  Their eyes meet.  Their fingers touch. \nVIDEOTAPE - RAY \nRAY I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together. \nHUNTER (O.S.) You didn't cuff her? \nRAY She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... (shaking his head) I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin. (beat) There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking. (beat) I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest. \nINT. POLICE ROOM - SAME \nA moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.  A number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them, watch the tape. \nRAY I went there to protect her... \nHe hangs his head, then looks up, his eyes focusing. \nRAY (CONT'D) The teeth, were they... \nHUNTER (0.S.) Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass. \nEXT. BOAT HARBOR (CARIBBEAN ISLAND) - DAY \nBrilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a lagoon.  A quiet place. \nHeading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm. \nINT. HEARING ROOM - DAY \nGloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as -- \nRay stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter. \nRay wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged. \nCHIEF Detective Duquette; our investigation concludes that this was a good shooting. But that's irrelevant.  You were not assigned to this case -- whatever you imagined this case to be.  And now two young women are dead.  You are terminated with forfeiture of pension and benefits. \nRay looks at the floor. \nHunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video cassette inside -- labeled \"TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL.\" \nHUNTER Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were found near the area known as Stoner Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in conjunction with evidence obtained by Detectives Duquette and Perez has led this office to the conclusion that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan... \nSandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from the room by Tom Baxter. \nGloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BLUE BAY CEMETERY - KELLY'S FUNERAL - DAY \nGloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back from the open grave. \nAs Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze. \nANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV \nOn a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter. \nWhen Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he might make them disappear. \nGloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan family plot and, in fact, the entire scene. \nANGLE CN MARKER \nThe angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll and upon it the words: \n\"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE,\" and below that:  \"WILLIAM TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.  MAY HE REST IN PEACE.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A BEACH - NIGHT \nSam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone bungalow. \nThe bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach. \nEXT. PATIO - SAME \nAs Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short. \nRUBY (a long beat) He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades. \nRuby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face. \nRUBY (CONT'D) Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear. \nGLORIA She still work there? \nRUBY No.  Not after that night. (a long beat) I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. (beat) It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette. \nGLORIA Was there ever any kind of investigation... \nRuby cuts her off with a short laugh. \nRUBY Duquette always claimed the kid was dusted, came after him with a knife. But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This could be the moon for all most people care. (a long beat) Wasn't supposed to be like that though. This place was supposed to be something once.  There were going to be roads and houses.  There was going to be a town. They were going to call it Salt Creek. \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY \nFrom the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME. \nOn board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind. \nSAM Ray... you see that winch by your head? Take a couple of turns on it for me, she's luffing. \nRay cranes his neck to look at the winch. \nRAY You mean this thing? \nSAM Yes, we call it a winch. (pointing at pieces of the rigging) And these are shrouds, and these are stays. \nRAY I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat? \nSAM Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet. \nRAY Yeah, or get me drowned. \nRay kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch. \nSam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back to unhook the short line which holds the boom. \nThe mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc, directly at Ray. \nRay looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm. \nThe blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines, where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords. \nSam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board. \nThe boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a small ground swell. \nThe two men face each other. \nSAM Jesus, man... You okay? \nRAY That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean... \nSAM Come off it, man... It was an accident. \nRay nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and starts with it toward Sam. \nSam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum, preparing to throw. \nRay crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom sweeps the deck. \nSam throws the belt. \nRay grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself, a mean grin spreading across his face. \nThere's no tine for Sam to look for anything else. \nRay moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall, well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand. \nSam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's as far as he gets. \nWHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down, the handle skittering across the deck. \nRay follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten. \nRAY You... You're... \nHe scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed. But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks. \nRAY (CONT'D) You're dead... for godsake... \nThe boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as... \nSuzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a fresh spear at the ready. \nSUZIE Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. (to Sam) Nice move.  Good thing I was here to save your incompetent ass. \nSam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with some combination of pain, rage and fear. \n", "test1_input": "\"Wild Things\", production draft, revised by Kem Nunn \nWILD THINGS \nby \nStephen Peters \nrewrite by \nKem Nunn \nMANDALAY ENTERTAINMENT                           January 21, 1997 1202 West Washington Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 \nFADE IN: \nMAIN TITLE SEQUENCE -- BLACK \nINTERCUT -- QUICK FLASH-FORWARDS \nINSIDE A STEAMY SHOWER -- A wet naked woman and man wrapped around each other in ecstasy -- legs, arms, hair, mouths. \nBLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then \nMoonlight reflects on a vehicle's shiny surface.

BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY \nA place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky. \nBeyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of the school's sailing class bob at their moorings. \nFor a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER. \nThe CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder. \nINT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY \nA hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage. The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as... \nSAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish, drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids, in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes. \nHis entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls. \nKAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle. \nNICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side... \nKELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout. \nNICOLE When we graduate the only thing I'm going to miss is... (with a nod to the stage) Know what I mean? \nKelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Kelly? \nKELLY (still staring) Oh yeah. \nSam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles, silencing them with a wave of his hand. \nSAM We've come to the halfway point in my senior seminars... \nCheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle. \n", "test1_true": "JIMMY (O.S.) No! \nBoos as we FIND... \nJIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does... \nSUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare. \nSAM Thank you, Jimmy. \nJIMMY Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate. \nKIRK (O.S.) He means masturbate... \nThis remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND... \nKIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole. \nSAM Something Kirk with which I'm sure you have hands-on experience. \nLoud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X. The kids start to cheer. \nSam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S. \nThe cheering fades into silence. \nSAM (CONT'D) We've all heard the words, date rape, sexual harassment.  We've talked about some of these things in this room. (beat) Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria Perez. (beat) They're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have. \nSam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors... \nRAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses. \nGLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner. \nAbout five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium. \nRAY Thank you for having us.  We'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions... \nIN THE AUDIENCE \nSuzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath. \nSUZIE I'm not going to listen to this jack-off. \nShe marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door.. \nRay pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on... \nRAY Let's begin with a question.  What is a sex crime? \nA moment. \nJIMMY Not getting any. \nThis draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette. \nEXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nThe kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass. The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by. \nCAROLE Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo. \nSAM \nHey, Carole, you too.  And be good. \nCAROLE (beneath a pouty look) I hate to be good. \nThe three adults ENTER an old wooden building. \nINT. BUILDING - DAY \nSAM This is one of the original buildings. We have the offices here now. \nThe walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs. Gloria stops before one of the photos. \nANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH \nAn old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to another age. \nA handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has fixed upon is the future itself. \nGLORIA Anybody in particular? \nWhen no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria. \nSAM Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of 'Forty-Two (beat) My father. \nGloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and back again. \nVOICE (0.S.)

SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY \nNeat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in tropical heat. \nA BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole is driving.  Kelly sits beside her. \nNICOLE This is it? \nKelly looks at a pad of paper, nods. \nKELLY Four-thirty-seven. \nThey pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway, a guy mowing his yard. \nNICOLE Nice. \nKELLY What do you want, he's a teacher for Christ's sake.

SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME \nSam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg, kisses the back of her knee. \nHe pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her thighs. \nBARBARA (getting just a little breathless) Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my game... \nSam keeps at it.  She's starting to weaken. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Not that I'm going to be much good after last night... \nSAM Eat a power bar. \nBarbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when... \nThe DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nSam goes to the front door, opens it, to find... \nKelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat tummies, shorts and running shoes. \nGIRLS Hi, Mr. Lombardo. \nSam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile. \nKELLY Look, he forgot.  I knew it. \nSAM No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you. (beat) But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving. \nNICOLE You mean that isn't yours too? \nThe girls giggle.  Sam smiles. \nKELLY Where's the hose?  We can set up. \nSAM In back of the garage. \nAs they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.  She watches the girls with an appraising eye. \nBARBARA Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid? \nSAM Kelly. \nBARBARA She's going to wash your Jeep? \nSAM Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. (off Barbara's look) Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause. \nBarbara laughs at him. \nBARBARA Sam the philanthropist. (a beat) Tomorrow, right? \nSam nods.  Another kiss. \nEXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME \nAs Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind the garage.  She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching the girls.  When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then waves. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER \nKelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet T-shirt derby, ring the bell. \nSam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching the girls, then turning to walk back to his house. \nSAM So, where you off to now? \nKELLY Aren't  you forgetting something? (off Sam's look) Your coupon.  We gotta have it. \nSAM Jeez, that thing... Can't you... \n", "test2_true": "Nicole laughs. \nSAM All right.

You could give me a ride when you find the ticket. \nSam looks at her, as does Nicole. \nSAM Give me a minute. \nHe hurries from the room.  Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the eye, pointing toward the drive. \nNICOLE (mouthing the words) Are you sure? \nKelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face. \nINT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME \nSam is rummaging through drawers.  He stops when he hears the SOUND of a CAR.  He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's BMW headed down his street. \nINT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME \nSam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the linoleum. \nSam looks at the water.  He looks at Kelly.  She moves a step closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her. \nEXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD \nA long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac -- the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger passing by... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER \nThe front door.  The door opens.  Kelly comes out, fast, slamming the door behind her.  She walks down the drive. \nThere are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins to run. \nThe man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer. He watches as the girl runs by. \nThe teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac and DISAPPEARS around a corner. \nEXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY \nSam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat, rips through the Florida swamp land. \nHe glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat through a series of wide, sliding turns. \nSuddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT \nSAM Sly old fucker.  How you got so big, wasn't it? \nSam sits for a moment in the silence.  He pulls a pair of binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them. \nANGLE ON HORIZON \nAll we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings shimmering in the last long light of afternoon. \nSam watches for some time.  At last he lowers the binoculars, revs up his engine and leaves. \nANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT \nas it moves away, as SEEN from water level where... \nThe old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky waters of the swamp. \nEXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.  The Jeep is muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out. \nINT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME \nSam ENTERS.  The house is dark. \nSAM Barbara? \nNothing.  Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway, where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door. \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME \nSam opens the door.  He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.  He walks across the room and into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \nClouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water. Sam opens the shower door.  The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's gorgeous athletic body. \nBARBARA It's hot in here, just the way you like it. \nShe grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.

It is one we have seen before. \nANGLE ON PHOTO \nA stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick at his side.

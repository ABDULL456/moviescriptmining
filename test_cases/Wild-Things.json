{"test1_input": "Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene. \nSAM Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette. (to the cops) Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor. \nArt and the detectives shake hands. \nART So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life? \nSAM I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie. \nGloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back. \nRAY I've got that two o'clock in town. \nGLORIA (nodding) Back to the land of grownups. \nThe detectives shake hands once more with San and Art. \nSAM (to Gloria) If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. \nGLORIA (smiling) I'd like that. \nRay opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it. \nArt claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway. Sam remains near the doors, watching as... \nANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL \nRay and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus, which they get into and drive away. \nEXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER \nCheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks. \nANGLE ON DOCKS \nAs the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets about tying off the boat. \nSam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder. \nSAM (loud enough to be heard by his class) Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil those dock lines and I'll see you all on Monday. \nHe watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky. \nEXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER \nhosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as... A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake. \nJIMMY All right.  I could party on that. \nSam just laughs at him. \nSAM That's about all it's good for. (beat) That's the one to have. \nHe points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail. \nSAM The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that one summer. (beat) Long time ago. \nHe pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line. \nJIMMY You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... \nSAM Hey, you're working for it. (beneath a laugh) Least you're supposed to be. \nHe tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam. \nVOICE (O.S.) Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys? \nSam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam with a coy smile. \nKELLY So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo? (off Sam's blank look) The senior car wash, remember? (beat) Tamara's making a schedule.  She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list. \nSam smiles, remembering. \nSAM Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think? \nSam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then. \nKELLY Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I do it?  We're working as a team. \nSam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes. \nSAM Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off. \nKELLY Deal. (beat) You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? \nSam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school. \nKELLY (CONT'D) You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen. \nSam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain. \n", "test1_true": "JIMMY (still looking at Kelly) What? \nSAM A ride.  You want one? \nJIMMY Yeah.  But I got my bike. \nEXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY \nSam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy. \nAs they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign. \nA John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as... \nSuzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage. \nSam pulls up next to the bug and stops. \nSAM We got room for one more, Suzie.  You need a ride? \nKelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them. \nKELLY Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes? Whores-4-Less? \nSuzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud. \nKELLY (CONT'D) That's cute. \nSuzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear. \nKELLY (CONT'D) (to Suzie) I hope you swallow it. \nJimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away. \nEXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nMagnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid lush, tropical settings. \nSam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words \"VAN RYAN\" woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches in a code.  The gates swing open. \nKELLY Don't forget the car wash. \nSAM I won't. \nSANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42 in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive. \nKelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her mother coming toward her, her face hardens. \nSANDRA Is that Sam Lombardo? \nKELLY (sarcastic) Hi, Mon. \nSANDRA Sam!  Hi! \nSam has already hung a U. \nSandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep. \nJimmy is checking her out.  All eyes. \nSANDRA (CONT'D) (to Sam; as if Jimmy wasn't even there) What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi? \nSAM Hi, Sandy. \nSANDRA Why don't you come in, have a drink? \nSAM Can't.  Got a passenger. \nSandra looks down her nose at Jimmy. \nSANDRA He can wait. \nSam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front of the house, watching. \nSAM I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run. \nSANDRA I'll bet. (then, softening) Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out... \nSAM (cutting her off) Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans. \nSANDRA What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat... \nSAM Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time. \nSandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house. \nCLOSE ON KELLY \nstill at the door, a cold smile on her face. \nFADE TO: \n", "test1_id": 933, "test2_input": "Sam looks up, confused. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed. \nHUNTER Your Honor... Please... \nJUDGE Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and the Court will hold you in contempt. (to Suzie) What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for conceiving this entire charade... \nSUZIE Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too. She's in love with him.  I mean her whole fantasy is him since her old man died.  Then she found out that Mr. Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that was it... \nGasps in the court as -- \nKelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff. \nKELLY You stupid little bitch... \nShe grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides. \nINT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER \nA mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door. \nSam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk on either side of Suzie. \nKelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of Kelly, pulling her toward the door. \nRuby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long, tattooed arms. \nGloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet moment.  The two men lock eyes. \nSAM I've found that adolescents make the best liars.  They're old enough to be good at it, but you want like hell to believe them, because they're still children. \nRay just looks at him -- a hard stare. \nEXT./INT. KEN'S T-BIRD - DAY \ntop down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue Atlantic on the other. \nWind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look. \nKEN (hyped) Come on, let loose! \nSAM I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare. \nKEN You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. \nSAM Just like that? \nKEN Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro. \nKen pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand. \nKEN (CONT'D) I told you they were going overboard and they did... They'll settle.  Believe me. They'll be begging to settle... \nAt which point Ken spots something up ahead.  His smile broadens. He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as... \nThe T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo. \nSAM You don't think you're overdoing it? \nHe pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face, then tosses it out the window. \nINT. LIMO - MOVING - SAME \nTom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake. \nA console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos. \nSandra is next to Baxter.  Kelly is on the opposite bench seat. \nSANDRA I hope you're going to nail his scrotum to the nearest wall. \nBAXTER That might have been a possibility, if little miss not-so-bright here hadn't started throwing things. \nKELLY Fuck off. \nSandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair. \nBAXTER See what I mean... \nSANDRA You're going to let them get away with this... this shit?  On the word of one little white trash bitch... \nBAXTER You like seeing your name in the papers? \nSandra glares at him. \nBAXTER (CONT'D) Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in St. Barts.  Let things cool down. \nSandra concentrates on the TV. \nBAXTER (CONT'D) They'll try for twenty million.  The cheaper the lawyer, the higher the demand. \n", "test2_true": "HAXTER The man's life has been destroyed. There will always be doubters, no matter what happened in court. \nSANDRA I'm not paying any idiot twenty million dollars. \nBAXTER I said that's what they'd ask for. \nSandra stares from the window.  At last she turns to Kelly. \nSANDRA I hope you're happy. \nKelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling. \nKELLY Ecstatic. \nEXT. EVERGLADES - DAY \nSam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat. He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop. \nHe's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance. \nSam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler, takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something else from the cooler -- \n-- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water. \nANGLE ON WATER \nas the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LAW OFFICE - DAY \nKen's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter. Ken rises from a desk to greet him. \nKEN Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again. \nBAXTER Let's cut the crap.  What does your client want? \nKEN Besides an apology? \nBAXTER Unless you're planning on leaving Blue Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other days... You might want to keep that in mind. \nKEN Okay Tom.  My client wants your client to saddle up... so we can ride her ass all the way to the bank. \nEXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY \nA hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus. \nStudents line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see... \nSAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building. \nINT. ART'S OFFICE - ART \nworking at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his \"Educator of the Year\" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files. \nArt looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room. It is a slightly awkward moment. \nSAM Lizards don't seem to miss me. \nThe two men smile, breaking the tension. \nSAM (CONT'D) How you doing, Artie? \nART I... You know... I... \nSam waves him off. \nSAM Take care of my lizards, Art. \nArt stands up.  The two men shake hands. \nOUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE \nSam comes out, then stops suddenly. \nKelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long moment. \nSAM Kelly... \nKELLY Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... \nSAM Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning. \nArt APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer. \nKELLY Why don't you start fucking her again. You can spend it together. \nKirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam. \nHe ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the floor. \n", "test2_id": 934, "test3_input": "Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam. \nKELLY (CONT'D) I hate you! \nShe starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd gathers. \nSam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help him pick up the pieces. \nSAM You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I wanted to. \nEXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT \nSam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar. \nINT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME \nBaxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers. At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment. \nSandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room. Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam. \nFRANKIE I'll be seeing you. \nSam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his briefcase. \nKEN So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl. \nBaxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile. \nBAXTER I don't think you're gonna be eating at the Beef Bowl anymore, kid. \nHe EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk, drops into his chair, holds up the documents. \nSam watches, smiling, finally. \nSAM Thanks Ken, you did okay. \nBoth men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm. \nKEN (no clowning now) Look, I know there's a part of you wishes none of this had happened.  But it did.  Now take the money and get out of here.  Find a happy place. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT \nMoonlit fog -- the vast swamp. \nEXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT \nIt's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as... \nSam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow. Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear. \nINT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nThe neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old Venetian blinds. \nSam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back. \nHe reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening... \nBZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a flurry of BZZZZZZZZS \nSam frowns, sees... \nA cloud of mosquitoes circling him. \nHe checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed. The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open. \nSam stops fast. \nThinks.  Lets out a breath. \nSAM Damn maid. \nHe steps to the window.  He looks down -- \nMuddy footprints. \nSam freezes.  He whirls around -- \nA sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS. \nSam jumps back. \nSAM Ahhhh! \nThe neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS. Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way. \nSam backs up, hits the wall. \nKelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at her side, wrapped in a towel. \n", "test3_true": "KELLY So you got my mom's money. \nSam tries to breathe, manages a nod. \nKELLY (CONT'D) How much? \nKelly prods him with the concealed object. \nKELLY (CONT'D) How much? \nSAM About six and a half million dollars. \nKelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam. \nKELLY Your turn to pay. \nA moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL -- \n--  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun. \nKELLY (CONT'D) King Dong!  That's you, Sam! \nShe screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed. \nKELLY (CONT'D) It worked!  We screwed the bitch! \nShe's all over him now -- tongue kisses. \nKELLY CCONT'D) It worked just like you said it would. \nHe kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him. \nSAM God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here. \nKELLY Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom. \nShe kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it, tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts. \nA SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as... \nBANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side. \nA champagne cork hits the ceiling. \nSuzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle. \nSUZIE How much is about six and a half million divided by three? \nSAM Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change. \nKelly screams in joy again. \nSAM (CONT'D) Now calm down.  Both of you. \nThe girls put on mock serious expressions. \nSAM (CONT'D) From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood... \nKELLY Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party. \nKelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them clean. \nSAM Kelly, for christ's sake... \nShe has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch... \nSAM (CONT'D) The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves... \nKELLY (her hand in his crotch) Do it to ourselves? \nSAM (weakening) We have to stick with the plan. \nKELLY Stick? \nSam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to get him inside her. \nSuzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle, pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex... \nFADE TO: \nINT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nThe room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk lamp, by which halo we find... \nRay Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's printer finishes a job, as suddenly... \n... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks to his desk. \nRAY You saw the news today? \nGLORIA Lombardo's settlement? \n", "test3_id": 935}

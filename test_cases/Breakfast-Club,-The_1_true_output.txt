ANDREW Drop dead, I hope! CUT TO: 
9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga! CUT TO: 
10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Brian looks up.  Bender is messing with the door to the library. 
BRIAN Bender, that's, that's school property there...you know, it doesn't belong to us.  It's something not to be toyed with. 
The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat. 
ANDREW That's very funny, come on, fix it! 
BRIAN You should really fix that! 
BENDER Am I a genius? 
ANDREW No, you're an asshole! 
BENDER What a funny guy! 
ANDREW Fix the door Bender! 
BENDER Everyone just shhh! CUT TO: 
11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and listens to them through the closed door. 
BENDER (OS) I've been here before, I know what I'm doing! 
ANDREW (OS) No!  Fix the door, get up there and fix it! 
BENDER (OS) (screams) Shut up! CUT TO: 
12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall. 
VERNON (OS) God damnit! 
He opens the door and storms in. 
VERNON Why is that door closed? 
For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare at Vernon. 
VERNON Why is that door closed? 
BENDER How're we s'posed to know?  We're not s'posed to move, right? 
Vernon turns to Claire. 
VERNON Why?

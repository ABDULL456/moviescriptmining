STAGE AGENT (puzzled) Yeah? 
He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY 
The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of climbing up to the driver's seat. 
STAGE AGENT Here's your mail, Dave -- 
Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat. 
ROCKLIN (as he steps up to the seat) -- and a passenger. 
Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully -- 
ROCKLIN Mind if I ride up here? 
Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath. 
DAVE Where's them wimmen? 
STAGE AGENT Up at the hotel. 
DAVE (yanking mail sack from Agent) Why ain't they here? -- This is the stage depot, ain't it -- ? (heaves sack into boot) Ain't it? 
STAGE AGENT You can pick 'em up there -- it's only up the street -- 
DAVE On'y up the street -- an' they cain't walk it -- What's the matter -- don't Easterners have laigs like other folks? 
Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime stretches himself up toward Rocklin. 
STAGE AGENT (so Dave won't hear) Hold tight when you git in the mountains, mister -- When he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin' for miles. 
Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY 
From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops. 
DAVE (to handyman) Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin' for you to carry 'em out? 
Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow. 
SADDLER (as he comes to Dave) Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya? 
DAVE (getting to the ground) I ain't tellin' that crazy female nothin' -- Last time I seen her she threatened to rip the hide off'n me and bat me dizzy with it. 
Dave goes to the rear of the coach. 
SADDLER (looks up to Rocklin) Mister -- will you tell the Agent at Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet? 
ROCKLIN (nods) I'll say that. 
PORCH OF HOTEL 
Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the older woman. 
CLERK (as group comes through door) By next year, madam, we expect to have a bathtub on each floor. 
Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s. 
ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH 
having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin and the others come into the scene. 
MISS MARTIN Now don't drop it -- 
Dave pauses to see who is talking. 
MISS MARTIN At your age you'd best not be lifting things so heavy. 
DAVE (grimaces) Mebbe you're young enough to hoist her up your own self. (tries to lift trunk again) 
CLOSE SHOT 
on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin. 
CLOSE SHOT 
on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment. 
FULL SHOT 
Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it. 
Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring up at Rocklin. 
MISS MARTIN Clara! 
Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin. 
INT. COACH - DAY 
Miss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks coldly at Clara. 
MISS MARTIN (in low voice) Staring as though you'd never seen a man before. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY 
Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or less confidentially. 
CLERK Try to hold him down or he'll scare the women to death.

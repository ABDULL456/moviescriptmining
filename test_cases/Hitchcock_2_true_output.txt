ALMA Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder. 
He looks at her a moment. 
WHITFIELD COOK I've got a better idea. 
He steps closer. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara? We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy steaks we like at El Encanto. 
He playfully tugs at her sleeve. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) No shoptalk ... No silly magazine articles...just a wonderful meal... 
Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the WINDOW of the production office and notice the tell-tale BEND in the blinds. 
INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME 
Hitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just like he did with the other couple earlier. Except this little interaction is far from dull. 
A.D. HILTON GREEN We're ready for you on the set, Mr. Hitchcock. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll be right there. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
But Hitch doesn't move. 
A.D. HILTON GREEN Mr. Hitchcock? 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, FOYER - DAY 
ALMA enters the silent, empty house smiling to herself. She walks through to - 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
- and puts the grocery bags down on the counter. She listens. The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind -- 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Was there a line at the market? 
Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's cryptic ways. 
ALMA No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected. 
She puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Would you like a cocktail? 
He heads for the liquor cabinet. 
ALMA No. (he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either. 
Hitchcock stops. Pulls out a CELERY STICK from one of the bags and bites it. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Those haven't been washed yet. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CHEWING) I don't care. (THEN) I was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive. His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He takes another BITE, searching her face for some tell-tale sign of guilt. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be better in the scene. 
ALMA You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered. 
She gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as they rise and flex. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma finishes getting ready. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it. 
Alma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so- nonchalantly. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Lovely woman, Elizabeth... 
He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder victim. She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she knows she doesn't like it. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I was hoping you could come by the set tomorrow. 
ALMA I'll see how my day shapes up. 
She turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN.

{"train": "THE AVENGERS \nWritten by \nJoss Whedon \n\"And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble!\" \nBURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE \u00ad NIGHT \nKneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE OTHER, bows. \nTHE OTHER (V.O.) The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,... \nCUT TO: THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem encircled with silver blades. \nTHE OTHER (V.O.) But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow. \nHIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply \nQUAKES. \nTHE OTHER (V.O.) The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY \u00ad NIGHT \nOut in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies in. \nCHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers. \nEXT. HELICOPTER PAD \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nStanding a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is \nSHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON. \nWalking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY, FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson. \nNICK FURY How bad is it? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON That's the problem, sir. We don't know. \nINT. FACILITY FLOOR \u00ad NIGHT \nAgent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run around, taking only the essentials. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago. \nNICK FURY NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement. \nAGENT MARIA HILL It just turned itself on? \nNICK FURY What are the energy levels now? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac. \nNICK FURY How long to get everyone out? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Campus should be clear in the next half hour. \nNICK FURY Do better. \nCONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR \nAGENT MARIA HILL Sir, evacuation may be futile. \nNICK FURY We should tell them to go back to sleep? \nLOKI I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. \nNICK FURY Free from what? \nLOKI Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK. \nLOKI You will know peace. \nNICK FURY Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion. \nCLINT BARTON Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. \nNICK FURY Like The Pharaohs of Odin. \nSELVIG He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical. \nLOKI Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling. \nINT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL \u00ad NIGHT \nLoki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki. \nCLINT BARTON (pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles. \nAGENT MARIA HILL Who's that? \nCLINT BARTON He didn't tell me. Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave, as she's walking away... \nNICK FURY (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill. \nBACK AT THE LAB Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily. \nNICK FURY Barton is... \nINT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER \u00ad NIGHT \nSuddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps shooting. \nBACK AT THE LAB Fury is holding his side, running. \nNICK FURY He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. \nINT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL \u00ad NIGHT \nAgent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues. Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks. They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts herself at a distance. \nINT. FACILITY FLOOR \u00ad NIGHT \nFury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The entire facility is now in a full earthquake. \nINT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nAgent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps, dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them, but... \nAGENT PHIL COULSON No! Leave it! They run out of there like a bat from hell. \nINT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL \u00ad NIGHT \nAgent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and driving in reverse. Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on Barton. \nEXT. VAN \u00ad NIGHT \nAgent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie: \nAGENT PHIL COULSON You're clear, sir! You need to go! \nEXT. HELICOPTER PAD \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nFury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out. \nINT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL \u00ad NIGHT \nStill in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and put her back behind. \nINT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER \u00ad NIGHT \nNATASHA Look, you can't pull me out of this right now. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Natasha. Barton's been compromised. A beat. \nNATASHA Let me put you on hold. She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her, Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face. Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him. She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then \nKNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD. Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand. Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK \nAND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD. She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone and her heels, like a boss. \nNATASHA Where's Barton now? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON We don't know. \nNATASHA But he's alive. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. \nNATASHA Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy. \nNATASHA Bozhe moi. \nEXT. INDIAN SLUM \u00ad NIGHT \nA LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way through. \nINT. SHACK \u00ad NIGHT \nA tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him. BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor. \nATTENDING WOMAN What are doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here! \nLITTLE GIRL I have to see the doctor! It's my father! \nBANNER Calm down. What's wrong? \nLITTLE GIRL My father... Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few people, lying down, looking very sick. \nBANNER Is he like them? The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world. \nLITTLE GIRL Please. \nEXT. SLUMS \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nBanner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him. \nEXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK \u00ad NIGHT \nBanner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is left standing there like a dumbass. \nBANNER Should have got paid up front, Banner. Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns around, quietly. \nNATASHA You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. \nBANNER Avoiding stress isn't the secret. \nNATASHA Then, what is it? Yoga? \nBANNER You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded? \nNATASHA Just you and me. \nBANNER And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young? \nNATASHA I did. \nBANNER Who are you? \nNATASHA Natasha Romanoff. \nBANNER Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone. \nNATASHA No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD. \nPEPPER Oooooh. \nTONY My private elevator... \nPEPPER You mean OUR elevator? \nTONY ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne. \nPEPPER Not gonna be that subtle. \nTONY I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. \nPEPPER On the lease. \nTONY ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? \nJARVIS Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson. \nTONY You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON This is urgent. \nTONY Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears. \nTONY Security breach. \n(TO PEPPER) That's on you. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Mr. Stark. \nPEPPER Phil! Come in. \nTONY Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. \nPEPPER Come on in, we're celebrating. \nTONY Which is why he can't stay. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON We need you to look this over. (he holds out a file towards \nSTARK) Soon as possible. \nTONY I don't like being handed things. \nPEPPER That's alright, `cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark. \nPEPPER Thank you. \nTONY Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't a consultation. \nPEPPER Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about. \nTONY The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. \nPEPPER I didn't know that either. \nTONY Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. \nPEPPER That I did know. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't about personality profiles anymore. \nTONY Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases. \nTONY You know, I thought we were having a moment. \nPEPPER I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken. \nTONY How did you notice? Why is he Phil? \nPEPPER What is all of this? \nLOKI I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. \nTHE OTHER You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing. \nEXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP \u00ad DAY \nThe QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel. Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers. \nSTEVE Ma'am? \nNATASHA Hi. \n(TO COULSON) They need you on the bridge. Face time. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON See you there. Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking towards the railing of the ship. \nNATASHA There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? \nSTEVE Trading cards? \nNATASHA They're vintage, he's very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway. \nSTEVE Dr. Banner. Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands. \nBANNER Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. \nSTEVE Word is you can find the cube. \nBANNER Is that the only word on me? \nSTEVE Only word I care about. \nBANNER (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. \nSTEVE Well, this is actually kind of familiar. \nNATASHA Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly \"sail.\" \nSTEVE Is this is a submarine? \nBANNER Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE \nLIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles. \nBANNER \nOH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nThe doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP \u00ad a flurry of activity \u00ad dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS. Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY, who is at the command chair. \nAGENT MARIA HILL We're at lock, sir. \nNICK FURY Good. Let's vanish. \nEXT. SKY \nThe HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nSteve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge, taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE. \nNICK FURY Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it. \nNICK FURY Doctor, thank you for coming. \nBANNER Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying? \nNICK FURY Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. \nBANNER Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen. \nINT. STUTTGART GALA \u00ad NIGHT \nLoki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain. \nEXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM \u00ad NIGHT \nSuddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen. The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. \nEXT. STUTTGART GALA \u00ad NIGHT \nAs the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over. \nLOKI Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd. \nLOKI I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling. \nLOKI Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic. \nELDER GERMAN MAN Not to men like you. \nLOKI There are no men like me. \nELDER GERMAN MAN There are always men like you. \nLOKI Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. \nLOKI \n(STANDING UP) The soldier. A man out of time. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA I'm not the one who's out of time. From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki. \nNATASHA Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT. Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet. \nLOKI Kneel. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Not today! Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and FLIPS him over. \nINT. QUINJET \u00ad NIGHT \nNATASHA The guy's all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC's \"Shoot to Thrill\" overdrives the QUINJET'S speakers. \nIRON MAN Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has. \nIRON MAN Make your move, Reindeer Games. Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes away. \nIRON MAN Good move. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Mr. Stark. \nIRON MAN Captain. \nINT. QUINJET \u00ad NIGHT \nNatasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury speaks over her headset. \nNICK FURY (V.O.) Said anything? \nNATASHA Not a word. \nNICK FURY (V.O.) Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering. \nSTEVE I don't like it. \nTONY What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? \nSTEVE I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop. \nTONY Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates? \nSTEVE What? \nTONY It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match. \nTHOR Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. \nLOKI I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mj\u00f6lnir flies back to his grasp. \nTHOR You listen well, brother. I... \nTHOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN \nMID-FLIGHT. \nLOKI I'm listening. \nEXT. FOREST \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nTHOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up. \nTHOR Do not touch me again! \nTONY Then don't take my stuff. \nTHOR You have no idea what you're dealing with. \nTONY Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes? \nTHOR This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice! \nTONY He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mj\u00f6lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree. \nINSIDE THE SUIT \nTONY Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mj\u00f6lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj\u00f6lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back. \nINSIDE THE SUIT \nJARVIS Power at 400% capacity. \nTONY How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up. \nEXT. SKY \u00ad NIGHT \nThe two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him. \nEXT. FOREST \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nTHOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mj\u00f6lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here. \nTHOR I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes! \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Then prove it! Put the hammer down. \nIRON MAN Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer! \nTHOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJ\u00d6LNIR. Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY, raises the hammer. \nTHOR \n(TO CAP) You want me to put the hammer down? \nTHOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER. CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE \nSHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE. IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks at both men. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Are we done here? \nTHOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE. \nINT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY \u00ad NIGHT \nDOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs, smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head. \nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \u00ad NIGHT \nLoki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell. \nCOULSON) I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD. \nTONY (CONT'D) \n(TO THOR) No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants. \n(TO CREW) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks \nAROUND) How does Fury do this? \nAGENT MARIA HILL He turns. Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing. \nTONY Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. \nAGENT MARIA HILL When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics? \nTONY Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? \nSTEVE Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? \nBANNER He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. \nTONY Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. \nBANNER Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet. \nTONY Finally, someone who speaks English. \nSTEVE Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows. \nTONY It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. \nBANNER \n(LOOKS DOWN) Thanks. \nNICK FURY \n(WALKING IN) Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him. \nSTEVE Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. \nNICK FURY I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. \nTHOR Monkeys? I do not understand. \nSTEVE I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself. \nTONY Shall we play, doctor? \nBANNER Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing. \nINT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER) \nBanner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation. Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations. \nBANNER The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. \nTONY If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops. \nBANNER All I packed was a tooth brush. \nTONY \n(SMILES) You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land. \nBANNER Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem. \nTONY Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony. \nBANNER \nOW! Tony looks at Banner closely. \nTONY Nothing? \nBANNER And I'll read all about it. \nTONY Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. \nBANNER Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. \nTONY You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. \nBANNER But you can control it. \nTONY Because I learned how. \nBANNER It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face. \nTONY Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you. \nBANNER So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? \n(MORE) \nBANNER (CONT'D) That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? \nTONY \n(A BEAT) I guess we'll find out. Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers. \nBANNER You might not like that. \nTONY You just might. \nINT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C \u00ad NIGHT \nSteve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse, filled with METAL CRATES stacked. Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward. \nINT. VAN \u00ad NIGHT \nInside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM \u00ad NIGHT \nOn a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe. \nTHOR Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. \nTHOR They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Like what? \nTHOR BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Don't think so. \nTHOR They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come. \nTHOR When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. \nNICK FURY (O.S.) War hasn't started yet. \n(WALKING IN) You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is? \nTHOR I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him. \nNICK FURY A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. \nTHOR What are you asking me to do? \nNICK FURY I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? \nTHOR Loki is a prisoner. \nNICK FURY Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer. \nNATASHA \n(ON EARPIECE) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. \n(TO LOKI) Thank you for your cooperation. Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen. \nINT. BANNER'S LAB \u00ad MORNING \nFury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on the scepter. \nNICK FURY \n(ANGRY) What are you doing, Mr. Stark? \nTONY Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. \nNICK FURY You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. \nBANNER We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. \nTONY And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed. \nSTEVE PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. \n(TO TONY) Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow. \nNICK FURY (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... \nTONY I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of \nTHE WEAPONS. \nTONY What were you lying? \nSTEVE I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit. At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED. \nBANNER Did you know about this? \nNATASHA You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? \nBANNER I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. \nNATASHA Loki's manipulating you. \nBANNER And you've been doing what exactly? \nNATASHA You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. \nBANNER Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. \nNICK FURY Because of him. (pointing at Thor) \nTHOR \n(STUNNED) Me? \nNICK FURY Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. \nTHOR My people want nothing but peace with your planet. \nNICK FURY But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled. \nSTEVE Like you controlled the cube? \nTHOR You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war. \nSTEVE A higher form? \nNICK FURY You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. \nTONY Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down. \nNICK FURY Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? \nSTEVE TONY I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me? deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR everything? I thought humans were more evolved than this. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nIRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.) The relays are intact. What's our next move? \nTONY Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded! \nTONY Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Speak English! \nTONY See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. \nINT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT \u00ad DAY \nThor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand out. The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs right at him. At the last second, MJ\u00d6LNIR flies into his hand and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET. HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS \nTHE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR. Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws Mj\u00f6lnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but can't. Mj\u00f6lnir rests atop his hand. Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING. Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nFury and Agent Hill look over their monitors. \nNICK FURY We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. \nAGENT MARIA HILL \nGRENADE! The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready, waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn. A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill, who looks hot and sexy holding her gun. \nINT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION \u00ad DAY \nAgent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room. \nAGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.) We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every junction. \nINT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT \u00ad DAY \nHULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK grabs him by the neck. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nA gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical soldiers. \nAGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.) Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle levels 2, 3 and 4! \nAGENT MARIA HILL Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart! \nNICK FURY Get his attention. \nAGENT MARIA HILL (on her EARPIECE) Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN SHUTTLE! Don't get too close. \nESCORT 606 PILOT (V.O.) Copy. \nEXT. SKY \u00ad DAY \nESCORT 606'S jet BANKS to the right, heading towards the shuttle. \nEXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE \nESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going between Thor and the HULK. \nESCORT 606 PILOT Target acquired. Target engaged. (pulls the trigger; fires guns at HULK) A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS... \nESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT. \nESCORT 606 PILOT \nTARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY! HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but \nHOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR! \nCLINT BARTON Loki, he got away? \nNATASHA Yeah. I don't suppose you know where? \nCLINT BARTON I didn't need to know. I didn't ask. He's gonna make his play soon though. Today. \nNATASHA We gotta stop him. \nCLINT BARTON Yeah? Who's we? \nNATASHA I don't know. Whoever's left. \nCLINT BARTON Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose. \nNATASHA Now you sound like you. Natasha sits next to her partner and friend. \nCLINT BARTON But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? \nNATASHA He didn't, I just... \n(SHE PAUSES) \nCLINT BARTON Natasha. \nNATASHA I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out. \nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \u00ad DAY \nTony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a word. Steve walks in. \nSTEVE Was he married? \nTONY No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. \nSTEVE I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man. \nTONY He was an idiot. \nSTEVE Why? For believing? \nTONY For taking on Loki alone. \nSTEVE He was doing his job. \nTONY He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have... \nSTEVE Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony. \nTONY \n(WALKS AWAY) Right. How did that work for him? \nSTEVE Is this the first time you've lost a soldier? \nTONY (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife! \nSTEVE Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list... \nTONY (looking at the blood stained \nWALL) He made it personal. \nSTEVE That's not the point. \nTONY That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? \nSTEVE To tear us apart. \nTONY He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. \nSTEVE Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard. \nTONY Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... \n(PAUSE) Sonofabitch! \nTONY Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? \nLOKI Stalling me won't change anything. \nTONY No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one. \nLOKI The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? \nTONY \nTHE AVENGERS. (Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing. \nLOKI Yes, I've met them. \nTONY \n(SMILING) Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. \nTONY (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. \nLOKI That was the plan. \nTONY Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. \nLOKI I have an army. \nTONY We have a HULK. \nLOKI I thought the beast had wandered off. \nTONY You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. \nLOKI (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. \nLOKI It should work. \nTONY Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. \nTONY Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. \nLOKI You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry. \nIRON MAN And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass. \nEXT. STARK TOWER \u00ad DAY \nSelvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up \nANOTHER PORTAL. \nEXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE \nA hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on the end. \nINSIDE THE SUIT \nTONY Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nThe CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame. \nAN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF \nBUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF \nEXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE. \nEXT. STARK TOWER \u00ad DAY \nLoki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER. Loki turns to his ENEMY. \nTHOR Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! \nLOKI You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war! \nTHOR No. We can. Together. Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over. \nLOKI Sentiment. Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead. \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET \u00ad DAY \nThe TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A \nCHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES \nIT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION. TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the bridge. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Those people need assistance down there. CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap. \nBLACK WIDOW We got this. It's good. Go! \nCAPTAIN AMERICA \n(AT HAWKEYE) You think you can hold them off? \nHAWKEYE Captain. (pulls a trigger on his bow; a narrow is mechanically \nCHOSEN) It would be my genuine pleasure. HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge, followed by an EXPLOSION. Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH. HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it. People begin to run out. BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots. \nBLACK WIDOW Just like BUDAPEST all over again! \nHAWKEYE You and I remember Budapest verydifferently. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nThe COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT. \nYOUNG COP We need to get out! They gotta bring the National Guard! \nPOLICE SERGEANT National Guard? Does the army know what's happening here? \nYOUNG COP Do we? CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this ridiculous looking man. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. \nPOLICE SERGEANT Why the hell should I take orders from you? Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The Sergeant turns to his officer. \nPOLICE SERGEANT I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. \nEXT. SKY LINE \u00ad DAY \nIRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him. \nIRON MAN \n(TO JARVIS) We got his attention. What the hell is step two?! IRON MAN flies away. \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET \u00ad DAY \nHAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them. CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them, until... Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA What's the story upstairs? \nTHOR The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable. \nIRON MAN (V.O.) Thor is right. We gotta deal with these guys. \nBLACK WIDOW How do we do this? \nCAPTAIN AMERICA As a team. \nTHOR I have unfinished business with Loki. \nHAWKEYE Yeah, get in line. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us... Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he looks around the city. \nBANNER So, this all seems horrible. \nBLACK WIDOW I've seen worse. \nEXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING \u00ad DAY \nThor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJ\u00d6LNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on \nMJ\u00d6LNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL. \nTHOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE \nCHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK \nIN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP \nDEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI \nLEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nBack in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him. \nAGENT MARIA HILL Sir. The council is on. OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen. \nEXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING \u00ad DAY \nAtop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow, EXPLODING a RIDER. \nHAWKEYE Stark. You got a lot of strings sticking to your tail. \nIRON MAN Just try and keep them off the streets. \nHAWKEYE Well, they can't bank worth a damn. Find a tight corner. \nIRON MAN I will roger that. IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left. \nINSIDE THE SUIT \nTONY Nice call. What else you got? \nHAWKEYE (V.O.) Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down on 6th. \nTONY And he didn't invite me? \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM \u00ad DAY \nWe are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized by what lies beyond. WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them. \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM \u00ad DAY \nSuddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK \nCRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM, \nPOUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI \nLEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO \nWAVE OFF THE HULK. \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET \u00ad DAY \nBLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired. \nBLACK WIDOW Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Our biggest guns couldn't touch it. \nBLACK WIDOW Well, maybe it's not about guns. (gestures the flying \nCHARIOTS) \nCAPTAIN AMERICA You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride. \nBLACK WIDOW I got a ride. I could use a lift though. BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts and angles his SHIELD. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Are you sure about this? \nHAWKEYE Nat, what are you doing? \nBLACK WIDOW (V.O.) Uh... a little help! HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it at Loki, smiling. \nHAWKEYE I've got him. \nFIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S \nHEAD... \nSNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE \nAIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING... \nBBOOOOMMM!!!

I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND \nI WILL NOT BE BULLIED... \nHULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR \nREPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND, \nFLATTENING LOKI. \nHULK \nPUNY GOD. \nLOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN. \nEXT. STARK TOWER \u00ad DAY \nBLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down, weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the sky. \nBLACK WIDOW Doctor. \nSELVIG Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself. \nBLACK WIDOW It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing. \nSELVIG Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source. \nBLACK WIDOW Loki's scepter. \nSELVIG It might be able to close the portal. (Selvig looks down. He sees a \nGOLD GLEAM) And I'm looking right at it. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nTHOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS. IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing. \nJARVIS Sir, we will lose power before you cut through that shell. IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster. \nIRON MAN JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah? \nJARVIS I wouldn't consider him a role model. \nIRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth. IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The wind is knocked out of him.

SKY \u00ad DAY \nIRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed, suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die. The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nEvery single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate with Tony. NOTHING. \nEXT. SPACE \nWe then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about. IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening. The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES, causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nSuddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it through. \nEXT. STARK TOWER \u00ad DAY \nStill holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around, waiting. \nBLACK WIDOW Come on, Stark... \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nThor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to Cap. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA (to BLACK WIDOW) Close it. \nEXT. STARK TOWER \u00ad DAY \nWithout hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES. A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nCAPTAIN AMERICA \n(SMILING) Son of a gun! TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nTHOR He's not slowing down. Thor swings Mj\u00f6lnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK \nSNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A \nBUILDING. \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET \u00ad DAY \nHULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES \nTONY AWAKE. \n", "test1_input": "NICK FURY PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.

We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. \nWORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2 You believe? \nWORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1 War isn't won by sentiment, Director. \nNICK FURY No, it's won by soldiers. \nINT. BROOKLYN GYM \u00ad NIGHT \nSomewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS, a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory he's trying to fight off and repress. \nEXT. HYDRA BASE \u00ad DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCaptain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars, gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms. \nSTEVE (V.O.) There's not enough time!

And it seems... \nSHIELD SCIENTIST This guy is still alive! \nINT. BROOKLYN GYM \u00ad NIGHT \nSteve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of over repressed feeling. After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag up and starts punching again. Fury walks in. \nNICK FURY Trouble sleeping? \nSTEVE I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill. \nNICK FURY Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down. \nSTEVE I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost. \nNICK FURY We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. \nSTEVE You here with a mission, sir? \nNICK FURY I am. \nSTEVE Trying to get me back in the world? \n", "test1_true": "STEVE Hydra's secret weapon. \nNICK FURY Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs. \nSTEVE Who took it from you? \nNICK FURY He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. \nSTEVE At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me. \nNICK FURY Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym. \nNICK FURY Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? \nSTEVE You should have left it in the ocean. \nINT. OCEAN \u00ad NIGHT \nOut in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER. \nTONY You're good on this end. The rest is up to you. \nPEPPER POTTS (on the other line) You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid? \nINSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR. \nTONY Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. \nPEPPER Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works? \nTONY I assume. Light her up. As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP. \nPEPPER How does it look? \nTONY Like Christmas, but with more... me. \nPEPPER Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I can do some more tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards. \nTONY Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment. \nPEPPER Then get in here and I will. TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets. \nJARVIS Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. \nTONY I'm not in. I'm actually out. \nJARVIS Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting. \nTONY Close the line Jarvis. I got a date. \nINT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE \u00ad NIGHT \nPEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device. \nPEPPER Levels are holding steady... I think. \nTONY Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius? \nPEPPER Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I? \nTONY What do you mean? All this came from you. \nPEPPER No. All this came from that. Points to the energy in his chest plate. \nTONY Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit. \nPEPPER Twelve percent? \nTONY An argument can be made for fifteen. \nPEPPER Twelve percent? For my baby? \nTONY Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you. \n", "test2_input": "BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it. \nTONY Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer. \nBANNER Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all. \nTHOR Located the Tesseract? \nTONY I can get there faster. \nSTEVE Look, all of us... \nTHOR The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him. \nSTEVE You're not going alone! \nTONY You gonna stop me? \nSTEVE Put on the suit, let's find out. \nTONY I'm not afraid to hit an old man. \nSTEVE Put on the suit. At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract. \nBANNER Oh, my God! \nOUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE \nENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER! \nINT. BANNER'S LAB \u00ad MORNING \nEveryone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony. \nSTEVE Put on the suit! \nTONY Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE. \nNICK FURY Hill?! \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nPANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible. \nAGENT MARIA HILL Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is down! Can we get a run in? (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER) Talk to me. \nGALAGA PLAYER (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air. \nAGENT MARIA HILL We lose one more engine, we won't be. Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine. \nINT. BANNER'S LAB \u00ad MORNING \nNICK FURY Stark! You copy that?! \nTONY (V.O.) I'm on it! \nNICK FURY Coulson!

LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER \u00ad MORNING \nNatasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having landed hard.

HELICARRIER DECK \u00ad DAY \nBarton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel down into a corridor. \nBARTON Get that engine down! Detention! Get him through the dark! Come with me.

LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly. Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner... \nNATASHA Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me. Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there. \nNATASHA We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never... \nBANNER Your life? His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out. \nNATASHA \n(PLEADING) Bruce. Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the rubble. She stops. The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should. She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk. Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike anything. PRIMAL. Not human. \nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \u00ad DAY \nLoki looks up, smiling mischievously. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nFury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray. \nNICK FURY Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water. \nHELMSMAN Why water? Navigations recalibrated after the engine failure. \nNICK FURY Is the sun coming up?! \nHELMSMAN Yes, sir. \nNICK FURY Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nCAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do anything. Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN \nOFF. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Stark, I'm here! \nTONY Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine. \nINSIDE THE SUIT Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and its layouts. \nTONY I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nIRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve. \nIRON MAN I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position. IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this! \nIRON MAN What's it look like in there? \nCAPTAIN AMERICA It seems to run on some form of electricity. \nIRON MAN Well, you're not wrong. \nINT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER \u00ad DAY \nNatasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops. Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically. Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk and spins. ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of corridors. The sound the monster is coming. Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her. Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall, \nSMASHING INTO THE GROUND. The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room. \nINT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nBoth Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move. The HULK makes his move. SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and wraps around it. \nTHOR We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think! HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM \nFLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. SKY \nThor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass, but misses. Land draws closer. In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out into the meadow. \nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \u00ad DAY \nLoki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON You're gonna lose. \nLOKI \n(TURNING) Am I? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON It's in your nature. \nLOKI Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage? \nAGENT PHIL COULSON You lack conviction. \nLOKI I don't think I... \nAGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE, \nCAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON So that's what it does. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nBack in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nIRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS itself. \nINSIDE THE SUIT \nTONY Cap, I need the lever! \nSTEVE (V.O.) I need a minute here! \nTONY Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up. \nEXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nCAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the railing. BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself up and finally PULLS the lever. A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap. BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief. \nOUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance. \nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \u00ad DAY \nFury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Sorry, boss. They got rabbited. \nNICK FURY Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! \nAGENT PHIL COULSON No. I'm clocked out here. \nNICK FURY Not an option. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON It's okay, boss. This was never going to work... if they didn't have something... to... Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives. \nINT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad DAY \nNICK FURY (V.O.) Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up. \nSHIELD AGENT (V.O.) Paramedics are on their way. \nNICK FURY (V.O.) They're here. \nINT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE \u00ad DAY \nSteve and Tony listen in as well. \n", "test3_true": "INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad LATER \nFury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown on their devastated faces. \nNICK FURY These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD. \nNICK FURY We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. \n(A BEAT) Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore. \nNICK FURY Well, it's an old fashioned notion. \nEXT. MEADOW \u00ad DAY \nThor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJ\u00d6LNIR. \nINT. ABANDONED BUILDING \u00ad DAY \nBanner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there, amazed. \nSECURITY GUARD You fell out of the sky. \nBANNER \n(COMING TO) Did I hurt anybody? \nSECURITY GUARD There's nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though. \nBANNER Lucky. \nSECURITY GUARD Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell. \nBANNER You saw? \nSECURITY GUARD The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here... He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants. \nSECURITY GUARD I didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella. \nBANNER Thank you. A beat. \nSECURITY GUARD Are you an alien? \nBANNER What? \nSECURITY GUARD From outer space, an alien? \nBANNER No. \nSECURITY GUARD Well then, son, you've got a condition. \nINT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM \u00ad DAY \nBarton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton tries to shake off Loki's mind control. \nNATASHA Clint, you're gonna be alright. \nCLINT BARTON You know that? Is that what you know? I got...I gotta go in though. I gotta flush him out. \nNATASHA We don't have that long, it's gonna take time. \nCLINT BARTON I don't understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and send something else in? Do you know what it's like to be unmade? \nNATASHA You know that I do. \nCLINT BARTON Why am I back? How did you get him out? \nNATASHA Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head. \nCLINT BARTON Thanks. (Natasha unfastens the \nRESTRAINTS) Tasha, how many agents? \nNATASHA Don't.

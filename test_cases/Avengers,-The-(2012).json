Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking towards the railing of the ship. \nNATASHA There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? \nSTEVE Trading cards? \nNATASHA They're vintage, he's very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway. \nSTEVE Dr. Banner. Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands. \nBANNER Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. \nSTEVE Word is you can find the cube. \nBANNER Is that the only word on me? \nSTEVE Only word I care about. \nBANNER (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. \nSTEVE Well, this is actually kind of familiar. \nNATASHA Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.

They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE \nLIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN VTOL FLIGHT.

So, uh... how long am I staying? \nNICK FURY Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. \nBANNER Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen. \n", "test1_true": "NATASHA That's still not gonna find them in time. \nBANNER You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? \nNICK FURY How many are there? \nBANNER Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? \nNICK FURY Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall. \nNATASHA You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. \nINT.

He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM. \nCLINT BARTON Is this the stuff you need? \nSELVIG Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of. \nCLINT BARTON Especially if SHIELD knows you need it. \nSELVIG Well, I didn't know! (sees Loki coming) Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth. \nLOKI I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? \nCLINT BARTON My next target. \nLOKI Tell me what you need. \nCLINT BARTON I'll need a distraction.

HELICARRIER BRIDGE \u00ad NIGHT \nAs they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON I mean, if it's not too much trouble. \nSTEVE No, no. It's fine. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but... \nAGENT JASPER SITWELL We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy- nine percent. \nAGENT PHIL COULSON Location? \nAGENT JASPER SITWELL Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.

HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge, followed by an EXPLOSION. Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH. HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it. People begin to run out. BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots. \nBLACK WIDOW Just like BUDAPEST all over again! \nHAWKEYE You and I remember Budapest verydifferently. \nEXT. MANHATTAN \u00ad DAY \nThe COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT. \nYOUNG COP We need to get out! They gotta bring the National Guard! \nPOLICE SERGEANT National Guard? Does the army know what's happening here? \nYOUNG COP Do we? CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this ridiculous looking man. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. \nPOLICE SERGEANT Why the hell should I take orders from you?

Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA What's the story upstairs? \nTHOR The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable. \nIRON MAN (V.O.) Thor is right. We gotta deal with these guys. \nBLACK WIDOW How do we do this? \nCAPTAIN AMERICA As a team. \nTHOR I have unfinished business with Loki. \nHAWKEYE Yeah, get in line. \nCAPTAIN AMERICA Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us... Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE.

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob driving, they pull away. 
141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT) 
Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS. 
142  EXT.  THE TURTLE 
LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator. The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on the rear module of the Turtle. 
The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob hurries on to more important business. 
143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE 
As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling bracket. 
144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE 
Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and lurches the front module away from the burning rear module. She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears, watches the rear module BURNING. DISSOLVE TO: 
145  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT 
Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on the outskirts to avoid being seen.  They look at one another -- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago.  No one seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin. 
146  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN 
It's dark.  Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there.  He blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas lantern and heads back outside again. 
147  INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE 
Neff pries himself from his MTV to answer a KNOCK at the door.  Eric hobbles in.  Neff notes Eric's weatherbeaten condition. NEFF You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell. ERIC Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie? NEFF Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you. ERIC Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me -- NEFF -- Here?!  Where's Wilder? ERIC Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg. 
NEFF If Corbett's men find out -- ERIC -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow. NEFF Jiminy Christmas. (beat) What do you want from me? ERIC Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight. (CONTINUED) 147  CONTINUED: NEFF I'll go at dawn. ERIC Thanks.  Don't tell anyone you saw me. 
After Eric goes, Neff closes his door and bolts it. 
148  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT 
The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of last week seem ages ago. 
Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches; bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from the others. 
149  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA 
Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a roof leak with pitch.  Neff is sullen from his conversation with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff. NEFF Why the smirk? KENAI Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose. (off Neff's flustered look) I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you. NEFF You're out of your greedy goddamn mind. KENAI Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass. NEFF Stay out of it. 
150  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove.  Corbett watches from the cot in the cell. CORBETT Talk to that good-looking girl of yours? ERIC You broke the radio, remember? CORBETT (smiles) I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.

The weasel continues to gnaw. 
POOH-BEAR He don't believe you. Big Bill. 
BIG BILL Drop your package in the cage. 
DANNY My what? 
BIG BILL Put your pee-pee through the hole. 
There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the Plexiglas from Captain Steubing. DANNY This is fucking crazy! 
Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun. 
BIG BILL Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. 
DANNY Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ... 
Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, is watching the weasel. 
Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the side. 
Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order. 
POOH-BEAR Shoot him. 
DANNY Okay! Okay! 
From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the cage. 
DANNY (cont'd) (eyeing the wild rodent) Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ... 
Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is standing right next to him. 
POOH-BEAR Now get talkin' 
DANNY I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God! 
Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an inch. 
THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm through. 
POOH-BEAR You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now. 
The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas. 
Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between the coat and the lining. 
No one notices. 
Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth. 
DANNY (rapid-fire) Captain Steubing, listen to me. You're after the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to. 
He nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head. 
DANNY (cont'd) Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his own stuff on the side. 
LITTLE BILL That's a pack of discharge. 
Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently. 
DANNY It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night ... said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers. 
Pooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate. 
Danny keeps one eye on ... 
... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening. 
POOH-BEAR Man'll say a lot of thing when he's sporting weasel food for a pecker. 
LITTLE BILL Damn straight. 
POOH-BEAR Least I can do is check it out though. 
Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband. 
DANNY Can I pull my dick out now? 
Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Big Bill 
Big Bill pats Little Bill down. 
LITTLE BILL (holding up his arms) Go ahead. I got nothing to hide. 
Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty. 
The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole. 
DANNY Can I pull my dick out? 
Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat. 
BIG BILL He's clean. 
Danny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big roll of cash protrudes from the hole.

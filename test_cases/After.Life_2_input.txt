JACK I think it's dead. Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick. 
ANNA No.   The poor thing's just scared. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY 
School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files. He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty. 
PAUL OK.   Who took the last pepperoni? A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box. 
PAUL Great.  Broccoli. (lifts out a slice) Who the fuck ordered broccoli? NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up. 
NEAL Oh that's just disgusting. 
PREPPY GUY What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's healthy. 
NEAL Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy. Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time. He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door. 
NEAL You ordering in another pizza? 
PAUL Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts. Everyone laughs. 
PREPPY GUY 
(MUTTERS) Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door. Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Paul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard. 
PAUL Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this morning.    I fucked up. I know. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Anna steps into an empty corridor. 
PAUL (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) We still on for tonight? 
(BEAT) Anna? 
ANNA I don't know Paul. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Paul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something. 
PAUL Please Anna.    It took me weeks to get the table. 
ANNA (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) Maybe we can change it to Thursday-- 
PAUL No.     It has to be tonight.

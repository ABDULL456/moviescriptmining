WITCH You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well! 
GLINDA (laughs) Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too. 
WITCH Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way.... MCU -- Witch threatens Dorothy o.s. in f.g. --

DOROTHY Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came. 
GLINDA No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself! 
DOROTHY The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked? 
GLINDA Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?

GLINDA Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch. 
EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64 
The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed against it. 
MONK It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up. 
Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch. 
EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65 
Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced partway open by the warping of the hull. 
COFFEY (V.O.) Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact. 
LINDSEY How many are there? 
COFFEY (V.O.) 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile. 
LINDSEY That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they? 
SCHOENICK Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima. 
LINDSEY (V.O.) Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a can. 
COFFEY (V.O.) Let's knock off the chatter, please. 
INT. CAB THREE                                                          66 
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room. 
MONK (V.O.) Getting a reading? 
HIPPY It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. 
EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67 
Monk moves into the opening. 
MONK Alright.  Let's get in there. 
Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark corridor beyond. 
EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68 
Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down. 
Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away from the rest of the hull. 
COFFEY We'll go in through that large breach. 
BUD Let's go, guys. 
Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him. 
BUD Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on you, or any loose equipment that could fall. 
Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside. 
INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69 
They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends. Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors, Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded. 
INT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70 
Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery. 
INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71 
From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door. 
COFFEY It's jammed.  Give me a hand. 
Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE... RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping. 
Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way. 
COFFEY Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were going to see this. 
They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage. Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage. Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair, someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses. 
Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent. 
BUD How you guys doing? 
SONNY I'm alright, I'm dealing. 
CATFISH Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...

RIGGAN Of course. SYLVIA She's trying to stay away from everything and everyone that got her into rehab in the first place, but... 
RIGGAN ...I know, Sylvia... 
SYLVIA ...But that's all she had. So she's-- RIGGAN I really do get it. 
SYLVIA I know you're caught up in all this stuff, but-- 
RIGGAN Stuff... 
SYLVIA You know what I mean. (Beat.) Riggan... You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one. 
RIGGAN Yeah. Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in. 
LAURA (Noticing Sylvia.) Oh, sorry. 
She closes the door. Awkward silence. 
SYLVIA So how is that going? Is she and Sam--? 
RIGGAN I don't wanna talk about it. (CONTINUED) 
He goes to a small fridge, takes out a beer and closes it. 
SYLVIA You're drinking? 
RIGGAN I'm having a beer. 
SYLVIA Okay... He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to take out the wig. 
RIGGAN So, what's going on with you? 
SYLVIA Me? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess. I'm going back to teaching. RIGGAN I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu house. 
SYLVIA Wh-- I'm sorry? 
RIGGAN I'm thinking about-- 
SYLVIA No, I heard you. I just need a second to-- (A beat.) That's gonna be Sam's house. Why would you-- (A beat.) What? For this play? 
RIGGAN (Honest and vulnerable.) I need the money. 
SYLVIA Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds? 
RIGGAN What do you want me to say? My health lasted longer than the money... Go figure that out. 
Riggan seems pensive and lost. 
SYLVIA Riggan... (Beat.) What's going on?... Look at me. 
(CONTINUED) 
Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia. 
RIGGAN I have a chance to do something right. And I have to take it. I have to. 
SYLVIA It's funny. I was sitting here waiting for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't remember why we broke up. Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said. 
RIGGAN The last time I flew here from LA, George Clooney was sitting two seats in front of me. With those cuff links, and that... chin. We ended up flying through this really bad storm. The plane started to rattle and shake, and everyone on board was crying... and praying. And I just sat there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam opened that paper it was going to be Clooney's face on the front page. Not mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah Fawcett died on the same day as Michael Jackson? 
She smiles sadly. She kisses him on the head and goes to the door. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Why did we break up? 
SYLVIA (Looks him in the eye.) You threw a kitchen knife at me... 
Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor. 
SYLVIA (CONT'D) ...and one hour later you were telling me how much you loved me. (Beat.) Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn didn't mean I did not love you. But that's what you always do. You confuse love with admiration. 
She smiles sadly. He looks at her. As Sylvia opens the door, she turns back to Riggan... 
(CONTINUED) 
SYLVIA (CONT'D) It's your house, so do what you want with it. Just make sure you're there for our daughter.

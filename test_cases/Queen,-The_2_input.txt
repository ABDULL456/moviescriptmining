CHARLES looks up.. 
CHARLES (cont'd) Why do they hate us so much? 
The QUEEN mutters under her breath... 
ELIZABETH Not `us', dear. 
CHARLES (not having heard) What? 
The QUEEN salutes GAME-KEEPERS who remove their hats as the QUEEN roars past. 
CHARLES Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun. 
CHARLES's hands wring in anxiety.. 
CHARLES (cont'd) I thought someone had taken a shot at me. 
he QUEEN hits the brakes, and pulls up. Visibly irritated by her son's weakness. She opens the door, and steps out.. E ELIZABETH Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back.. 
CHARLES Are you sure? 
ELIZABETH Yes. It looks like rain.. (the DOGS jump out) And I'm not in the mood for stalking anyway. 
CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives off. 
The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust. 
The QUEEN straightens, then notices her shoe-laces are undone. The DOGS bark excitedly. 
ELIZABETH Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? a beat) You wouldn't get any proper walks then. 
The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much easier than people... 
ELIZABETH Right. Done. Now who knows the way home? 
he DOGS yap excitedly, immediately scamper off in the direction of the castle.. 
ELIZABETH You clever things! 
EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY 
HARLES's Land Rover drives up into the hills, into spectacular landscape. A mile or two ahead, above the tree- line, PHILIP, the two PRINCES and STALKERS carrying guns, crawl on their bellies in pursuit of their quarry.. 
A hundred years ahead of them, the STAG, unaware of the danger, imperiously, grazes on the grass.. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT 
The QUEEN, granite-faced, still smarting from her row with CHARLES, is in her bedroom. A nightcap martini is on her bedside table. She is writing her diary. 
PHILIP emerges from the bathroom, appears in the doorway.. 
ELIZABETH I spoke to Charles this afternoon. 
flicker of coldness behind her eyes.. 
ELIZABETH Who was good enough to share with me his views on motherhood. 
PRINCE PHILIP What did he say? A TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes, the infamous Martin Bashir `PANORAMA' interview.. 
ELIZABETH How wonderful Diana was. 
RINCE PHILIP That's changing his tune. 
ELIZABETH What a natural. 
IANA (ON TV) ..I think..they see me as a threat of some kind.. 
PRINCE PHILIP sees what's on television, then grimaces.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (puckers face) Oh, for God's sake..

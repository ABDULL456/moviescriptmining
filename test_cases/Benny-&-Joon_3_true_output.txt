Girl: Lets do it.Outside Benny and Joons house, then inside. 
(Benny is walking home from work, he hears shouting inside) 
Joon: Get out of my sight! 
Smeal: you wouldnt dare Joon. 
(Joon screams and throws plate across room.) 
Benny: what is going on here? (He rushes in) Joon! Mrs Smeal! Mrs Smeal, please. 
Smeal: Beware the winds of reason shall blow stern. 
Benny: What? 
Smeal: I am done Mr Pearl, I am done. The mules turned to glue, she left the house unescorted, she has sudden outbursts. She is simply unmanageable 
Benny: Mrs Smeal! Please, wait, please. Let me talk to her. I can talk to her, you cant quit on such short notice. 
Smeal: oh, well Im sorry sir. In Ireland we have a saying when a boat runs ashore, the sea has spoken. 
(Mrs Smeal leaves)In the kitchen, Benny is cooking and on the phone to Eric.Benny: Listen, if she is going to be alone every day until I find another housekeeper, Im not leaving her alone at night too. 
Eric: Listen bring her, whats she going to do? She paints and she reads. 
Benny: Yeah, she paints, she reads, she lights things on fire. 
Eric: that happened once. Look I got a fire extinguisher, just bring her. Now get your ass over here, and dont forget the Louie Prang record. Remember, always play for keeps. 
Benny: all right, all right, all right, Ill be there. 
Benny: Joon Dinner! Spaghetti and salad.

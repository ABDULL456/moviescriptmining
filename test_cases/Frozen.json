{"train": "A -I watched the game with you last week! \nLYNCH For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes. \nM They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know? \nDAN Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you... \nD LYNCH No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet. \nE DAN She's getting better. (then) Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem. \nLYNCH It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything. \nThey see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she glides her way back to the end of the line. \nShe looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then excitedly waves. Proud of herself. \nDan smiles at Lynch. \n6   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                             6 Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the line. \nX DAN Good work!     See?   They always go for it. \nR PARKER I did good, right? \nLYNCH You did great. \nA DAN Oh, so where's my change? \nPARKER There isn't any. \nM DAN You gave him the full hundred? \nPARKER He wasn't going for it at 50. \nDAN \nD So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? Like, I don't know, $51 or maybe even $75? \nPARKER \nE You gave me two 50's. What was I supposed to do, ask for change? \nLYNCH I would have asked for change. \nPARKER It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right? \nDan is disappointed. \nLYNCH I would have definitely asked him for change. \nThey get up to the front of the line.    Jason looks at Dan and Lynch behind Parker. \nJASON (scoffs at Parker) \"Girlfriends\"? \nX Parker gives him an apologetic smile. \nThe three get in front of the chair. It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air. \nR 7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7 The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top. \nA DAN Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby. \nM PARKER (teasing) Oh, now I'm \"baby\"?     You never call me pet names. \nDAN I'm just not a `pet name' guy. \nD PARKER (to Lynch) He calls me \"Parker.\" \nE DAN It's your name. \nPARKER Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like \"honey\" or \"sweetie\". \nLYNCH I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. \"Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!\" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. \nDan looks back to Parker. \nDAN See? At least I don't call you \"O'Neil\". \nPARKER You don't touch my face enough either. \nX Dan laughs. \nLYNCH (to no one imparticular) \nR Third wheel. \nDAN \nE Look at you! See?   Having fun? \nPARKER Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too. \nLynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder. \nLYNCH Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! \nHe eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass. \nParker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet. \n10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10 Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while \nX Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them. \nDAN We gotta take a weekend trip up \nR North one of these days. Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right. \nLYNCH \nA Why don't we just do it over Christmas. You and me. \nDAN Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like \nM the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see. \nLYNCH Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill \nD all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight? \nDan feels bad. \nE DAN Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few. \nParker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is pretty much right on top of them. \nLYNCH No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point. \nParker feels horrible. \nPARKER You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go- \nX Now Lynch feels horrible. \nLYNCH -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that. \nR Parker looks to Dan. \nPARKER I told you I didn't have to come. \nA LYNCH Parker, I didn't not want you to come. \nDan tries to help. \nM DAN It was his idea that we invited you in the first place. \nLYNCH Exactly. Remember? I was like \"Hey man, why doesn't Parker come \nD with us?\" And you were like- \nDAN -I was like, \"OK that would be cool\". \nE Parker isn't buying it.   She puts on a smile. \nPARKER It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on \"guy time\". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. (to Dan) Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages. \nDAN No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell. \nX Parker laughs. \nPARKER She does not. \nR Dan looks to Lynch. \nDAN Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom \nA kept calling and calling. (to Parker) And what did she want? \nParker laughs. \nM DAN (cont'd) She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer. \nD LYNCH What did you say?   You said chicken. \nM He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the mountain. \nDAN But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs! \nD JASON It's not my decision, man.    They're closing early. \nDAN \nE You're only open three days a week. You can't afford to close early. \nJASON Why don't you write a letter? \nLynch pushes himself up behind them. \nLYNCH (to Dan) Remember \"429\". \nDAN What? \nLYNCH Just remember \"429\". (to himself) \nPARKER (to Jason) \nX Come on, just one more run. \nJASON Sorry. \nR DAN Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have. \nA LYNCH (to Jason) Hey man, do you have a pen? \nJason ignores him. \nM JASON It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do. \nPARKER What if we promise to run straight \nD down. Like the quickest run ever. \nDAN Wicked fast. \nE Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around.        There are still plenty of skiers coming down. \nJASON Fine. But hurry. DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much! \nDAN We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind! \nJason sends them up the lift.    He checks to make sure no one is watching. \n13   EXT. CHAIR LIFT    - MOMENTS LATER                        13 Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again. \nLYNCH Seriously. For a hundred bucks \nX you'd think he could cut us some slack. \nDAN I know right? They're supposed to \nR stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened to night skiing? \nLYNCH Wachusett still has night skiing. \nA We should have gone there. It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame. (then) Hey, you remember the numbers I told you? \nM DAN \nPARKER Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number! \nD DAN What did He-Man have to say about that? \nLYNCH \nE That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick. (then) Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? \"5022\". Parker, will you remember \"5022\"? \nPARKER Nope. \n14   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                         14 Jason reaches for his cigarettes.    He's all out. \nDisappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash. \nA fellow employee (RIFKIN) approaches. \nRIFKIN Early night, huh? \nJASON You're not gonna hear me complain. \nX RIFKIN Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule. \nR JASON I'm not working next weekend. \nE DAN It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax. \nThe chair moves on in silence for a few moments. \nPARKER Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding. \n18   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                      18 Rifkin kicks his feet around. He spies Jason's discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes. \nX Nothing. \nHe sighs. \nJust then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few \nR minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him. \nA voice from the top lift cuts through the radio. \nVOICE (O.S.) \nA Last chair is through. \nRifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain. \nRIFKIN Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm \nM clear. \nVOICE (O.C.) Clear up here. \nHe hangs up and moves over to the lever. \nTight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him. \nD 19   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                              19 The chair lurches to a stop. Once again, the comforting \nE white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence. \nThe wind blows hard against them. \nDAN Oh, come on. \nParker instinctively grabs his hand. \nThe cold bites through their layers of clothing. \nPARKER Bur! \nLYNCH (yelling to the sky) IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU! \nThey sit and wait in silence for a few seconds. \nX PARKER It's gonna start again, right? \nDAN (quickly) \nR Yes. (then) Anyone got any jokes? \nLYNCH \nA What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity? \nDAN \"Get off me, you're crushing my \nM Marlboros\". \nBeat. \nLYNCH I told you that? \nCUT TO: \nD 20   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                         20 From this distance the mountain looks like a giant night- \nE light of converging white strings. \nEven in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees. \nCUT TO: \n21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 21 The three sit in the freezing chair.   Lynch is really getting impatient. \nDAN What do you think the worst way to die would be? \nPARKER That's not morbid. \nLYNCH Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan. \nLYNCH I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie. \nX DAN HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!???? \nParker is starting to shake. \nR PARKER (quietly) No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here. \nA DAN No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now. \nM He starts waving around his hands. \nDAN (cont'd) HEY ASSHOLES?! START THE CHAIR!!! WE'RE FREEZING UP HERE!!! \nPARKER What if they don't start it again? \nD What if everyone went home? \nDAN (angered out of panic) Will you stop?! \nE (recovering) They didn't go home. Stop freaking me out. (then) Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is horse shit. \nLYNCH What did you say to the guy? \nDAN Me?   Nothing! \nLYNCH Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this. \nDAN I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here. \nPARKER Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut \nX off the lights and scare the customers? \nDAN They just lost power or something. \nR I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second. (then) They didn't go home. That's retarded. \nA After a few more moments. \nLYNCH This is so messed up. \nM DAN It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to. \nParker is starting to whimper. In a few more seconds she may even be teetering on full-on panic. \nPARKER \nD We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?! \nE DAN Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out. \nAnother few beats. \nPARKER Don't yell at me. \nDAN I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night? \nLYNCH Free lift tickets. \nPARKER What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us. \nX She made a good point.   But still... \nDAN We won't be stuck here all night. \nR PARKER No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday. (she starts crying) Its fucking Sunday and they aren't \nA open again until Friday. (sobbing) We'll be stuck here all week. \nSilence as Dan and Lynch take this in. \nM PARKER (cont'd) We're gonna die up here. \nLynch tries to be the voice of reason. \nLYNCH We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even \nD if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the time. \nE DAN It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it. \nLooking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping off of the chair. \nPARKER (hysterical) -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!! \nShe cries into Dan's shoulder. \nThe wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather. \nR Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder. \nLYNCH SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE! \nA HELP! \nDAN (quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe. \nM LYNCH SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US! \nDAN (louder) Put the bar down. \nLYNCH \nD SOMEONE- \nDAN PUT THE BAR DOWN! \nE Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan. \nThe hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence. \nAnother loud thunder clap hits.   This time, much closer. \nCUT TO: \n22   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                          22 The sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below. \nSki tracks fill in with the wet rain. \nCUT TO: \n23   EXT.

Parker's hair is frozen. \nDAN (cont'd) We can't just sit up here until next weekend. We'll die. \nNo one acknowledges him. \nHe sighs and closes his eyes. \nParker starts to cry.   Neither of the guys even try to console her. \nFinally, Dan puts an arm around her. \nDAN (cont'd) Shhh.

BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            50 DAN -Parker, keep your coat on. \nE Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together. His fingers are so numb that it takes several tries. \nOnce tied, he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee, but it is useless. \nDAN (cont'd) Shit! \nLYNCH (O.C.) Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding. \nDAN I...I've got it. \nPARKER Are you sure. \nDan's left leg is definitely still bleeding. \nX DAN Yup. \nThunder shakes the mountain side. \nR Moments pass with only their breathing. \nLYNCH (O.C.)

You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy. \nX LYNCH There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it. \nDAN (O.C.) \nR You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it. \nLYNCH Even if I made it across to the \nA next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground? \nDAN (O.C.) Every lift pole has an emergency \n54   EXT.

How the hell...could this be worse? \nLong pause... \nX PARKER It could be the Sarlacc Pit. \nThey can't believe it...but Dan and Lynch both actually \nR laugh. It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's a laugh. \nLYNCH Parker- coming through with the \nA tension breaker, look out! (to Dan) She's alright, Walker. Your girl is alright. \nHe focuses on the task at hand again. \nM LYNCH (cont'd) OK...here we go. \nSlowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again. With one hand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of the chair, Lynch gets to his feet. Looking down at the drop, he instantly crouches down again. \nD LYNCH (cont'd) Holy shit, is that high up. \nPARKER \nE What can I do? \nLYNCH Nothing.   Just be quiet. \nHe psyches himself up again and starts to rise up. \nDAN (O.C.) You can do this, Lynch.     You've got it. \nLYNCH Please stop talking. \nHe puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but it slips off to the side. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Woa-! The whole back of this thing is ice. \nTogether, he and Parker start hitting the chair back. \nCUT TO: \nX 58   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            58 Shards of ice fall down around Dan.   He covers his head for \nR protection. \nLYNCH (O.C.) Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should \nA be able to reach the top. \nMore chunks of ice shower down around Dan. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Hey...go like this. \nX He motions wiping his face. \nParker follows suit, but winces in pain. \nPARKER \nR Ow!   It feels like...like sunburn. \nPieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove. \nLYNCH \nA I'm not an expert but I think that's frost bite. \nPARKER What? \nM LYNCH Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere? \nParker looks as closely as she can. \nPARKER I don't..I can't see anything.    I \nD don't know, it's too dark \nShe starts rubbing at her cheek again. \nLYNCH \nE No!   Stop touching it.   Don't touch it. \nPARKER But it itches now... \nLYNCH I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. \nParker is terrified. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Just try and cover your face.    Try and stay warm. \nStaying warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides her exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket. \nIcicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their clothing. \nDAN (O.C.) \nX (winded) You gotta move faster up there. \nLYNCH I'm trying man, I'm trying. \nR Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, which bends at an awkward angle. \nFrom above him we can see the long drop down, and as he \nA slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary. \nPARKER Careful. \nM LYNCH Stop talking. \nDAN (O.C.) Lynch.   I think the- \nLYNCH DAN, STOP TALKING. \nD Silence. \nLynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable.    It is frozen over with a thick layer of ice. \nE The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far now. \nLYNCH (cont'd) (to himself) I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this. \nSlowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full body weight on the back of the chair. \nThe bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm. \nLYNCH (cont'd) OK.    OK.   OK. \nHe starts to pull himself up onto the cable. \nPARKER Don't look down. \nX With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air. \nLYNCH \nR (gritted teeth) Slippery. \nM DON'T YOU FUCKING LET HER LOOK. \nLynch is trying to cover Parker's ears...but she can hear what they are saying. She forces her head free and steals a glance down. \nShe sees Dan's untimely death approaching and instantly starts to scream and cry. \nD Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves. \nLYNCH \nE Shhhh. Don't listen to it.        Don't listen. Don't listen. \nAs we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey. \nFirst one growl and a bite. \nDan shrieks in pain. \nDAN (O.C.) Don't let her look! \nBelow we can hear him put up a fight. But the attacks and bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful. \nDAN (O.C.) (cont'd) Don't look! Don't you fucking look down here! \nThe sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers his cries. \nX Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo through the night. \nThe sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and \nR bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below. \nDan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony. \nA The camera never sees it.   Only Lynch and Parker's faces. \nAfter what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from below begin to dissipate. \nEventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away. \nM Silence once again. \nFinally, Lynch let's go of Parker's head. He sobs into his own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the night. \nCUT TO: \nD 66   EXT.

CHAIR LIFT - MUCH LATER                                  67 Lynch and Parker sit on the frozen chair, shivering. \nThey are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after what must have been endless screaming and crying. Only the occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake. \nFinally Lynch breaks the silence. \nLYNCH I should...try and... \nHe starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to continue his climbing effort. \nPARKER (emotionless) Why did you let him jump? \nX Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief. \nLYNCH You can't be fucking serious. \nR PARKER It was too far. \nLYNCH He said he could do it. You didn't \nA try and stop him! (then) I can't believe this?! You're blaming me? \nPARKER \nM I'm not...I'm not blaming you. \nLYNCH You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him! \nPARKER \nD He wasn't going to listen to me. \nLYNCH Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I \nE said it was too far a drop! But I didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it! Don't you fucking blame me! You've been his girlfriend, for what? A year maybe?

Steve. \nSilence. \nM PARKER Shayna must be so hungry. \nLynch tries to change the subject. \nLYNCH What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's? \nD Parker doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow starts to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up. \nPARKER \nE The poor thing. She's just a puppy. She won't understand that I died. She's gonna think I left her. That I forgot about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She's probably waiting by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I'm going to walk in. But I won't. I won't ever walk in. And Shayna's going to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault. \nLYNCH She won't starve to death and you're not going to die. \nPARKER No one else has a key to my place. \nX LYNCH The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine. \nR (beat) And so will you. So will we. \nHe puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to shield the wind. \nA PARKER I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas. \nM LYNCH I know.   But you'll see her again. \nPARKER Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. (then) \nD I want to see my Mom and my Dad. (then) I want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can \nE eat. She's always late. But she brings all of the desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. And my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is over. And that's how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming. (MORE) PARKER(cont'd) It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again. (then) It's the same routine every year.

Their bodies are huddled \nM together, but neither is moving. \nIn fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles. \nPARKER Besides.   No one knows we're here. \nLYNCH (to the sky) HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!! \nX His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if taunting him. \nHe turns around to look at the chairs behind him. \nR LYNCH (cont'd) Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down. \nA Parker doesn't speak. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Help me. \nM PARKER Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today? \nLynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that \"no \nD one is coming\" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just a little while longer. \nLynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is making it almost impossible to scream. \nE LYNCH UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US! \nOnce again...only echoes. \nHe re-settles in his chair. \nPARKER I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute. \nLYNCH If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you. \nPARKER No.     I can't. \nLYNCH Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this. \nX PARKER (quickly, sternly) No. I'm fine. \nR LYNCH Alright. \nCUT TO: \nA 71   EXT.

His head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had. \nParker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking. \nFinally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed. \nHer snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch. \nBelow them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears. \nParker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated. \nAs her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it. \nShe doesn't even feel it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nX 73   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                        73 They both sleep. \nR Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing. \nIt appears she is not. \nA LYNCH Hey...hey Parker... \nHe lightly shakes her. \nM Nothing. \nX PARKER High School doesn't count. \nLYNCH \nR No, post-high school.   Freshmen year. \nPARKER Who? \nA LYNCH This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I \nM totally just felt it with her, you know? We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How cool is that? \nPARKER \nD What happened? \nLYNCH She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates \nE and that stuff you read about. \nPARKER So then... what happened? \nLYNCH Same old shit. (then) No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named \"Dean\" had left her notes and shit. \nPARKER Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous? \nLYNCH I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention. \nX PARKER So she dumped you for a frat guy? \nLYNCH \nR No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I \nA kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. So I was like, \"who are you laughing at?\" You know? Like \"what the hell is going on?\" And she's like, \"Dean's making fun of \nM you.\" (beat) So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my \nD girlfriend...but I couldn't see him. \nPARKER That's messed up. \nE LYNCH I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life. (then) So I left. \nPARKER You just walked out? \nLYNCH Yup. Told her to go laugh with \"Dean the Frat guy\". I was out. \nPARKER That sucks. \nLYNCH Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I \nX screwed up. \nPARKER You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that. \nR LYNCH I can't. (laughs) She's dating Dean. \nA Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again.   Parker and Lynch share a nervous laugh together. \nShe turns away from him. \nM After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears. \nPARKER I should have done something. \nLYNCH There was nothing either of us could have done. \nD PARKER I sat here and let him die. \nLYNCH \nE No, you didn't. We didn't let him die. There was nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us, OK? \nPARKER He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry. \nLYNCH Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little... \nParker laughs. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass. \nParker laughs harder. \nX LYNCH (cont'd) And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying \nR like a total pussy. \nThe metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place. \nLynch takes another move forward. \nLYNCH Rrrugh! \nPARKER You can do it. Please do it. \nLynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm. \nLYNCH \nX Arrrrr! \nPARKER JOE! \nR He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning. \nLYNCH (through gritted teeth) Got it. \nA Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway across to the next chair. \nFrom Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own \nM pained breathing fills his ears. \nIt's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him from the bushes. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Motherfucker. \nD The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and forth as he momentarily rests. \nLYNCH (cont'd) I've got an audience. \nE Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck back into the bushes. \nHer movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal that holds the arm in place. \nPARKER The chair is gonna fall! \nLYNCH No.    No it's not. \nSlowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair. \nHe drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below. \nHe quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair. \nLYNCH (cont'd) \nX Take that Jenny Bluth! \nPARKER You made it! \nR LYNCH Not yet.   Halfway. \nHe looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder! \nA LYNCH (cont'd) Please. \nHe stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is weak. \nM Very weak. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way. \nD She can't quite hear him. \nPARKER What? \nE LYNCH I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense. \nParker nods. \nShe takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as she can back at him. \nThe action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the motion. \nPARKER Oh shit. \nThe pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance between where she is and where the tree is. \nPARKER (cont'd) Sorry. \nLYNCH \nX Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right? (to himself) Shit. \nM waits. \nPARKER LYNCH!? LYNCH!!! (then) ANSWER ME!!! \nThe wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk \nD towards Lynch's body. \nOne step at a time. \nCUT TO: \nE 78   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                              78 As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded. \nHe feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or fractured in addition to being dislocated. \nLYNCH PARKER. \nPARKER (O.C.) ARE YOU OK? \nThe wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks. \nThe other wolves watch from the bushes. \nLYNCH I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE. \nX CUT TO: \n79   EXT.

His body is in massive pain, but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight \nM through it. \nHe moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair. \nThe leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back. \nD PARKER (O.C.) NO!   JOE! \nLYNCH I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP! \nE The wolf leader advances on Lynch. \nLynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature. \nLYNCH (cont'd) Come on!     Try something, fucker! \nThe wolf stares back at him, growling.      Their eyes are locked. \nLynch swings the pole at it angrily. \nLYNCH (cont'd) COME ON! \nThe leader shies away but growls harder. \nLYNCH (cont'd) STAY AWAY! \nSNAP! \nX A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth. \nLYNCH (cont'd) ARGH! \nR The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill. \nCUT TO: \nA 81   EXT.

This food still has some fight left in it. \nWHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, the \nR chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line. \nParker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is \nA dangling fully beneath it. \nWhile it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10 feet closer to the ground, if not more. \nCREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a few \nM seconds. The chair is going to fall! \nParker closes her eyes. \nAll sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her heartbeat. \nThe camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not \nD like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the wind. \nSlowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall. \nE The camera inches closer in to her face from below. \nHer heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally... \nShe let's go. \nAs her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down to the ground after her. \nCUT TO: \n87   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             87 THUD! Parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her. She rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot. \nX She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years. \nSurveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath \nR the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an unnatural angle. \nAdrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it. \nA She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. \nParker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can. \nM CUT TO: \n88   EXT. JUST OVER THE HILL - MORNING, CONTINUOUS                 88 Parker comes down the hill, gaining some speed on her awkward coat/sled. \nD As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it. \nCautiously she slows herself down. \nE PARKER (meekly) Joe...? \nFrom Parker's POV, the camera slowly reveals what is just beyond the bloody tree... \nBut the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to know first. \nThere, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree, is the pack of wolves. \nSome still feeding.   Others resting attentively. \nThey are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains. \nQuick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all flash before Parker's devastated eyes. \nShe slows herself to a complete stop now.   Not knowing what to do. \nOne of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see \nParker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader. \nLynch's blood pools from it's jaws. \nIt's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker. \nR She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. \nOthers from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. \nParker and the pack leader lock eyes. \nFinally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food. \n", "test1_input": "FROZEN \nWritten by \nAdam Green \nJanuary 28, 2009 \nEXT.

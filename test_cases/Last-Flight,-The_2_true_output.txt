Their eyes pop. The men jump up eagerly and run off. Nikki, thoroughly nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing. 
Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands. 
For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet. She walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary. 
NIKKI And now would you all excuse me? On account of I'm gonna put on a dress. 
CARY Well, why not? 
Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. The men continue to stand around the tray, drinking. In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa. 
Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps off the sofa. The others stare at him. 
SHEP My, my. What's HE getting so excited about? 
Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket. 
FRINK You guys think you're so darn smart. 
Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this. Cary consults his pocket watch. 
CARY Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off. 
Bill waves goodbye. Cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door. CARY See ya later. 
Cary exits as Nikki's voice drifts in from: 
THE OPEN BEDROOM DOORWAY 
NIKKI (o.s.) What are the plans for the day? 
Shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door. 
SHEP Well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer. 
NIKKI (o.s.) How about Cary? 
SHEP Went to get his hat and coat. He's going to Père Lachaise. 
NIKKI (o.s.) Père Lachaise? What's Père Lachaise? 
SHEP A cemetery. How 'bout you coming with us? 
NIKKI (o.s.) No. I'm going with Cary. 
SHEP (concerned) You've been invited? 
Nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out. 
NIKKI Do you think Cary might object? 
SHEP Well, I have an idea he'd like to be alone. 
NIKKI Why alone? 
SHEP Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's as brittle as a breadstick. One silly crack from you and he might break up in sections. 
NIKKI (thinks about this) Well, then, I don't think he should be left alone. (beat) Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris? 
SHEP What are we all doing in Paris? 
NIKKI I know. But why doesn't he go home? 
SHEP Well, he's not ready to go home. What could he do if he went home? Have people cry over his hands? 
NIKKI Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this. He's such a sweet soul. 
SHEP One of the best. 
NIKKI Isn't he just sort of wasting himself? 
SHEP On the contrary. He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself. 
Lost in thought, Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows her to: 
THE FRONT DOOR Shep stops Nikki from leaving. She's a little downcast as he admonishes her: 
SHEP Now, listen. If you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say. Don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him. (with a chuckle) And, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear? 
NIKKI (earnest) Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of such a thing? 
Nikki opens the front door and exits into: 
THE HALLWAY where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki calling to him. She runs to join him.

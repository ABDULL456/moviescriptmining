-- FROM THE CAMP -- one more   ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS as the weapons depot finally BLOWS,   TEARING OPEN the face of the mountain; everyone flinches,   JOLTED, as a last THUNDEROUS BOOM ECHOES HARD against the   canyon walls -- 
A QUIET RUMBLING starts to resound all around... 
The Soldiers all turn, looking up -- Caesar and the apes turn as well -- to see -- 
AN AVALANCHE OF SNOW AND ROCK AND EARTH GATHERING STEAM IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THEM. 
And it's heading their way -- 
A HUMAN VOICE CRIES OUT AVALAAAAAAANCHE...!!! 
Mad scrambling begins -- Soldiers leaping from the trucks, futilely running in all directions across the canyon floor -- 
When Caesar, on instinct, suddenly CRIES OUT TO HIS APES -- WAVING THEM ON FIERCELY -- as he does the unthinkable -- tearing off with simian speed -- TOWARD THE AVALANCHE...! 
AND THE APES FOLLOW -- CAESAR LEADING THEM EN MASSE, RACING UP THE MOUNTAIN...! 
CUT TO: 
HALFWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - IMMEDIATELY 
Maurice, Nova, and the ape children turn abruptly -- staring wide-eyed at the growing TSUNAMI OF SNOW billowing right toward them! 
Eyes darting, Maurice fixes on the TALL TREES beside them -- he BELLOWS out to them -- and all at once -- everyone makes a break for them -- climbing up -- just as the AVALANCHE ARRIVES -- ! 
SMASH TO: 
CAESAR AND THE APES RUNNING - FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN 
They LAUNCH themselves up into the trees -- moving higher -- higher -- 
-- as the AVALANCHE SUDDENLY SURGES below, the WAVE OF SNOW RISING toward them -- as they frantically climb to avoid it!!! 
SUPER WIDE - ABOVE THE CANYON - IMMEDIATELY 
THE MONUMENTAL AVALANCHE CRASHES APOCALYPTICALLY to the canyon floor, THE ROILING SNOW BEGINNING TO ENGULF the BURNING CAMP, THE SOLDIERS, THE TRUCKS, EVERYTHING IN SIGHT -- 
SMASH TO: 
CAESAR REACHING THE TREE TOP 
as the RISING RUSH OF SNOW begins to wash violently over him! 
TIGHT ON CAESAR 
CLINGING to the trunk, an elemental fight against the RAGING WHITENESS -- holding on for life as snow HOWLS DEAFENINGLY around him, ripping at his body... until finally, as quickly as it began, the tide subsides... suddenly leaving us in -- 
A STUNNING SILENCE. 
Caesar peers around in a daze to find himself in a SURREAL HAZE OF WHITE, as if in a heavenly cloud... And slowly, the mist begins to clear... 
Caesar stares down from the tree top to discover an incredible sight below... 
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ARE GONE, THE ENTIRE CANYON BURIED IN PRISTINE SNOW... It's as if nothing was ever here. 
He stares for a moment in disbelief -- when sounds of apes ECHO through the landscape -- he lifts his head to see -- 
THE APES, all clinging to the tree tops all around him. They look at him, their savior, the chorus of ape sounds growing louder... more exuberant... triumphant. They raise their fists in solidarity and tribute to Caesar... 
A smile begins to spread across Caesar's face, as he raises a weary fist back to them, we -- 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
A SERIES OF EPIC 65MM SUPER-WIDE LANDSCAPES, DAVID LEAN-STYLE 
THE APE EXODUS moving on foot across SNOWY PLAINS... 
CLOSER ON CAESAR as he pulls Bad Ape's blanket tighter around Cornelius and himself, shielding them both from the cold. We HOLD on Caesar's face, etched with strain, but determination too... 
through the sands of STUNNING MOJAVE DESERT VISTAS... 
...until they reach what looks like a vast, arid wasteland, passing the outskirts of a DECIMATED NUCLEAR POWER PLANT... 
MOVE CLOSER 
As Caesar, Cornelius on his shoulder, walks with the others past a huge, rusted SIGN: "FORBIDDEN ZONE." Caesar looks to Rocket, uncertain... but Rocket points reassuringly ahead... at a DISTANT DESERT VOLCANO. As they continue onward, we -- 
DISSOLVE AGAIN TO: 
THE TOP OF THE DESERT VOLCANO 
The mass of apes scaling up, and finally cresting over the lip... Caesar pauses momentarily in shock, and then we PAN with him as he and the others step forward to REVEAL: 
A GORGEOUS LUSHLY-OVERGROWN GREEN CRATER, a CRYSTAL BLUE LAKE at its center; a kind of paradise, a place to begin again... 
Exhausted, Caesar has to sit for a moment on one of the mossy rocks, taking in the beauty as the apes excitedly pass, exploring the incredible landscape of their new home... 
Maurice arrives beside him, Nova on his back; Cornelius peeks curiously over his father's shoulder, fascinated with her. She smiles shyly, when a bunch of ape children race playfully past, jostling and scurrying. Both turn, watching them go. 
Then Nova hops off Maurice, eager to join in the fun. She pauses, turning back to Cornelius, holding out a hand... 
Cornelius climbs carefully down, then stops, looking up uncertainly at Caesar, not sure if he's ready yet to leave his father's side. Touched, Caesar smiles down at his son; he kneels before him, caressing his face gently, filled with great emotion... then he nods gently for him to go play -- and he and Nova hurry off.

The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement. 
VX8   EXT.   X-MANSION - DAY                                                VX8

REPORTER (O.S.) Breaking news. A multicar collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway... 
The sign sits on the perfectly manicured front lawn of the gorgeous Gothic X-MANSION. 
VX8   INT.   KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                         VX8 
The X-Men's COLOSSUS. A GOOD-NATURED GIANT with CHROME METAL FOR SKIN. BIG AS A BARN. OTHER-WORLDLY STRONG. He is sitting in the kitchen, eating a bowl of GRAPE NUTS and finishing a SUDOKU, his attention suddenly drawn to a TELEVISION SCREEN: 
REPORTER The assailant appears to be wearing a... 
COLOSSUS                      REPORTER (CONT'D) Red suit?                            Red suit. 
With an audible CRACK, the pencil in Colossus' thick fingers snaps. He rises, muttering Russian curses and stalks from the kitchen. 
VC8   INT.   HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER                                       VC8 
Massive STEEL BLAST DOORS emblazoned with a huge "X" slide open to reveal COLOSSUS. He walks quickly and purposefully towards a big plane in the center of the huge space: the BLACKBIRD, the X-Men's modified XR-71 jet transport. 
Struggling to keep up with the giant's long strides is a supernaturally CUTE, supernaturally DEADPAN 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL, in an X-MEN outfit. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD. 
COLOSSUS I've given Deadpool every chance to join us. And what is my reward? More immaturity and criminality! When will he finally grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man? 
NTW Like... The house that blows up every few years? The fashion-forward jump-suits? I need to get myself kicked out of X- School. 
COLOSSUS But I thought you were at top of class.

NTW Was that sarcasm?    Awesome. 
COLOSSUS You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. (hands NTW a protein bar) Here. Protein bar, good for bones. Deadpool may try to break yours. 
NTW shoves the bar in a pocket of her coat without breaking stride. 
9     EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - MORNING                                        9 
The S.U.V. slides to a halt ON ITS SIDE, PASSENGER WINDOWS UP. The rest of the CONVOY is forced to stop BEHIND. 
A BUNCH of MEN PILE OUT, each one carrying a BEASTLY GUN and POINTING it STRAIGHT at the disabled S.U.V. 
The last noise is made by one final dislodged HUBCAP, which rattles in little circles until it lies FLAT on the freeway. 
TWO SILENT BEATS. Then we hear the soft, ELECTRIC BUZZ of the Escalade's middle passenger window ROLLING DOWN. Up pops the HEAD of DEADPOOL, like the GOPHER in Caddyshack. 
BANG BANG BANG BANG. 
DEADPOOL Wait, wait... 
The head drops, the hands come up.        BANG. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wait! You're probably wondering. Why the red suit? It's so bad guys can't see me bleed. This guy has the idea. He wore the brown pants. (to camera) All together now... 
The THUGS immediately OPEN FIRE. 
Deadpool is already leaping upward, flipping backwards, bullets tearing the air beneath him as he pulls out those TWO MASSIVE .50 CAL PISTOLS... and in slo-mo, RETURNS FIRE. 
Deadpool keeps count of every bullet he fires: 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Twelve..!

A SHELL-CASING is EJECTED. We enter EXTREME SLO-MO and SWOOP IN on the shell as it TUMBLES through the air... 
...revealing the number `00012' ETCHED in a semi-circle on its butt end. Deadpool FIRES the second pistol. We move instantly to the second shell: `00011' 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Eleven... 
FULL SPEED.    The first TWO THUGS get a MOUTHFUL of BULLET. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ten... 
ANOTHER SHOT. A THUG takes one in the HEART.          The other thugs POUR LEAD into the disabled S.U.V. 
Deadpool LEAPS UP and OUT of the window, rising ABOVE the incoming shots, then LANDING SAFELY BEHIND the Escalade. 
Deadpool TURNS to SPY a MOTORCYCLE RIDER BEARING DOWN ON HIM. This rider wears a distinctive SILVER HELMET. 
Deadpool raises BOTH pistols. This RIDER LEANS away, dodging each slug. First left, then right, then left. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nine.    Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven.       Shit- fuck!

RUFUS 
I think we're beyond euphemisms at this point. 
(to Bethany) 
God's a skee-ball fanatic. 
METATRON 
Let's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright? 
(to Bethany) 
Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years - He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children. Isn't that sweet? 
BETHANY 
But She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're getting at? 
METATRON 
(to Rufus) 
'She'? I take it she's met the Muse. 
(to Bethany) 
No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her. 
RUFUS 
Maybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback. 
M ETAT RON 
No - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion - He's trapped in a body. 
RUFUS 
So God's not dead... 
JAY 
He's brain dead. 
METATRON 
So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves. 
RUFUS 
Can it be Lucifer? 
METATRON 
Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as everyone else. 
RUFUS 
Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets? 
METATRON 
Don't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one. 
JAY 
(excited) 
Yeah? 
Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads. 
BETHANY 
Don't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a test? 
METATRON 
No, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough - how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God belonged on the back of a milk carton? 
RUFUS 
So what do we do now? 
M ETAT RON 
I say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas. 
JAY 
(off paper) 
Why don't we just ask this guy to close the church? 
METATRON 
I beg your pardon? 
JAY 
Here. 
(hands group the paper) 
BETHANY 
(reading) 
'Glick Takes Heat for Campaign'? 
JAY 
It's the guy in charge of the church thing. 
BETHANY 
(reading) 
'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded "Come on - who doesn't like a pool party?" 
JAY 
Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right? 
METATRON 
Good Lord - he's got a point. 
BETHANY 
I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the situation somehow. 
RUFUS 
'We'? You're back in? 
BETHANY 
Well, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the family. 
(smiles) 
METATRON 
(off Silent Bob) 
Well, well, well - the prophets finally live up to their titles. 
Silent Bob shrugs. Jay is trying to look down Serendipity's shirt. She back-hands him. 
TELEVISION SCREEN - COMMERCIAL 
Two cartoon ALTAR BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal. 
ALTAR 1 
The same boring cereal again? 
A cheesy CARTOON CHRIST floats down from above. 
CHRIST 
Man cannot live on boring cereal alone! 
ALTAR I & 2 
IT'S JESUS! 
Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash. 
CHRIST 
Why not try Hosties! 
CL on cereal pouring into a bowl. It's shaped like Eucharistic hosts. Milk follows.

MONTY (CONT'D) 
Okay? 
She grabs him and holds him very hard, clutching him, sobbing into his neck. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry for everything. 
NATURELLE 
No . . . 
MONTY 
Fo r everything .

He kisses her again and releases her, walks out the apartment door and closes it behind him. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Monty unknots the plastic bag and dumps the ice down the stairwell. The cubes glitter and disappear before clattering on the linoleum three floors below. 
EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING 
Mr. Brogan's car is double-parked. The roof of the old Honda is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have been swept clean. 
INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA 
Mr. Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully into the seat, then leans over to unlock the driver's door. After Mr. Brogan starts the engine, they wait for a moment for the windows to defrost. 
MR. BROGAN 
FDR is closed. I figured we'd go up First, take the Triborough, catch 87 up to Route 17, and then 211 takes us right into Otisville. Easy drive, except for the snow. Monty says nothing, and Mr. Brogan studies his savaged face. 
MR. BROGAN (CONT'D) 
Jesus, look what they did to you. I'll tell you what, Monty, you're gonna be okay. It looks bad now, I know it, but when all the swelling goes down it's -          · - gonna be okayr     ~ ~"    ··-·-· ······-· 
(beat) They sure gave you a licking, though. How many were there? 
MONTY 
I don't know, Dad. A bunch of them. 
MR. BROGAN 
Well, give it a month and you'll be better looking than ever. A fire truck rolls slowly past, chains on its massive tires. Monty and his father sit in silence, letting the engine warm.

MONTY 
You were right, Dad. It wasn't Naturelle. Mr. Brogan shifts into drive. 
MR. BROGAN 
Of course it wasn't Naturelle. 
EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- DAWN 
Slattery sits on a park bench overlooking the river. It's the same bench Monty sat on the day before. Slattery is alone on the snow-covered esplanade. His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is marked with blood. He watches the sun rise over Queens. 
EXT. EAST END AVENUE -- DAWN 
Jakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid- twenties, schusses toward them on cross-country skis. She smiles at Jakob as she passes. 
SKIER 
Cool dog. 
JAKOB 
Thanks. He turns and watches her glide down the hill toward 86th Street. He looks down: at Doyle. Doyle looks-iap- at ~hifff. TM   - 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Cool dog. Jakob shakes his head and smiles, and they continue walking south. 
INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING 
They drive up First Avenue. Monty looks out the window and watches the city roll by. It's his last look for a long time, and he wants to remember everything. A WOMAN wearing a man's overcoat sprinkles salt in front of a shuttered butcher shop. Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds behind them, huffing and puffing with exaggerated fatigue.

CONTINUED: 
A NEWSPAPER VENDOR sits on a blue milk crate, sipping coffee from a paper cup, while his CURLY-HAIRED SON snaps icicles from the kiosk's eaves. A POLICE OFFICER, hands on his hips, stares under the opened hood of his cruiser, while his PARTNER leans against the driver's-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie. At a red light, Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily alongside them. A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves. Monty waves back. The boy points at his window: letters have been finger-drawn on the frosted glass. T-O-M. Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his own frosted window: M-O-N- Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away. They drive north. 
MONTY 
I always thought I'd make you proud of me . M r . Brogan turns to look at Monty and then turns back to the road. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
I pictured it, you know? I pictured you sitting at the bar with all your friends, poker night, and you'd say, "Did I tell you what my boy's been up to?" And your friends would be like, "Goddamnit, _ Brogan,,_all you ever talk about-is your     ,,...      _, __,, _ boy." 
MR. BROGAN 
Give me the word and I'll take a left turn. 
MONTY 
Left turn to where? 
MR. BROGAN . 
Wherever you want. Take the GW Bridge and go west. Monty stares at his father.

Get you stitched up somewhere and keep going. Find a nice little town --

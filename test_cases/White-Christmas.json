{"test1_input": "THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now another does. \nCLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH \nThe hand is approaching midnight. \nCLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER \nHe is looking at his wristwatch. \nCLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH \nThe second hand is pointing to the hour. \nFULL SHOT OF SCENE \nThis is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A shell BURSTS in the vicinity. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nPhil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SKY - (NIGHT) \nCAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion lights up the screen.  Over scene SUPERIMPOSE: \n12-A. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER \nHeadline reads: \"V-E DAY!\" \nAs CAMERA MOVES FAST INTO headline, we LOSE the fireworks display and the headline covers the whole screen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n12-B. \nINSERT - CHURCH TOWERS - (DAY) \nBells are ringing for celebration of V-E Day.

CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production number \"BELLS\". \nMED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE \nPerhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida. \nFULL SHOT - AUDIENCE \nAPPLAUDING the conclusion of the number. \nMED. FULL SHOT - BACKSTAGE \nThe curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up on the next number, which is dancing.  Phil and Bob are met by COOKE, the Company Manager. \n", "test1_true": "COOKE (To Bob and Phil) New York's on the telephone. \nBob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone. \nPHIL (Into phone) Hello. (He listens.  To Bob and Cooke) Oscar. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE \nThis is the business office of Bob and Phil.  OSCAR is their representative and manager, not their employer. \nHe is sixty and looks competent.  He refers to a telegram in his hand.  Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall.  It must be evident from their billing that the boys are important stars in New York. \nOSCAR Listen, I just heard what you're doing -- giving the cast a week off with pay for Christmas.  You don't know how touched I am.  I'm all choked up.  Between sobs, I managed to book you on the Ed Harrison show this week to take up the slack.  It'll be stealing money. \n17A. \nCLOSE SHOT - GROUP \nPhil is holding the receiver up to Bob.  Oscar's VOICE can be plainly heard. \nPHIL (Into phone) We'll have to go to New York -- four days and four nights of rehearsals -- that's stealing money? \n17B. \nCLOSE SHOT - OSCAR \nAs he speaks into the telephone \nOSCAR It is for me  -- I get ten percent. (He listens for a moment) Next time you guys make a charitable gesture, find out if you got with what to make it.  See you Wednesday. \nHe hangs up. \nGROUP SHOT - PHIL, BOB AND COOKE \nBob hangs up the phone. \nBOB Well... while the cast takes it easy we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie. \nCOOKE What train do you want?  There's a one-thirty this morning but you have to sit up all night. \nPHIL Let's get out tonight. \nBOB Okay. \nThe boys walk to their dressing room.  A group of the chorines come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing. They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all. \nPHIL What are we going to do until one- thirty? \nBOB We'll eat dinner. \nPHIL (Looking at the retreating bouncing) Eat, eat  All you think of is your stomach! \nRita shows up in front of Phil. \nRITA (Eagerly) You said you had something to rehearse with me after the show.  What is it? \nPhil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self- conscious at being caught. \nPHIL It's a kind of new dance number. \n", "test1_id": 150, "test2_input": "RITA (Eagerly) I'm ready. \nBOB (Taking Phil by the arm) He isn't.  Some business has come up.  See you in a week. (He pulls Phil away) Come on, Romeo, dinner! (Tempting him) Lamb chops, lamb chops! \nPHIL (Pretending that he is letting himself be pulled while he is still anxious to go in the other direction) I'm looking at them!  We're going in the wrong direction. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED. SHOT - WATERFRONT INN - BOB AND PHIL - (NIGHT) \nThe boys are now finishing their dinner.  Bob is facing the orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it.  The MUSIC plays, the boys eat.  The table is close to the bar.  On two stools sit JUDY and BETTY.  Betty is wearing her glasses and examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed her by the bartender.  Phil is not paying attention to his eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over the bar stool.  Bob cannot see the girls and is not even interested enough to turn around. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nOn her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is unobtrusively sizing up Phil. \nBETTY (Checking the tickets) We'll have to rush to get the 1:30 train. \nCLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND BOB \nBob notices Phil's absorption. \nBOB Have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile? \nPHIL What other kind is there? (He picks up the card which announces the performers names and reads) 'The Stewart Sisters.'  Sister act! (He smacks his lips. He doesn't realize that these two girls are the Stewart Sisters) \nBOB Down, Rover, down.  Remember, we have an agreement--you chase no new tidbits during the season.  You were man enough to give me your hand on it. \nPHIL You were sneaky enough to take it. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nBetty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly eyeing Phil.  She leans forward. \nBETTY (Quietly) Ahem. (Judy's eyes are toward Phil.  A little louder) Ahem!  All right dear, relax. \nJUDY He's awful cute. \nBETTY So was the one in Kansas City, and the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one in Waco, Texas. \nJUDY (Mock seriousness) Canton, Ohio wasn't so much. \nBETTY One of these days you're going to meet somebody extra cute and the next performance I'll be doing a single. \nJUDY (Sincerely) Nobody'll ever be cute enough to break up this sister act. \nMED. SHOT - BOOTH - BOB AND PHIL \nPhil is still fingering the card. \nPHIL I haven't much luck with sister acts. They're all alike.  Shall I tell you what these two are like? \nBOB Shoot. \nPHIL Four feet two inches tall.  Pudgy. Round races.  Have big bows in their hair.  Always smiling. (He parodies a smile) Lots of teeth.  Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else.  Two, three hundred teeth at a time.  The American Dental Association is investigating it. \nThere is a drum roll from the orchestra.  Betty takes off her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar.  The bandleader's voice announces: \nBANDLEADER Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart Sisters! \nThe audience applauds politely while the girls start toward the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development. \n", "test2_true": "PLATFORM - FULL SHOT \nBetty and Judy do their number: \"SISTERS\".  As they take their bows -- \nMED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nPhil pretends to recognize Judy. \nPHIL Say, Dolores!  That's Dolores! \nBOB Who? \nPHIL Remember that girl I told you about who got sick in St. Paul?  That's her!  The girl in the oxygen tent! I told you about her!  The road company of \"Student Prince.\"  The whole company went to church and prayed for her!  It was the most touching thing I've ever seen in show business. \n(HE GETS UP.) I'll bring her over. \nHe goes, Bob watching, disgusted.  NOVELLO, the owner of the Waterfront Inn, comes up. \nMED. SHOT - BOB AND NOVELLO \nNovello evidently knows Bob. \nNOVELLO Didn't you get your dessert yet, Mr. Wallace? \nBOB I'm not having any, but I think my partner's lining up some pastries now. \nNOVELLO Sure wish I could afford to book you boys here. \nBOB Call our agent - we've got half an hour between trains. \nPhil enters the shot with Judy and Betty. \nPHIL Hello, Mister Novello. \nNOVELLO Good evening, Mister Davis. \nMED. SHOT - GROUP \nNovello pulls out the table to permit the girls to be seated. \nPHIL (Burlesque formality) Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace. Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace. \nJUDY AND BETTY How do you do. \nBOB (Rising) How do you do. \nPhil gets Betty next to Bob, he sits next to Judy. \nNOVELLO See you later, folks. \nPHIL 'Bye. (He leaves) \nJUDY We saw your show at the matinee, and we liked it very much. \nBOB Thank you, ma'am. \nThe orchestra has gone into WHITE CHRISTMAS. \nPHIL Where are you going to be for Christmas? \n", "test2_id": 151, "test3_input": "BOB Oh yes! \nPHIL Can't we go tomorrow? \nBOB The train goes tonight. (Phil looks disconsolately at Judy) Say goodbye to the lady bubble, because we're going to have to run for it now. \nPHIL Lady bubble, I have an idea we're going to meet up again sometime. \nJUDY We might, we're on the same train. \nPHIL No. \nJUDY Yes. \nBOB (Pulling Phil away) No. \nAs they start off, Novello enters to the girls, agitated. \nNOVELLO The sheriff is here! He's in my office! \nJUDY The sheriff! \nNOVELLO He's got a warrant to arrest you! \nBob has stopped.  He looks at Phil, suspiciously. \nBOB I thought we watched you every minute. \nPhil holds up his hand in \"Scout's honor.\" \nPHIL Never stopped dancing. \nBob turns back to the table. \nBOB (To the girls) Can we help? \nJUDY (Fearful) I've never been arrested! \nPHIL There's nothing to it! \nBOB Don't get panicky! \nNOVELLO Yes, don't get excited, you still have to give your show! (Apologetically) He's not going to arrest them until after the show! \nBOB That's considerate!  How'd you arrange that? \nNOVELLO I'm a taxpayer here!  You better go in and change, girls!  You haven't much time! \nThe girls start off, confused.  Novello, Bob and Phil follow. \nBOB May I enquire what you are being arrested for? \nBETTY The owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it. \nJUDY We couldn't have dropped a cigarette because we don't smoke. \nBETTY He wants two hundred dollars, but it's just plain stealing. \nJUDY We left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed. \nBETTY Then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot. \n", "test3_true": "NOVELLO You have to give another show. \nHe leaves them, as Bob and Phil look unpleasantly after him. They have reached the wings. \nINT. WINGS - MED. SHOT \nSTAGEHAND is setting up a record on a record-playing mechanism backstage, as the group passes by heading for the dressing rooms. \nPHIL The old burned rug routine. \nBOB Kind of old fashioned, isn't it? I thought that went out with the Cherry Sisters. We'll have to do something. \nPHIL (Hopefully) Got a flash? \nBOB A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a little. \nThe girls have opened the door to their dressing room. \nJUDY We wouldn't want you boys to get into any trouble. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - MED.

SHOT \nNovello is with the SHERIFF and the LANDLORD.  The Sheriff is a husky fellow. At the moment he's eating an eclair and coffee, from Novello's desk.  The Landlord glares at him. \nLANDLORD That's the second dessert you've had, Sheriff! \nSHERIFF Real good, too. \nLANDLORD I haven't got all night to wait here while you eat free food!  You've got your warrant, arrest those girls! \nSHERIFF (Displeased) Now, we agreed to let them finish their show first. \nLANDLORD I didn't agree! (To Novello) That was his idea! \nNOVELLO I've got some rights, too.  You don't get those girls until after they've done their number! \nLANDLORD Well, how long is it going to take? \nNovello puts his hand up, listening. \nNOVELLO Wait a minute! That's their music! \nHe gets up, opens the office door, and we HEAR their entrance music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, \"The Stewart Sisters.\" \nMED.

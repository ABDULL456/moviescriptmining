{"train": "WHITE CHRISTMAS \n\"WHITE CHRISTMAS\" \nby \nMelvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama \nFULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS) \nThis is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre. \nIn the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows the effects of battle. \nIn the foreground is a recreation area, covered with camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage. Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby. \nMED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA \nWe can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON. \nJEEP - MED. CLOSE \nAs it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean and fresh from the Pentagon. \nHe is staring off at the recreation area. \nGENERAL CARLTON (To Adjutant) What's this all about, Colonel? \nADJUTANT (Turning) A little entertainment for the men, sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve. \nGENERAL CARLTON These men are moving up tonight. They should be lined up for full inspection! \nThe jeep has come to a halt. \nGENERAL WAVERLY (Eyeing him) You're absolutely right. (To Adjutant) There's no Christmas in the Army, Colonel. \nADJUTANT Yes, sir. \nWaverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep. \nGENERAL WAVERLY (To Carlton) There's always a slip-up or two during a change in command.  The men get a little loose.  But I know I'm leaving them in good hands. \nGENERAL CARLTON (Stiffly) Thank you. (To Driver) Sergeant, take me to headquarters immediately!  We'll have those men turned out on the double! \nThe Sergeant looks at General Waverly. \nGENERAL WAVERLY Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short cut. \nSERGEANT Yes, sir! \nThe jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him. \nTWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT \nThe Adjutant turns to him. \nADJUTANT That's not the way to headquarters! \nGENERAL WAVERLY Joe, you know that, and I know that, but the new General doesn't know it. Or he won't for about an hour and a half. \nADJUTANT That Sergeant'll be a private tomorrow! \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now another does. \nCLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH \nThe hand is approaching midnight. \nCLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER \nHe is looking at his wristwatch. \nCLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH \nThe second hand is pointing to the hour. \nFULL SHOT OF SCENE \nThis is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A shell BURSTS in the vicinity. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nPhil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SKY - (NIGHT) \nCAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion lights up the screen.  Over scene SUPERIMPOSE: \n12-A. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER \nHeadline reads: \"V-E DAY!\" \nAs CAMERA MOVES FAST INTO headline, we LOSE the fireworks display and the headline covers the whole screen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n12-B. \nINSERT - CHURCH TOWERS - (DAY) \nBells are ringing for celebration of V-E Day.  CAMERA MOVES INTO mouth of one bell, blacking out the screen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BILL POSTER OF FLORIDA SHOW - (NIGHT) \nfeaturing names and pictures of Bob and Phil.  CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production number \"BELLS\". \nMED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE \nPerhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida. \nFULL SHOT - AUDIENCE \nAPPLAUDING the conclusion of the number. \nMED. FULL SHOT - BACKSTAGE \nThe curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up on the next number, which is dancing.  Phil and Bob are met by COOKE, the Company Manager. \nRITA (Eagerly) I'm ready. \nBOB (Taking Phil by the arm) He isn't.  Some business has come up.  See you in a week. (He pulls Phil away) Come on, Romeo, dinner! (Tempting him) Lamb chops, lamb chops! \nPHIL (Pretending that he is letting himself be pulled while he is still anxious to go in the other direction) I'm looking at them!  We're going in the wrong direction. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED. SHOT - WATERFRONT INN - BOB AND PHIL - (NIGHT) \nThe boys are now finishing their dinner.  Bob is facing the orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it.  The MUSIC plays, the boys eat.  The table is close to the bar.  On two stools sit JUDY and BETTY.  Betty is wearing her glasses and examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed her by the bartender.  Phil is not paying attention to his eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over the bar stool.  Bob cannot see the girls and is not even interested enough to turn around. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nOn her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is unobtrusively sizing up Phil. \nBETTY (Checking the tickets) We'll have to rush to get the 1:30 train. \nCLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND BOB \nBob notices Phil's absorption. \nBOB Have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile? \nPHIL What other kind is there? (He picks up the card which announces the performers names and reads) 'The Stewart Sisters.'  Sister act! (He smacks his lips. He doesn't realize that these two girls are the Stewart Sisters) \nBOB Down, Rover, down.  Remember, we have an agreement--you chase no new tidbits during the season.  You were man enough to give me your hand on it. \nPHIL You were sneaky enough to take it. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nBetty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly eyeing Phil.  She leans forward. \nBETTY (Quietly) Ahem. (Judy's eyes are toward Phil.  A little louder) Ahem!  All right dear, relax. \nJUDY He's awful cute. \nBETTY So was the one in Kansas City, and the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one in Waco, Texas. \nJUDY (Mock seriousness) Canton, Ohio wasn't so much. \nBETTY One of these days you're going to meet somebody extra cute and the next performance I'll be doing a single. \nJUDY (Sincerely) Nobody'll ever be cute enough to break up this sister act. \nMED. SHOT - BOOTH - BOB AND PHIL \nPhil is still fingering the card. \nPHIL I haven't much luck with sister acts. They're all alike.  Shall I tell you what these two are like? \nBOB Shoot. \nPHIL Four feet two inches tall.  Pudgy. Round races.  Have big bows in their hair.  Always smiling. (He parodies a smile) Lots of teeth.  Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else.  Two, three hundred teeth at a time.  The American Dental Association is investigating it. \nThere is a drum roll from the orchestra.  Betty takes off her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar.  The bandleader's voice announces: \nBANDLEADER Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart Sisters! \nThe audience applauds politely while the girls start toward the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development. \nBOB Oh yes! \nPHIL Can't we go tomorrow? \nBOB The train goes tonight. (Phil looks disconsolately at Judy) Say goodbye to the lady bubble, because we're going to have to run for it now. \nPHIL Lady bubble, I have an idea we're going to meet up again sometime. \nJUDY We might, we're on the same train. \nPHIL No. \nJUDY Yes. \nBOB (Pulling Phil away) No. \nAs they start off, Novello enters to the girls, agitated. \nNOVELLO The sheriff is here! He's in my office! \nJUDY The sheriff! \nNOVELLO He's got a warrant to arrest you! \nBob has stopped.  He looks at Phil, suspiciously. \nBOB I thought we watched you every minute. \nPhil holds up his hand in \"Scout's honor.\" \nPHIL Never stopped dancing. \nBob turns back to the table. \nBOB (To the girls) Can we help? \nJUDY (Fearful) I've never been arrested! \nPHIL There's nothing to it! \nBOB Don't get panicky! \nNOVELLO Yes, don't get excited, you still have to give your show! (Apologetically) He's not going to arrest them until after the show! \nBOB That's considerate!  How'd you arrange that? \nNOVELLO I'm a taxpayer here!  You better go in and change, girls!  You haven't much time! \nThe girls start off, confused.  Novello, Bob and Phil follow. \nBOB May I enquire what you are being arrested for? \nBETTY The owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it. \nJUDY We couldn't have dropped a cigarette because we don't smoke. \nBETTY He wants two hundred dollars, but it's just plain stealing. \nJUDY We left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed. \nBETTY Then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot. \nSHERIFF Take my friends where they want to go! \nHANK Yes, sir. \nSHERIFF Hurry up! \nBOB (Going out the window) Thanks, Pete. \nEXT. WINDOW - POLICE CAR \nHank has thrown the door open. \nPHIL Do you think we can make it? \nHANK This thing goes over a hundred an hour!  Hold on! \nHe starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, and tires grinding. \nMED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM \nThe Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the door, takes out his key and opens it. \nMED. SHOT - CORRIDOR \nThe Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the departing police car, the noise having distracted them from the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating. The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to him, faces alight. \nSHERIFF They escaped!  We're pursuing 'em! \nLANDLORD Escaped! \nSHERIFF (Pointing) What do you mean smoking on theatrical premises! \nLANDLORD That's not mine!  I wasn't smoking! \nSHERIFF What's that burning?  A lollypop? (He grabs him by the shoulder, not too gently, and starts him out) Come on! \nHe protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STATION - (NIGHT) \nThe train is already moving as the police car arrives. \nThe girls are on the observation platform.  The police car screams to a stop.  The boys fly out, with bags, and just make the train, the girls pulling them aboard. \nJUDY (Seriously) You didn't steal the police car? \nPHIL No, no.  Friend of ours. \nThey go toward the lounge car. \nMED. SHOT - INT. LOUNGE CAR - GROUP \nThey all take seats in the lounge car, happy to have accomplished their escape. \nBOB Well, we'll be together as far as New York. \nBETTY Maybe it'll snow in New York for Christmas.  If it doesn't, we'll mail you a snowball from Vermont. \nJUDY I haven't been on ice skates in years. \nWIPE TO: \nMED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE \nThe bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping platform. \nWIPE TO: \nMED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE \nStill another turn of the bus, and in the distance we see a LONG SHOT of the Columbia Inn. \nMED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN \nMARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk. \nThe door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying the mail, walks toward her. \nSUSAN Mail, Martha. \nShe puts the mail on the desk. \nMARTHA (As she shuffles through it) What's the weather forecast down at the Post Office? \nSUSAN Awful.  Fair and warmer. \nMARTHA If we don't get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house. We haven't had a guest for three weeks. \nSUSAN (As Martha keeps searching through the mail) What are you looking for? \nMARTHA (Not finding it) Your grandfather's written Washington asking if he can get back in active service.  I think he wants to fly jets. \nSUSAN I think he could do it. \nMARTHA He says older men have been called, and besides, he misses the food.  I tell you, Susan, he tried to make it a casual letter, with little jokes, but it came out just begging. \nThrough the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow. \nHis back is to CAMERA. \nSUSAN (Moved) Oh, Martha!  What are we going to do? \nMARTHA (Blowing her nose) I don't know.  Don't let on we know he's written.  He'll start in I'm only his housekeeper and that I found out through some chicanery or something. \nSUSAN (Soothing her) How did you find out? \nMARTHA Like any housekeeper --  I read the carbon paper. (She hands the mail to Susan) Bring him the mail. \nSusan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window.  After a moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls. He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMITTED \nFULL SHOT - EXT. INN - (DAY) \nThe bus comes to a stop and our principals get out, Phil staying with the driver for the luggage.  The others enter the inn. \nMED. SHOT - INT. INN \nMartha at the desk, and her eyes widen in surprise. \nBETTY We're the Stewart sisters. \nJUDY Your floor show. \nMARTHA (To Waverly) Don't worry -- I've already told them we'd have to cancel. \nWAVERLY Why?  We have a floor, haven't we? \nMARTHA Last time I looked.  But who are they going to sing to? \nWAVERLY Even if it's only to you and me, it will be well worth it.  Besides, there will be six inches of snow tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow. \nBETTY (Happily) Is that the weather forecast? \nWAVERLY No.  But if there was one thing I learned in the army it was to be positive -- especially when you don't know what you're talking about. You'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P. \nPhil and Bob stiffen automatically. \nPHIL AND BOB Yes, sir! \nWAVERLY (To Betty and Judy) And you two charming ladies, I want you to know I'm looking forward to your show this evening.  Whatever your audience lacks in numbers, it will make up for in enthusiasm -- (He glares at Martha) or I'll know the reason why! \nHe smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified. \nJUDY (Utterly charmed) Gee... no wonder we won the war! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM INN - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT - \nBETTY AND JUDY \nThey are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil are sitting at one table. \nMartha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and helping out at table. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nThey are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob to look in this direction.  Bob does. \nREVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT \nThe General is seating a table. \nMED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nBob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition.  They look at each other. \nBOB I think well stay a little longer than we planned. \nMED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nThey finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, but the few people in the audience don't make for much clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest and clearest. \nMED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY \nHe is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys. \nMartha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless. \nWAVERLY Excellent.  I enjoyed it very much. \nBOB Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming? \nPHIL (Getting off the desk) No, no.  Let's go through the gesture. If you had been on the Titanic when it went down, you wouldn't've been satisfied just to sink into the ocean. (Gesturing) You'd have done a swan dive into it. With me on your back! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY) \nThe scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged - the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness of the previous scene. \nTHE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity. \nMARTHA I can't believe it!  You mean you brought the whole show up here? \nBOB When you hired the Stewart sisters you also hired a New York show.  It was in the small print. \nPHIL And you can't get out of it.  We've got lawyers. \nSUSAN I can't thank you enough, but I wonder if Gramp'll let you do it? \nPHIL Why not? \nMARTHA His pride.  When he decides he's going into bankruptcy he likes to go. \nBOB Now just a second.  We're not doing this for him! \nPHIL Oh no!  We're bringing the show down here to rehearse! \nBOB The company's been getting a little ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of the hall. \nPHIL Of course we don't expect it free! \nBOB We'll pay a little, but not much. - You see, the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us, that's quite an improvement. \nThis has not fooled Susan.  She throws her arms around Bob and then Phil. \nSUSAN I don't know what to say! \nShe cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out.  There is a moment of silence. \nBOB I hope this is not an indication of advancing age, getting kissed out of gratitude. \nPHIL You didn't expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to? \nBOB A body keeps hoping. \nBetty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack. \nBob is quite surprised. \nBETTY (Sincerely) That was the nicest thing I ever saw anybody do. \nBOB It was still gratitude. \nPHIL (To Judy) I'm his partner.  I'm entitled to half the credit. (Judy steps up to him and just pecks him on the cheek, then joins her sister in rehearsal) She's not as grateful as her sister. \nThey look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy. \nHe steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing by. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPeople break off what they were doing and begin to drift out. Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy. \nBOB Get a little rest before tonight's performance. \nPHIL (To Judy) I'll walk you over. \nBOB Phil! (He takes a sheet of music out of his inside pocket) Look this over, I want to try something. \nPHIL (To Judy) See you later. \nThe girls go.  Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations. \nFULL SHOT - ROOM \nBob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of the room as an audience of one.  Phil looks up from the piano, puzzled. The sunset is visible through the window and there is a mood of quiet. \nMARTHA Guinea pig? \nBOB (Nodding) That's the idea. Want you to hear a song I just wrote. \nMARTHA If it's a love song, don't get too close. \nBOB It isn't.  Just tell me how you think the Old Man would feel about this one. \nHe leaves her and goes to the piano and they do WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A GENERAL, solely for Martha. \nToward the end of the song -- \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY \nUnseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to the song. \nMED. SHOT - INT. ROOM \nThe boys finish the number. Martha applauds and Bob bows. \nMARTHA (Very moved) I think it's just wonderful -- \nCLOSE SHOT - SUSAN - AT KITCHEN DOOR \nShe is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron. \nSUSAN I think so, too. \nCLOSE SHOT - WAVERLY - AT THE DOOR \nWAVERLY I'm afraid I disagree. The song is funny, but there is one thing wrong with it. \nPHIL'S VOICE What's that, sir? \nWAVERLY It's true.  I'd rather you didn't. \nFULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR \nBob and Phil exchange a quick glance. \nBOB AND PHIL Yes, sir. \nThe General turns and exits toward the lobby, THE CAMERA PANS with him, a lonely figure walking through the lobby, the CAMERA STOPPING on a poster advertising tonight's performance. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJUDY The way Phil dances, and he's funny. It's easy to see yourself married to him. \nBETTY (An effort) And Bob? \nJUDY He's different, deeper, and he's funny, too.  It'd be nice to be married to both of them. \nBETTY Good thing they're not a quartette. \nJUDY (Oblivious) If I was Catherine the Great, that's what I'd do.  Phil in the daytime, Bob at night. Or should it be the other way around? \nCLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY \nSHOOTING PAST Betty.  Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion of a tear? \nJUDY Phil'd be more fun in a night club, but eventually a girl wants a pipe and slipper fellow.  That's Bob, smoking a pipe and petting a cocker spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in to suit you is something every girl should go through.  I hear it's half the fun.  Which one do you like better?  Betty? (No answer.) Betty? (Softer) Are you asleep? (No answer. Judy turns over and closes her eyes) \nMusic has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake. \nShe is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter. This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of bed and puts on her robe. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. INN KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) \nWe PAN Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens. \nBOB'S VOICE Tuna fish, on the lower shelf. \nBetty whirls around. \nMED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB \nWe see Bob is having a snack of his own. \nBETTY Oh! \nBOB What are you doing?  Sleep-walking? \nBETTY I couldn't sleep. \nBOB Little young for that, aren't you? \nHe gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape him. \nBOB What shall I make you? \nBETTY Anything'll do. \nBOB If you tell me what you want to dream about I'll know what to make you. \nBETTY (Amused) How's that? \nBOB Different foods make for different dreams.  I've got a whole theory about it.  It's called \"The Wallace Way of Wishful Wooing.\"  You'll find it in the American Medical Journal under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese, for instance, you get a cool, thin, blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich - (He shakes his head) you get both girls at once.  Bad night. \nBETTY What do you dream on tuna? \nBOB Darndest thing, I dream about me. \nBETTY (Evenly) Then I'll have a tuna sandwich. \nBob doesn't get the significance of what she has said. \nBob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy. \nBOB You're kidding! \nSYLVIA We don't want anyone else to know. \nALBERT Please don't mention it. (The orchestra starts to play ROCKABYE BABY.  Sylvia and Albert are startled) For heaven's sake! \nSYLVIA How did they know? \nThe girls start crowding around. \nGIRLS (Ad libbing) You wouldn't tell us, would you?  We had to find out ourselves, etc. (Phil and Judy are among the group) \nMARTHA (Formally) There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show! (Everyone approves) \nMED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT \nPhil puts his arm around Albert. \nPHIL Obviously you're going to call the boy after me! \nBOB After you?  I hired Sylvia!  The baby'll be named after me! \nPHIL I've been dancing with her!  That's more important!  The baby'll be named after me! \nBOB The hiring was more important!  After me! \nPHIL The dancing was more important! After me! \nALBERT I'm her husband. (Small pause) The baby'll be named after me. \nBOB Well, we're going to need another dancer! \nPHIL How about Judy, she knows all the routines, she could pick it up in no time. \nThey walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group now includes Betty. \nBOB On the other hand, it's all right if we lose a number, we're running too long now.  We have to cut somewhere. \nBETTY Wouldn't it be better if you cut my solo number?  I've never felt right in it anyway. (Indicating Phil) The show needs every bit of his dancing. \nBOB (Interpreting this as mere selflessness for love) Well - \nBETTY There you are - painless. \nShe turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks is her devotion. \nMED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \nBob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty. He looks at Phil and shakes his head. \nBOB Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number.  Old Chinese saying. \nPHIL (All this is beyond him) What are you talking about? \nBOB Drink your coffee. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT) \nREVERSE ANGLE \nTHE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight. Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the General in the buggy noticing this. \nMED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE \nBob is in the foreground, the General in the background. Bob joins the General at the buggy.  From Waverly's expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action. \nWAVERLY Must be interesting to be a woman. \nBOB The idea's never occurred to me, sir. \nWAVERLY Well, think about it. (Bob is thinking about it) Well? \nBOB Not interested! \nWAVERLY A man like you must be an expert on women. \nBOB It's a little immodest to say so, but I consider myself an authority on the fair sex,  I've made a study of the subject.  They're simple creatures. \nWAVERLY They couldn't fool you? \nBOB I'm single. \nWAVERLY 'Pride goeth before a fall.' \nBOB 'Who knows his own strength is twice armed.' \nWAVERLY It's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field.  Tell me, why do you think Betty went to New York? \nBOB (Not willing to admit it) She has a job in The Carousel. \nWAVERLY Expert, you're wrong!  She went to New York because she's so in love with someone here she just couldn't stand it. \nBOB Phil. (A mixture of resentment and frustration) I'm darned if I can figure out why. \nWAVERLY I thought you were an expert on women. (To the horse) Come on, Delilah! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY \nTHE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve. \nEverybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil and Judy rehearse.  The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's part, but it is lover's coolness. \nPHIL (Fitting the action) Good, Judy. (During the dancing) Now the same as the middle part. \nThey make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, dancing as one. \nREVERSE ANGLE - BOB \nHe enters the room, and watches.  He looks intently at Phil. Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue dancing, talking as they do. \nPHIL Betty get off all right? \nBOB (Slightly belligerent) Certainly. \nJUDY Betty left something for you.  She said to give it to you after she left.  It's on the piano. \nBob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil.  Phil becomes conscious of the staring. \nWAVERLY (Without looking up) They're cumulus clouds, at an elevation of seven thousand feet. \nBOB Yes, sir. (Still trying) Still, weather's a funny thing. It could snow - overnight. \nWAVERLY (He thinks a moment) I'll tell you something I haven't told my family.  I'm going back in the Army. \nBOB Really, sir? That's great news! \nWAVERLY Yes.  I miss the Army. \nBOB Where are you going to be sent, sir? \nWAVERLY Well, I'm not sure yet.  I've always been a combat officer, but I got an idea they're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me.  They'd better not.  They just better not. (He's worked up now) I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet. (He smiles) Now nothing to the women folk about this! \nBOB No, sir. \nWAVERLY Let's mosey over to the post office, I'm expecting a letter any day. \nBOB (Remembering) Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. (He pulls the letter out of his pocket) That's what I came over to give you, it slipped my mind. \nThe General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back. \nWAVERLY (Solemn) This is the one. (He opens it,  He squints.  He looks to Bob) My glasses are in my room.  I'd like to read it by myself, but I'm a little anxious. (He smiles at his own predicament) Read it, son.  Slowly. \nBOB (Reading) Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old - (He stops) \nWAVERLY (Pleased) Skip that word. \nBOB Yes, sir. (Continuing) It certainly was a surprise hearing from you.  Your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine. Of course you've got plenty of time to be amusing, sitting on that porch, rocking away, while we put in a full day's work.  You always were a lucky stiff, and I envy you.  A few years more, I was saying to Emmy the other evening, and I'm going to be able to take it easy like old Tom. \nWAVERLY (Just repeats) Old Tom. \nBOB Oh, well, some people have all the luck.  Everyone in the family is fine here.  Carol had the mumps, which is no joke at eleven years of age - \nWAVERLY The rest of the letter is about the family. (Bob looks at him, and then glances at the rest to see if it is so) He's telling me they have nothing for me, we're not fooling each other. (He holds has hand out) Thank you. (Bob gives him his letter.  There is a pause.  An attempt at being light) Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes.  Now could it? \nBOB (Trapped, unhappy for him) No sir. (His nerve up) Begging your pardon, sir, there's a lot to be said for leisure.  You're not used to it, you've always been active, but in time - \nHe stops, seeing Waverly's expression.  Waverly winks at him. \nWAVERLY (Quietly) Never kid a kidder.  Go on back to the hotel. \nBOB Yes sir. \nWaverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all. Bob watches this reflectively as we \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nMED. SHOT - (DAY) - INT. HOTEL ROOM - BOB AND PHIL \nBob is packing his valise, Phil helping him. \nPHIL Judy thinks my eyes are soulful.  Do you think my eyes are soulful? \nBOB One of them is. \nPHIL You have no poetry in you.  It's about time you went in for girls, too.  After all, you haven't many years left for that sort of thing. \nBob, his back turned to Phil, comes across the sock Betty knitted for him; he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has bag. \nLEADER What? \nBETTY Play \"Blue Skies\" -- anything. \nLEADER Relax.  Just do it the way you sang it this afternoon -- you'll be great. \nHe gives the downbeat, and Betty has no choice but to sing LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  She is assisted in the second chorus by a vocal group. \nCLUB - MED. SHOT \nas Bob watches her.  When she finishes the number, Betty steps down from the platform and joins Bob. \nBETTY (As Bob holds the chair) Well, surprise.  What brought you to the big city?  And don't say 'a train.' (Forced gaiety, hiding her tension) \nBOB I never heard you sing that well. That's a good number for you. \nBETTY (Her own significance) Some numbers suit you better than others.  What are you doing here? \nBOB Business, business.  Meeting a fellow here. \nBETTY Judy all right? \nBOB She's fine.  Couldn't be better. (Carefully) Playing footsie with Phil. \nBETTY That's nice. \nBOB I think they like each other. \nBETTY I do, too. \nBOB (Eyeing her) They're kind of suited, in a lot of ways. \nBETTY Some people are. \nBOB Thanks for the knitted sock. \nBETTY Don't mention it. \nBOB I thought it was for Phil. \nBETTY (Evenly) If the sock fits, wear it. \nBOB (Unsure of her meaning) It started out for Phil. \nBETTY It just started out as a sock. \nEvery line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of the love implications. \nBOB You're a very odd girl. \nBETTY You're a very odd fellow. \nBob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of his ground. \nBOB Two feet, one sock.  I must be. \nBETTY I'll get around to the other one, eventually. \nBOB You mean to do any knitting in the near future? \nBETTY The feeling comes and goes. \nPHIL Bob, just leave it to me!  He won't get near a set if I have to break a leg... Goodbye, Bob! \nHe opens the door of the booth and hurries across the lobby toward Susan, who is at the desk, and BANGS on the bell, which is on the counter.  Martha comes running from the kitchen. \nPHIL (Excitedly) Now everybody pay close attention. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. TELEVISION STATION - (NIGHT) \nEd is about to go on the air.  Bob is opposite him, out of camera range,  The technical crew are watching the hand of the dial approaching 60. \nED I hope Phil has been able to keep the old man away from a television set. \nBOB He has.  In anything involving something crooked he's dependable. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. LOBBY COLUMBIA INN \nSeated around the television set are Waverly, Martha and Susan.  Martha and Susan look at their watches and each other, nervously.  Waverly also looks at his watch. \nWAVERLY Ed Harrison will be on in a half minute.  I like him.  I never miss him. \nThe women are becoming very nervous.  Suddenly we HEAR off scene the most tremendous clatter dorm the stairway and Phil's shouting. \nPHIL Ow!  Ow!  Ow! \nWAVERLY (Jumping up) What's that? \nHe runs toward the stairs.  Martha and Susan breathe a sigh of relief and follow Waverly. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - STAIRS \nWaverly runs to the tangled Phil. \nPHIL My leg is broken!  Ow, ow! \nWAVERLY Take it easy, boy. (He starts feeling his leg) \nPHIL Ow! Ow! It's broken! \nWAVERLY No it isn't!  You may have a bad sprain, but no bones are busted! \nPHIL It's broken, sir.  I can feel it. \nWAVERLY Let me help you. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - INT.

It's broken in two or three places! \nWAVERLY That's just the impression you have! I tell you it's only shock! \nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM into the office as they lay him out on the couch. \nSUSAN Just fine. \nBETTY They are bedded down in all the hotels. \nMartha blows her nose. \nMARTHA His old outfit... If I wasn't such a mean old biddy, I'd probably break right down and cry. (She cries) \nBOB There's nothing to cry about, is there? \nHe looks to Susan and she begins to bawl. \nSUSAN (Through the crying) Thank you so much. \nBob looks to Betty for support. \nBOB Can't you do something? \nBETTY They're just affected by the gesture. \nShe can't hold it back either, and now the three women are crying. \nBOB That's fine. \nBETTY (Through her tears) Where are Judy and Phil? \nBOB Probably in their rooms, crying. \nThey start out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED. SHOT - EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nAs Bob and Betty turn around the corner, they see Phil and Judy, locked in an embrace.  Bob has been in front, but he steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers. \nBETTY Who is it?  General Waverly? \nBOB The lovers. \nBETTY (To Bob) We can't just stand here.  We have to get some sleep. \nShe walks into sight, Bob following.  Phil and Judy break, embarrassed. \nJUDY We were rehearsing for the show tomorrow night. \nBETTY Is it going to be that kind of a show?  We'll be raided! \nJUDY What are you doing here?  What happened at The Carousel? \nBETTY I'm helping out here tomorrow. \nPHIL Hi, Bob. Everything's under control. (Fluster) I mean with the show. We've got a lot of new material.  You both are going to have to do a lot of rehearsing. (Flustered again) I mean the other kind of rehearsing - I mean - rehearsing  Well, good night, Judy. \nAnd he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still flustered. \nJUDY Good night, Phil.  Good night, Bob. \nBETTY (To both) Good night. \nFlustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow, thinking it is their own. \nMARTHA Very well.  I'll explain to Bob and Phil that you didn't care to come to the show tonight. \nWAVERLY I'll have you court-martialed! \nMARTHA You don't mind being ungrateful, you just don't like being told you are! \nSUSAN (Follows it up) If you think you don't owe them anything, you're not obliged to go. \nMARTHA They haven't done much for you. Hardly anything.  You do what you think is right! \nWAVERLY (Angrily) Martha, I'll make my own decisions! I got along very well in the army without you! \nMARTHA It took 15,000 men to take my place! \nShe stalks out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFULL SHOT - INN FLOOR - (NIGHT) \nIt is slowly filling up.  One of the guiding officials turns out to be the Sheriff we have previously seen. \nPETE (Seating a party) Right this way. \nMED. SHOT - INT. MAKESHIFT DRESSING ROOM - BOB AND PHIL \nThey are getting into their old uniforms, which are slightly misfit. \nBOB (At the trousers) This thing's shrunk. \nPHIL (Looking at the bulge) Pants always shrink in closets. \nBOB I can't breathe in this.  What am I going to do? \nPHIL I know what I'm going to do. (Showing him) I'm going to take one big deep breath, and that's going to be it for the next three hours. \nBob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned. \nMED. SHOT - LOBBY STAIRWAY - (NIGHT) \nGeneral Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure in his uniform and decorations.  Martha and Susan, waiting for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly. \nWAVERLY (Gruffly) Well, I couldn't come down in my bathrobe. \nFULL SHOT - INN FLOOR \nThe spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters the room, and the music starts.  The audience rises and applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table, decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening strains of THE OLD MAN. \nAll eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to their respective tables as the song finishes. \nMED. SHOT - WAVERLY \nHe is profoundly moved and walks to the stage.  The audience is seated.  Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great affection.  The people begin to shout, \"Speech!  Speech!\" Martha and Susan sit. \nThe crowd quiets, waiting for the speech. \nWAVERLY (He must have had a blood transfusion from a sergeant at some time) I am not satisfied with the conduct of this division!  Some of you men are under the impression that having been at Anzio entitles you not to wear neckties!  You are wrong! Neckties will be worn in this area! I have also noticed a deterioration in the quality of saluting!  This is to be improved!  I have also had complaints from the commanding officer of the rest area in Naples!  He informs me that the non-fraternization rule is constantly being broken by men of this division!  In fact, this division is outstanding in its violations of non-fraternization! You all know the rules!  The non- fraternization ban expressly declares you are not to talk to women! (A slightly different tone) Don't talk to them!  That is all! \nThey howl and cheer.  He makes has way toward his own table, greeting old friends on the way. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL \n", "test1_input": "JUDY We're booked in Vermont. \nPHIL Vermont?  What's there? \nBETTY Snow.  We spent last Christmas in South Carolina, the year before in Hawaii.  They didn't seem like Christmases.  There ought to be snow. This one's going to be real white. \nBOB Well, it's the way you've been raised. If you saw a lot of snow when you were a kid you miss it more around Christmas. There's a lot of snow around St. Paul. \nJUDY Is that where you come from - St. Paul? \nIt dawns on him, slowly.  He shows no emotion. \nBOB No.  You come from St. Paul. \nJUDY I come from Canton, Ohio. \nBOB (Just for the record he knows) I'd like to ask you something.  Were you ever in an oxygen tent? \nJUDY Oxygen tent?  Oh no! \nBOB Were you ever in a road company of \"Student Prince?\" \nBETTY No.  Why? \nBob looks at Phil.  The rules are clear between them. \nBob puts his hand out.  Phil takes it.  They shake. \nBOB Very good. \nPHIL Thank you. \nBOB What I admire are the details, the invention, the little lies all around the big one.  It takes talent. \nPHIL Oh, it's nothing. \nBOB Don't say that.  Don't belittle yourself.  Credit where credit is due.  You did it fine. \nBETTY Private conversation? \nBOB Little game we play. \nPHIL (To Judy) May I have this dance? \nJUDY I'd love to. \nPHIL (Helping her up) I'm not going to keep calling you Miss Stewart. \nJUDY The name is Judy. \nPHIL (To Bob) What a pretty name! \nBOB (They're off) Nicer than Dolores! \nBETTY I'm Betty. \nBOB I'm low man.

He won't get any place with her. \nBOB You sure? \nBETTY I'm positive.  I trained her myself. \nBOB She's in the ring with the champ, though.  You've heard of Alcoholics Anonymous? (She nods; he indicates Phil) Women Anonymous.  Their biggest case. \nKeeps falling off the wagon. \nBETTY Well, you keep an eye on him, and I'll keep an eye on her. \nBOB Fine. We can make out the probation report together. \nThe orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song.  (To be decided upon.)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy and Phil, individually.  Toward the end of the vocal Phil dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water.  This blends into their dance.  The staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number.  The audience applauds and they all go back to their booth. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY \nThey are a half dozen steps ahead of the boys. \nJUDY They're both very cute, aren't they? \nBETTY (Hiding her real interest) Both? \nJUDY Uh huh. \nBETTY Which one do you like best? \nJUDY I like them both. \nBETTY You can't have both.  There's a law. \nJUDY Oh, we'll never meet them again, what does it matter? \nThe men are now up to them and help them into the booth. \nMED.

Nimbly, he raises himself in. \nMED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM \nThe Sheriff is in the room.  He looks coolly at the boys, who are now in their own clothes.  He stares at them.  They stare at him.

They'd skin you alive! \nPHIL You ever see any of them? \nSHERIFF Whitey Harris and Jack Ross have a filling station near here! \nBOB Jack Ross!

He couldn't hear anything for two days. \nSHERIFF Danny Beasly!  Too bad he didn't make it. \nBOB Not everybody was lucky. \nPHIL We were lucky in one thing - the old man. \nSHERIFF You can say that again.  Say I'm supposed to arrest a couple of dames! A fellow swore out a warrant! \nPHIL He's a crook!  Burned a hole in a rug and is trying to hold up two kids. \nSHERIFF You don't say! \nBOB (At his watch) We got to get our bags and be at the station in ten minutes!

I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway, Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying to say is, we're engaged. \nHe looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations. \nMED. SHOT - BOB \nHe is flabbergasted. \nMED. SHOT - GROUP \nPhil and Judy are separated by the congratulators. \nBetty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm. \nBETTY I hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world. \nBob sees her emotion through the speech.

CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY \nIn the background we see the General in the butler's pantry getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the corridor from the living room. \n", "test3_true": "BETTY I'm not the least bit worried. (Phil and Judy enter from the kitchen) Frankly, this couldn't come at a better time.  They want me to come back to The Carousel again - I used to sing there before Judy and I teamed up - and I had to turn it down because they can only use a single. (Not too well) So - this couldn't be more convenient. You stay with the show and I'll go back to The Carousel. \nJUDY When did you get this offer? \nBETTY Just today, as a matter of fact.  I got a telegram. \nJUDY Why didn't you mention it before? \nBETTY I didn't want to hurt your feelings. \nJUDY Where is the telegram? \nBETTY I threw it away.  What is this, a third degree?  You don't think I made it up? \nJUDY Yes, I do. \nThere is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each one, speaks. \nWAVERLY Well now, I wouldn't bet any large sum of money on that, since I took the message over the telephone, and I had to deliver the telegram. (To take the tension off) And she didn't tip me, either. \nBetty looks at him gratefully. \nJUDY Oh, Betty! (She throws her arms around her) I'm sorry!  I misunderstood! \nBETTY Now, baby!  It's all right! \nPHIL Well, everything's fine now! \nHappy, he beams at Judy. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY \nSomething bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches him watching Betty. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY \nTrain about to leave.  The General is in the foreground sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him. \nBob and the porter are taking care of her luggage. \nGENERAL (Shouting over noise of train) Where are you going to be? \nBETTY The Carousel. \nThe General looks at her, questioningly. \nBETTY (Whispering, during a lull in the noise) I sent them a telegram this morning. \nThe General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty: \nBETTY Take care of my little sister. \nBOB She can take care of herself.  Worry about the menfolk.  Now don't forget to write. \nBETTY I'll send you picture postcards. \nNot all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience, realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after the train, puzzled. \n"}

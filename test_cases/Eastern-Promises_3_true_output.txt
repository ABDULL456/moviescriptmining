CUT TO 
6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6 
A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse. Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double speed. 
We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks. 
A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table.... 
NURSE 1 Her stats are very poor, very poor. Baby's very distressed. 
Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag. We see a business card from a restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary. 
JUNIOR DOCTOR Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck on the pubic bone. 
Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and speaks softly. 
ANNA Darling... darling, can you hear me? 
NURSE Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty- eight, fifty-eight... fifty-seven... 
JUNIOR DOCTOR Anna, I'm trying to rotate the shoulder medially... shit... 
THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby. 
The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...

NURSE 1 Baby stats sixty-eight and in free fall. 
NURSE 2 I'm not getting a pulse. 
Heartbeats. Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks out of his depth. 
AZIZ Speak to me... 
Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to Aziz. 
ANNA (softly) We need to get the baby out now. 
Aziz knows he can take Anna's word... 
AZIZ OK, let's go. 
All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic. 
TATIANA (V.O.) My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life. 
We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek. 
ANNA (whispers) You had a girl. 
A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist.

AZIZ Ok.   Call it. 
The Junior doctor and a nurse check watches and speak almost in unison... 
JUNIOR DOCTOR Unidentified woman, died December 24th at 11.13. 
NURSE Baby girl, born December 24th at 
7   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. LABOR WARD - MORNING                 7 
Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet. She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift. 
AZIZ Merry Christmas, Anna. 
ANNA Oh, don't be ridiculous.

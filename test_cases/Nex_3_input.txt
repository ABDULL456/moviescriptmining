INT. State police STATION - dAY 
Cavanaugh pours coffee for himself and Ferris. 
CAVANAUGH He's just some gambler. Lives completely off the grid. No bank account. No credit cards. No previous record. 
Ferris So why'd he do it? 
CAVANAUGH Must be a wacko. He'd never met the victim. No connection whatsoever. 
Ferris tries to make sense of it all. 
feRRIS And in fifteen months, why haven't you caught him? 
Cavanaugh sighs woefully. 
CAVANAUGH You saw. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He can see around corners. I even had him in custody once, and he disappeared. 
Ferris Must be very embarrassing. 
A painful subject for Cavanaugh. 
CAVANAUGH And what is it you want him for? 
Ferris Questioning. 
CAVANAUGH About? 
Ferris Stuff that hasn't happened yet. 
Cavanaugh nods knowingly. 
CAVANAUGH Well, I guess Homeland Security trumps liquor store murder. How can I help? 
Ext. Suburban home - las vegas - niGHT 
A tract house, cheap, from the 60's, could be anywhere. Something sad about the place. Cris stands at the door, holding a bag of groceries. IRV, a sick old man, opens the door, wearing a knit cap and pajamas. He's hooked up to a little oxygen tank on wheels. When he sees Cris, his smile crimps the tube in his nose. 
IRV What are you doing back here? 
CRIS I came to fix you dinner. 
IRV Idiot. 
Irv pulls Cris inside. Closes the door. 
INT. irv's house - night 
They embrace like father and son. The oxygen tube gets in the way. 
IRV This is what you get from two packs a day. 
CrIS But you quit ten years ago. 
IRV It was already too late. I just didn't know it. 
CRIS Sometimes not knowing is better. 
Irv shakes his head. 
IRV Look where you're headed, pal. The big decisions are over before you even realize you made `em. 
INT. The finish line - back room - night 
Cavanaugh and Ferris chat with Guy. This time the poker game is in progress. 
CaVANAUGH Any idea where he might be going? 
Guy turns to Ferris. 
GUY I've got a little problem with the IRS. Think I could get some relief? 
FERRIS Depends how helpful you are. 
GuY Oh, I know everything about him. 
He looks at Ferris, knowing. She turns to Cavanaugh. 
FERRIS I need to speak to him alone. 
INT. FINISH LINE - MAIN PARLOR - NIGHT 
Guy and Ferris sip cappucino. 
GUY And another thing, no woman ever turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly because he only propositions the ones he knows'll say yes, which is most of `em anyway. But does that make him happy? No. Says he's bored. Never surprised. Has to watch himself die over and over again. 
FERRIS Why'd he come back to Vegas? 
GUY Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying. An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs. - He's an orphan, ya know. Been on the road since he was ten. 
INT. Irv's house / living room - night 
The place is a mess. Piles of newspapers. Old clothes. Cris cleans up as they talk. Irv sits at a table and plays solitaire. 
IRV You want my advice? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in. 
CRIS If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me? 
IRV Make you a secret agent. 
Cris Don't laugh. They strap me in a chair and make me watch the news. 
IRV Dan Rather or Peter Jennings? 
CRIS It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak. 
Irv is moved by Cris' dilemma. 
Irv There's no way around it?

REVISED October 19, 1995 
A1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY, HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS.  MUSIC OVER. 
1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES) 
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE. It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose. 
2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts... a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION. 
3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over- whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID). 
4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief, a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house... 
5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER-- 
CUT TO: 
6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY) 
TITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed, there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive. 
MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier... it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS... 
7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y 
TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan, free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report. HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE, where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony. 
END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING... 
8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y 
In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now 38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE. 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Van Orton... Yes, it is my birthday, Bob, is that why you called...?  Ah... No, I'm not carrying Alan Baer another inch, fuck him, BG Lumber is history... 
As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q- tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.) 
9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y 
The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic. 
10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger seat, its cellular antenna up. 
SCHUYLER (on carphone) Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know me, of course I'm behind Baer- Grace a hundred per cent... great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month... 
He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion. 
11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 
TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP."  Schuyler is on a cell- phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention. 
SCHUYLER (on cellphone) I've got buyers for the BG paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep... 
As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office. 
MARIA Carol from the museum called. She's sending architect's sketches of the wing... 
12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 
The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay. 
MARIA That Business Week reporter called again-- 
SCHUYLER Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely. 
MARIA (awkwardly) --and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, P.P. Willy. 
SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her. 
MARIA Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was.  He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you had appointments all-- 
SCHUYLER Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon. 
MARIA But you-- 
SCHUYLER Do it.  Did he leave a number? 
MARIA No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight.  At noon. 
Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation... 
SCHUYLER That's all, Maria. 
She heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to look out the window, lost in thought.

CARSON Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ? 
INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT 
REGGIE huddled inside. 
INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON is standing, watching the ceiling. 
CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP 
It is marked C-4. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C- 4. He is about to pull it. 
INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT 
CARSON takes a few more steps forward. 
INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT 
ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling. 
CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP 
The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES to the next trap, marked D-4. 
CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert -- 
MED. SHOT -- ADAM 
He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily. 
Now he slowly reaches for the lever. 
INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT 
CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX 
As REGGIE slowly peers out. 
REGGIE'S P.O.V. 
The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap from this low angle. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE 
As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap now, runs to it, looking down through it. 
MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP 
FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look down at ADAM. 
GRANDPIERRE Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold Gideon, and whoever that is down there. 
ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head. 
ADAM Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He wouldn't dare hit a girl. 
EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT 
As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it. 
INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS) 
REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it. 
REGGIE You didn't have to chase me so hard -- 
ADAM Here, give it to me. 
He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers him the other one. 
REGGIE That one's done -- start on this one. 
He takes the foot and begins rubbing it. 
REGGIE I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are? 
ADAM And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide. 
REGGIE The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps? 
ADAM What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that? 
REGGIE All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps. 
ADAM says nothing. 
REGGIE I said, tell me to go to the -- 
ADAM I heard you, I heard you. 
REGGIE Then say it. 
ADAM Reggie -- listen to me -- 
REGGIE Never mind -- I'll go by myself. 
ADAM What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -- 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- MAIN ENTRANCE -- DAY 
As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform always on guard at the Embassy. 
REGGIE (to ADAM) Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay taxes.  Excuse me, soldier -- 
MARINE Marine, ma'am.

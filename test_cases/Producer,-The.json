THE LITTLE OLD LADY'S FOOTSTEPS.  BEGIN TO FADE. BIALYSTOCK'S FACE QUICKLY RESUMES ITS NORMAL EXPRESSION -- DESPAIR AND DISGUST.

Ahhh ... here we are.  'Hold me, touch me.'\" \nCAMERA STOPS PANNING AND REMAINS ON ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS.

SHE RAISES HER VEIL, CHUCKLES GLEEFULLY, AND BEGINS TO ASCEND THE STAIRS. \nMEDIUM SHOT.  UPON REACHING THE LANDING, SHE SPOTS THE FIRST LITTLE OLD LADY COMING DOWN.  SHE QUICKLY DROPS HER VEIL. THE FIRST LITTLE OLD LADY DISCREETLY HIDES HER FACE WITH HER PURSE AS THEY PASS EACH OTHER ON THE LANDING. \nDISSOLVE TO FOURTH FLOOR LANDING.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY MAKES HER WAY TO THE TOP.  SHE HANGS ONTO THE BANISTER FOR SUPPORT AS SHE CATCHES HER BREATH.  SHE RAISES HER VEIL, REACHES INTO HER PURSE, TAKES OUT A SMALL FLACON OF PERFUME AND SPRAYS DELICATELY BEHIND BOTH EARS.  THOROUGHLY COMPOSED, SHE APPROACHES BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR.  SHE RAPS ON THE DOOR THREE TIMES IN QUICK SUCCESSION, WAITS A MOMENT, RAPS TWICE AND THEN THREE TIMES AGAIN.  SUDDENLY THE DOOR IS FLUNG OPEN. \nLITTLE OLD LADY LEAPS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND POSES, COYLY. \nLITTLE OLD LADY To the victor go the spoils. \nBIALYSTOCK STARTS FOR HER.  SHE RUSHES AROUND A CHAIR AND DUCKS BEHIND IT.  BIALYSTOCK TIPTOES ON TO CHAIR AND PEEKS OVER IT. \nBIALYSTOCK I'm gonna get you. \nFREEZE-ACTION. \nCREDIT. \nRESUME ACTION. \nCUT TO LITTLE OLD LADY WEDGED BETWEEN DESK AND BACK OF CHAIR.

BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY IN FRONT OF BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR. \nBIALYSTOCK Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench. \nHE SLAPS HER ON THE RUMP. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me. \nCUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS, AGHAST. \nBACK TO MEDIUM SHOT LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday. \nLITTLE OLD LADY And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo. \nBIALYSTOCK Good.  Yes.  Thursday. \nLITTLE OLD LADY And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia. \nCUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS.  IT IS ALL TOO MUCH FOR HIM.  HE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE, AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY.  THE MAN PUTS A FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE.  THERE IS NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM TO LOOK.  HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN. \nBACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever come? \nBIALYSTOCK (to himself) Like clockwork. \nSHE STARTS TO DESCEND. \nLITTLE OLD LADY I shall count the minutes. \nBIALYSTOCK Goodbye, my angel ... My angel! (calling after her) Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia! \nWE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS. \nLITTLE OLD LADY (eagerly) Yes??? \nBIALYSTOCK Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the check.  Can't produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha. \nCUT TO BLOOM.  ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY.  ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES FOR HIM TO BE SILENT. \nCUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY. \nLITTLE OLD LADY (opening her handbag and reaching inside) Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time. \nSHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM. \nLITTLE OLD LADY I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old. \nBIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play. \nBIALYSTOCK Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes. \nSHE STARTS TO DESCEND. \nLITTLE OLD LADY (descending) Ta.  Ta. \nBIALYSTOCK How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts. \nBLOOM But sir, I'm not condem ... \nBIALYSTOCK Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation. (to himself) How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock. \nBIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM. \nBIALYSTOCK You know who I used to be?  Max Bialystock!  The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once.  Lunch at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt! \nHE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR. \nBIALYSTOCK I used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock production. \nHE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES. \nBIALYSTOCK Look at my investors now.  Voila! (gestures at pictures) Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery. \nHE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE.  LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM. \nCUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S DILEMMA. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ... \nCUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK Do the books!  Do the books! \nCUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED. \nBLOOM (sighing) Yes, sir.  Thank you. \nHE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT. \nBIALYSTOCK (to himself) Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there. \nHE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF.  LOOKS AT WINDOW.  NO GOOD. LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF.  GRIMACES.  FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES IT AGAINST THE WINDOW.  HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE.  HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING.  BLOOM IS WATCHING.  THEIR EYES MEET.  BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT. BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW DOWN INTO THE STREET. \nCAMERA:  SHOT OF STREET.  BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW.  A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK (voice over as camera follows Rolls) Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it. \nBLOOM (off screen) Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ... \nBIALYSTOCK I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people? \nBLOOM IS WOUNDED. \nBIALYSTOCK I have hurt your feelings. \nBLOOM NODS. \nBIALYSTOCK Good, what is it? \nBLOOM Sir, may I speak to you for a minute? \nDURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT ACROSS HIS CHEEK. \nBLOOM Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. \nBIALYSTOCK (faintly) Help! \nBLOOM All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it. \nBIALYSTOCK Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you. \nBLOOM Oh, it's all right ... wha? \nBIALYSTOCK Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it. \nBLOOM (pouring over the accounts) Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped. \nBIALYSTOCK Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap. (crossing to couch) Wake me if there's a fire. \nHE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH. \nCAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. \nBLOOM Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ... \nCAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES.  HE COMES TO THE END AND IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW. \nBACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.  HE COMPARES PAGES. \nBLOOM (musing to himself) Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's absolutely amazing.  But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. \nQUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE.  HIS EYES POP OPEN. \nCUT BACK TO BLOOM. \nBLOOM Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM. HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS.  HE MOVES TO BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION.  BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD. \nBIALYSTOCK Yes??? \nBLOOM LOOKS UP.  HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO CLOSE TO HIS OWN. \nBLOOM (at a loss) Yes, what? \nBIALYSTOCK What you were saying.  Keep talking. \nBLOOM What was I saying? \nBIALYSTOCK You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. \nBLOOM (smiling) Yes, it's quite possible. \nBIALYSTOCK You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit? \nBLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES BIALYSTOCK.  HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A STUDENT. \nBLOOM It's simply a matter of creative accounting.  Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man. \nBIALYSTOCK Assume away! \nBLOOM Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need. \nBLOOM (his eyes widened in terror) You're going to jump on me. \nBIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY. \nBLOOM You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea. \nBIALYSTOCK (nonplussed) What??? \nBLOOM (by now he is shrieking) Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me. \nBIALYSTOCK (shouting and jumping up and down next to Bloom) I'm not going to jump on you! \nBLOOM (rolling away in terror) Aaaaaaaaaa! \nBIALYSTOCK (hoisting Bloom to his feet) Will you get a hold on yourself. \nBLOOM (up on his feet and running for cover) Don't touch me!  Don't touch me! \nHE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.  TRAPPED!  HE TURNS. \nBIALYSTOCK What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you? \nBLOOM I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical. \nBIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK.  PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE. \nBLOOM I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical and I'm wet! \nBIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS, SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. \nBLOOM (holding his face) I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm still hysterical! \nBIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN. \nBLOOM No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't help.  It only increases my sense of danger. \nBIALYSTOCK What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical. \nBLOOM Go away from me.  You frighten me. (he indicates the sofa) Sit over there. \nBIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA. \nBIALYSTOCK (exasperated) Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better? \nBLOOM It's a little better, but you still look angry. \nBIALYSTOCK How's this? (he smiles sweetly) \nBLOOM Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal. \nBIALYSTOCK (for want of something sensible) Well, you know what they say, \"Smile and the world smiles with you.\"  Heh, heh. (to himself) The man should be in a straight jacket. (to Bloom) Feeling better? \nBLOOM Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know. \nBIALYSTOCK They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch. \nBLOOM That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ... \nBIALYSTOCK (interrupting) Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little. \nBLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY. \nBLOOM (brightening) You found a flop! \nBIALYSTOCK A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty! \nHE BENDS DOWN, PICKS UP THE SCRIPT AND SHAKES IT IN BLOOM'S FACE. \nBIALYSTOCK This is freedom from want forever. This is a house in the country. This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley. This is wine, women and song and women. \nBLOOM SNATCHES THE SCRIPT FROM HIS HANDS AND READS ALOUD THE TITLE. \nCUT TO CLOSE-UP.  TITLE OF SCRIPT. \nBLOOM (voice over) \"SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp with Adolph and Eva in Berchtesgarten.\"  Fantastic! \nBACK TO TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. \nBIALYSTOCK It's practically a love letter to Hitler! \nBLOOM (ecstatic) It won't run a week! \nBIALYSTOCK Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act. \nBLOOM Who wrote it? \nCUT TO AUTHOR'S NAME ON THE MANUSCRIPT:  By FRANZ LIEBKIND. \nDISSOLVE THROUGH AUTHOR'S NAME TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, SHAVED AND DAPPER, WALKING DOWN STREET IN A RUN-DOWN TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD. \nBLOOM Here it is -- 415. \nTHEY MARCH UP STOOP TO NUMBER 415.  THEIR MOTION IS ARRESTED BY A QUERULOUS COMMAND ISSUED IN PHLEGMATIC TONES BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BUILDING (A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES) WHO IS LEANING OUT OF HER WINDOW WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE STOOP. \nSUPER Who do you want? \nBLOOM (taken aback) I beg your pardon? \nSUPER Who do you want?  No one gets in the building unless I know who they want ... I'm the concierge.  My husband used to be the concierge. He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge. \nBIALYSTOCK (imperiously) We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind. \nSUPER Oh, the kraut.  He's on the top floor.  Apartment twenty-three. \nBLOOM Thank you. \nTHEY START INTO THE BUILDING. \nSUPER But you won't find him there.  He's up on the roof with his birds.  He keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting, filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You used to be able to sit out on the stoop like a person.  Not anymore. No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift? \nBLOOM We ... uh ... get your drift. Thank you, Madam. \nSUPER I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE BUILDING. \nCUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FORTIES.  HE IS WEARING, AS ALWAYS, A GERMAN HELMET.  HE CROUCHES BESIDE A HUGE PIGEON COOP.  IN HIS LEFT HAND HE TENDERLY HOLDS A PIGEON.  IN HIS RIGHT, A SMALL PHOTO OF ADOLPH HITLER.  HE SHOWS THE PICTURE TO THE BIRD.  HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL HE IS SURE THE BIRD IS FOCUSED ON IT PROPERLY. \nLIEBKIND (to pigeon) Hilda, look ... look good ... Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda, if he lives, I know you will find him. \nHE KISSES THE BIRD AND TOSSES IT SKYWARD. \nCUT TO ROOF DOOR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER ONTO THE ROOF. THEY LOOK FOR LIEBKIND.  HE IS NOT ON THAT SIDE OF ROOF. THEY WALK AROUND TO OTHER SIDE.  AS SOON AS THEY TURN THE CORNER, THEY SPOT LIEBKIND CROUCHED NEAR THE COOP. \nBLOOM (whisper) Sigmund Freud. (he downs drink) \nCUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK (whisper) Max Bialystock. (he downs drink) \nBACK TO SCENE. \nLIEBKIND I vas vit him a great deal, you know. \nBIALYSTOCK With whom? \nLIEBKIND (astonished by the question) Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime. \nBIALYSTOCK No kidding? \nLIEBKIND Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer. \nBIALYSTOCK Really, I never dreamed ... \nLIEBKIND (flies into an indignant rage) That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie! (he gestures V for victory) Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill! \nBIALYSTOCK (swinging along) That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. (MORE) \nBIALYSTOCK (CONT'D) (to Bloom) Leo, quick, the contract. \nBLOOM QUICKLY WHIPS THE CONTRACT OUT OF HIS POCKET, PRODUCES A PEN, HANDS THEM TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK SPREADS THE CONTRACT OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE LIEBKIND. \nBIALYSTOCK Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind. And make your dream a reality. \nHE HANDS LIEBKIND THE PEN.  LIEBKIND REFUSES IT. \nLIEBKIND Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived? \nBIALYSTOCK We swear it! \nLIEBKIND Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath? \nBIALYSTOCK Yes.  We would! \nINSERT:  CLOSE-UP BLOOM.  HE LOOKS WORRIED. \nLIEBKIND Good.  I will make the preparations. \nLIEBKIND LEAVES THE ROOM. \nBLOOM (anxious whisper) Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army. \nBIALYSTOCK Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag. \nLIEBKIND ENTERS.  HE IS LADEN DOWN WITH ALL SORTS OF RITUALISTIC PARAPHERNALIA.  LIEBKIND PLACES ALL THE STUFF ON THE TABLE.  WITHOUT A WORD TO THEM, HE GOES TO PHONOGRAPH. \nIN A FEW SECONDS WE HEAR THE OPENING STRAINS OF WAGNER'S \"RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES.\"  AS THE MUSIC BOOMS LOUDER, LIEBKIND ADDRESSES THEM. \nLIEBKIND Please to don your helmets. \nFROM THE TABLE THEY TAKE CLASSIC WAGNERIAN HELMETS (WITH HORNS) AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR HEADS. \nLIEBKIND Please to light your candles. \nTHEY EACH TAKE A HUGE WHITE CANDLE FROM THE TABLE AND LIGHT IT.  LIEBKIND FLICKS THE LIGHT SWITCH.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE DARK EXCEPT FOR THE GLOW OF THEIR CANDLES. \nBLOOM Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is. \nBIALYSTOCK (placating him) Okay, take it off, take it off. \nTHEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER BASKET.  BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI.  HE WHISTLES.  IT STOPS. \nBIALYSTOCK (to cab driver as he opens door) The Blue Gypsy. \nBLOOM (about to enter cab with Bialystock) Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?! \nBIALYSTOCK (stopping Bloom from entering cab) We are not going to The Blue Gypsy. I am going to The Blue Gypsy. \nBIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR.  HE CONTINUES SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW. \nBIALYSTOCK I have a rendez-vous with a lady of some means.  You see dear Bloom, phase one is complete, the play is ours.  We are now entering phase two -- the raising of the money. In the days to come, you will see very little of me, for Bialystock is launching himself into little- old-lady-land. (to cab driver) Avanti! \nTHE CAB SPEEDS AWAY. \nSWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3.  IN HER HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.  SHE RAISES IT TO BIALYSTOCK. \nPULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY. THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE. \nLITTLE OLD LADY #3 Here's to the success of your new play. \nBIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS. \nBIALYSTOCK Our play, my love. \nHE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST. IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS VEST AND TROUSERS. \nLITTLE OLD LADY #3 Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you? \nBIALYSTOCK Think nothing of it, my dear.  A mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did you bring your checkbook? \nLITTLE OLD LADY #3 It's right here in my purse and I made it out just as you told me -- to cash.  That's a funny name for a play. \nBIALYSTOCK Think nothing of it. \nSHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED. BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART.  BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY.  HE QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST. \nCUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S FOOT.  BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT. \nCUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE.  SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.  WITH EYES CROSSED BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE.  BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK. \nSWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH CENTRAL PARK.  NIGHT. \nCUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB.  BIALYSTOCK IS COZILY ENSCONCED WITH LITTLE OLD LADY #4. \nBIALYSTOCK (taking check from old lady) Thank you, my dear. \nLITTLE OLD LADY #4 Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again. Tell me again. \nBIALYSTOCK Edna, I swear on my life, you don't look a day over sixty-five. \nSWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC.  DAY.  A TAXI FILLS THE SCREEN.  AS IT MOVES OUT OF FRAME, WE DISCOVER BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY #5 ASTRIDE A RED AND WHITE HONDA MOTOR SCOOTER.  AS THEY ROAR PAST THE CAMERA, BIALYSTOCK SHOUTS. \nBIALYSTOCK Clear the road!  Clear the road! \nLITTLE OLD LADY #5 (clutching Bialystock fiercely) Go, Bialy, baby, go! \nBIALYSTOCK (Bloom's thought makes him unhappy) OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money. \nLEO, HUMORING HIM, SPINS THE COMBINATION DIAL ON SAFE AND OPENS IT. \nCUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE.  IT IS JAMMED FULL OF NEATLY STACKED PILES OF MONEY. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE. \nBIALYSTOCK (to himself.  Inhales deeply) That's better. \nBIALYSTOCK TAKES OUT A STACK OF NEATLY FOLDED BILLS.  HE SMELLS IT, KISSES IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET. \nBLOOM What are you doing? \nBIALYSTOCK I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy. \nBLOOM (quizzically) A toy? \nDISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA. DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER.  SHE IS INCREDIBLY WELL-ENDOWED. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM. \nBLOOM That's a toy? \nBIALYSTOCK Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty. \nBLOOM STARES AT HIM. \nBIALYSTOCK Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings. \nQUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC. \nBIALYSTOCK Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom. \nULLA Got dag pa dig. \nBLOOM How do you do. (to Bialystock) Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say? \nBIALYSTOCK They'll say, \"Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh.\" \nBLOOM What is she gonna do here? \nBIALYSTOCK I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work. \nULLA Ya, sur. \nULLA GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD.  THE DRIVING SOUND OF A TWIST FILLS THE ROOM.  ULLA SENSUOUSLY TWISTS, VIBRATES, FRUGS, WATUSIS AND ROCKS HER BODY IN TIME WITH MUSIC. \nBIALYSTOCK See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla, okay.  Okay. \nULLA STOPS, GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND TAKES NEEDLE OFF. \nBIALYSTOCK Go to desk.  Answer telephone. \nHE PICKS UP PHONE TO SHOW HER. \nBIALYSTOCK Bialystock and Bloom.

Bialystock and Blum. \nBIALYSTOCK (to Bloom, opening up a box on his desk) Hey, Blum, have a cigar. \nBLOOM What do you mean? \nTHE DOOR OPENS.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS A THIN, STRANGE LOOKING MAN IN A BLACK TURTLENECK SWEATER.  (CARMEN GIYA) HE CONTEMPLATES THEM COLDLY. \nCARMEN Yesssssss? \nBIALYSTOCK I am Max Bialystock.  This is my associate, Mr. Bloom.  We have an appointment with Mr. De Bris. \nCARMEN Ah, yes, you're expected.  Please come in. \nTHEY ENTER THE VESTIBULE.  CARMEN CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM. \nCARMEN How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr. De Bris' private secretary.  Would you be so kind as to remove your shoes. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER BEWILDERED. \nCARMEN White, white, white is the color of our carpets. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM REMOVE THEIR SHOES. \nCARMEN (to Bloom indicating a rack of slippers) Now, let's see, you're wearing grey. I would suggest the crimson. They're a little vivid, but your suit is so quiet. (to Bialystock, studying his mish mash attire) Why don't you... Oh, take anything. Please follow me. \nCARMEN LEADS THE WAY.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM. WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN VARIOUS POSES. \nINT: ELEVATOR. \nCUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM.  IT IS ELEGANTLY FEMININE. \nCHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT. \nDE BRIS (from behind screen) I'll never get into this damned thing. \nCUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER. \nCARMEN (to De Bris) We're not alone. \nDE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME, NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES. \nDE BRIS Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the pun. \nBLOOM (to Bialystock) What pun? \nBIALYSTOCK (a curt whisper) Shut up.  He thinks he's witty. (to De Bris) It's good to see you again, Roger. Did you get a chance to read \"Springtime For Hitler?\" \nDE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A \"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN\" STYLE DRESS. \nDE BRIS Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning piece of work. \nBLOOM (shocked, whispers) Max!  He's wearing a dress. (his mouth remains open) \nBIALYSTOCK Shhhhhh. \nDE BRIS (continuing) I think it's a very important play. I, for one, never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean it's drenched with historical goodies like that. \nDE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.) \nDE BRIS Oh, dear, you're staring at my dress.  I should explain.  I'm going to the Choreographer's Ball tonight.  There's a prize for the best costume. \nCARMEN (smugly) We always win. \nDE BRIS (looking in the mirror) I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm supposed to be the Grand Duchess -- I think I look more like Tugboat Annie.  What do you think? \nCUT TO BEAUTIFUL, BLOND, MUSCULAR, YOUNG MAN, WHO LOOKS AS IF HE IS POSING FOR \"BODY BEAUTIFUL.\" HE BEARS NOT THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO HITLER EVEN THOUGH HE DOES SPORT A LITTLE BLACK MUSTACHE. \nCUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. \nBIALYSTOCK Not bad.  Not bad.  What do you think, Franz? \nLIEBKIND (very emotional) I don't know.  I don't know.  For some strange reason, I'm deeply moved. (he wipes away a tear) \nDE BRIS (getting to his feet) Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.  We must have some order. \nDE BRIS, FOLLOWED BY CARMEN, HOPS TO THE STAGE AND ADDRESSES THE MILLING MOB. \nDE BRIS (clapping his hands for attention) Will all the dancing Hitlers please wait in the wings.  We're only taking the singing Hitlers. \nAS THE DANCING HITLERS LEAVE THE STAGE, CARMEN ARRANGES THE SINGING HITLERS SO THAT THEY ARE IN A LONG STRAIGHT LINE AGAINST THE BACK OF THE STAGE WALL.  CARMEN READS OUT A NAME AND THE FIRST SINGING HITLER WALKS DOWNSTAGE TO AUDITION. EXCEPT FOR A SPORTY LITTLE HITLER MUSTACHE, HE BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FUHRER. \nCARMEN Arthur Packard. \nDE BRIS Hello, Arthur.  Tell us something about yourself. \nARTHUR PACKARD (in a strangulated tenor's voice) I was the lead tenor of the Albuquerque Opera Company for two seasons.  I just finished a road tour of STUDENT PRINCE.  And last season I was up for the lead in the Broadway production of Circus Man. \nDE BRIS What happened? \nARTHUR PACKARD I didn't get it. \nDE BRIS What are you going to sing for us Arthur? \nAS ARTHUR TELLS HIM THE TITLE OF HIS SONG, DE BRIS MOUTHS IT WORD FOR WORD TOWARD HIS FRIEND, CARMEN. \nARTHUR PACKARD The soliloquy from CAROUSEL. \nFROM THE PIT THE PIANO PLAYS A FOUR BAR INTRODUCTION. \nARTHUR PACKARD (sings) My boy Bill will be strong and as tall as a... \nDE BRIS Thank you. \nARTHUR SHRUGS AND LEAVES THE STAGE. \nDE BRIS Next please. \nCARMEN Jason Green. \nJASON GREEN COMES DOWNSTAGE.  HE IS A BIG, BARREL-CHESTED MAN.  HE ALSO WEARS HITLER-TYPE MUSTACHE. \nDE BRIS Well, Jason, what have you been doing lately? \nJASON GREEN (in basso profundo) For the last sixteen years, I've been touring with \"Naughty Marietta.\" \nDE BRIS Good.  And what are you going to sing for us, Jason? \nAS JASON TELLS HIM THE SONG'S TITLE, DE BRIS ONCE AGAIN MOUTHS IT WORD FOR WORD WITH HIM. \nJASON GREEN \"Stout-hearted Men.\" \nBEGINNING OF \"STOUT-HEARTED MEN\" MONTAGE. \nTHERE IS A SHORT PIANO INTRODUCTION. \nJASON GREEN (singing) \"Give me some men Who are stout-hearted men Who will fight for the right they adore.\" \nCUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC. THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION. \nSTORM TROOPER CHORUS (singing) Germany was having trouble, What a sad, sad story. Needed a new leader To restore its former glory. Where, oh, where was he, Who could that man be, We looked around, And then we found, The man for you and me, And now its... \nTHE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM, DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH BALLOON IS PAINTED A PICTURE OF THE FUHRER.  EVERYONE SINGS AS THEY DESCEND. \nENTIRE CHORUS (singing) \"Springtime for Hitler,\" etc. \nCUT TO AUDIENCE.

THEY ARE SMILING.  BIALYSTOCK POINTS TO COUPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR SEATS AND STARTED UP THE AISLE. \nBIALYSTOCK Ahhhhh, it's going better than I expected. \nTHE COUPLE COMES ABREAST OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. \nWOMAN (to man as they exit theatre) Well, talk about bad taste. \nBIALYSTOCK (he chuckles as they leave) Come, let us repair to the bar across the street.  I don't want to be caught here during intermission. We'll be stoned to death. \nTHEY LINK ARMS AND MERRILY MARCH OUT OF THE THEATRE. \nCUT TO STAGE.  \"SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER\" OPENING IS ENDING IN A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY. \nENTIRE CHORUS (singing) So Springtime for Hitler, Is Springtime for Goering, Is Springtime for Goebbels, Is Springtime for Himmler, Is Springtime for you and me!! \nCURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT. \nCURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD). EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE. IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT. \nEVA Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht. Er liebt mir.

You know that. \nEVA If you lieb me, why are you leaving me? \nLSD Hey, man, I can't spend all my time with you.  I took an oath, baby, Deutschland uber alles. \nCUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.

How'd we come out? \nGOEBBELS We won. \nLSD Groovy! \nTHEY SMACK HANDS. \nLAUGH FROM AUDIENCE. \nCUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC. \nLIEBKIND Bring down the curtain!  Bring down the curtain! \nHE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES THE CURTAIN ROPE. \nCUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE. \nLSD Goebbels, you're the only one... \nTHE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE. \nLIEBKIND I am the author of this play.  You are the victims of a hoax.  These are not my words.  The Fuhrer never said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was good. \nSTAGE MANAGER (off camera) Get that curtain up. \nCURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND HOLDS IT DOWN. \nLIEBKIND NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up! \nDESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP. \nLIEBKIND Stop!  Stop! \nAS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE, THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE. \nCUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP HIS NOTES. \nCUT BACK TO LIEBKIND. \nLIEBKIND We have been betrayed!  I will return!  I will returnnnnn... \nLIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES. \nDISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY. ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER. MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND. IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE. THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS. \nULLA We make love? \nBIALYSTOCK No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work. \nULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM. \nHE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS READING. \nBIALYSTOCK Double.  Double.  Double. \nWITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF BLOOM'S HANDS. \nBIALYSTOCK (clutching the books triumphantly) Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa! \nBLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID, SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER. \nBLOOM (shrieking) FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT! \nBIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT. BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND TURN TOWARD THE DOOR. \nCUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE. \nLIEBKIND (off screen, outside door) I am betrayed! \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER. \nCUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND. \nLIEBKIND (solemnly) You have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die. \nHE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK. \nLIEBKIND This is no good.  I'm not killing you.  Don't you understand, you have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!! \nCUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED BEHIND DESK.

THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, DUMBFOUNDED. \nLIEBKIND Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars. \nULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR. \nULLA Three coffees.  Two regular.  One black... two sugars. \nSHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM. \nBIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF DESPAIR. \nLIEBKIND And now ve must resume hostilities. Are you coming out from behind that desk or not? \nCUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING APPROVAL. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN. \nCAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND. BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES LOOSE.

THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE. \nLIEBKIND Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse? \nBLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR. \nBLOOM There it is. \nCAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND TUNNEL. \nBACK TO SCENE. \nLIEBKIND (to Bloom) Pick it up and bring it here, please. \nBLOOM Okay. \nHE STARTS TOWARD SECOND TUNNEL. \nLIEBKIND (anxiously) Where are you going vit the light? \nBLOOM I need it.

BLOOM SETS DETONATOR DOWN. \nLIEBKIND Und now for the final connection. \nHE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND RAISES THE PLUNGER. \nBIALYSTOCK Wait.  I'll check to see if the coast is clear. \nHE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS BACK. \nBIALYSTOCK The coast is clear! \nLIEBKIND Good.  Get down. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS. LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS. \nLIEBKIND Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye, my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my tortured testament of twisted truths. \nBIALYSTOCK Do it!  Do it! \nLIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS. \nLIEBKIND I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child. \nHE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN. HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY. \nBIALYSTOCK (quizzically) Nothing. \nLIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES DETONATOR. \nLIEBKIND Here is gut... of course, of course.

Let's face it, we'll never find it. (he turns to face Bialystock) Max, tomorrow's another day. Today's another day. \nBIALYSTOCK (off-camera.  Crazy little voice) We'll never find it, eh?  We'll never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE IS STANDING.  AT HIS FEET LIES A SCRIPT.  HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS CHEST. \nBIALYSTOCK (as he does an insane little jig around the script) You can't smell it when it's under your nose.  You can't see it when it's right before your eyes. (MORE) \nBIALYSTOCK (CONT'D) You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket. \nCUT TO MEDIUM SHOT. \nBLOOM Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening? \nBIALYSTOCK I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all. \n", "test1_id": 2496, "test2_input": "DE BRIS I mean in show business. \nLSD Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut. \nDE BRIS What do you do best? \nLSD Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for. \nDE BRIS Oh, sing.  Sing! \nLSD Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up? \nDE BRIS (a little hysterical) Sing a song!  Just sing a song! \nLSD Here's a little thing I think you're going to see on the charts any day.  I wrote it last night in my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk Rock Ballad. \nLSD SINGS \"I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT.\" THE SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT \"RAGA ROCK\" BEAT.  PHRASES SUCH AS, \"CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE\" AND \"TURN ON THE WORLD.\" LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER. \nCUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS.  THEY ARE STUNNED.  BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER. \nBIALYSTOCK (shouting) That's our Hitler! \nLIEBKIND (howls of despair) Vaaaat??? \nBIALYSTOCK (quickly) Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time. \nLIEBKIND But he has long hair! \nBIALYSTOCK Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory. \nLIEBKIND I don't know.  I don't know. \nDE BRIS (he has been studying LSD intensely) Could be an exciting piece of off- beat casting.  Of course, we'd have to do something about that coiffure. \nLIEBKIND But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy, he's so... so... American! \nBIALYSTOCK Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down. \nLIEBKIND All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you. \nDISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.

LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB, DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE LITTLE OLD LADIES. \nCUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS. BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT \"SUPPORTERS\" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS, BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE. \nFIRST WELL-WISHER (a silver-haired gentleman in his late fifties) Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big hit. \nBIALYSTOCK (mumbling) Bite your tongue. \nSECOND WELL-WISHER (a little old lady) We're gonna do it this time, Bialy, I just know it. \nBIALYSTOCK I hope you lose your bloomers. \nTHIRD WELL-WISHER (another old lady) My prayers go with you, Bialy. \nBIALYSTOCK God Forbid. \nCUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.

Tomorrow, the world! \nHE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE. \nOFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL) Check your hat? \nLIEBKIND (off camera) No!! \nBIALYSTOCK So much for Nutsy Fagin. \nBLOOM (nudging Bialystock, whispers) Here comes the Times Drama Critic. \nBIALYSTOCK Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin. \nBIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE. \nBIALYSTOCK Always delighted to see the gentlemen of the press.  There you are, sir.  Two on the aisle, compliments of the management. (he smiles unctuously) \nDRAMA CRITIC (haughtily accepting tickets) Thank you.  Here, wait a minute. There seems to be some mistake. There's a hundred dollar bill wrapped around these tickets. \nBIALYSTOCK (conspiratorially) It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show. \nDRAMA CRITIC (outraged) Mr. Bialystock, just what do you think you're doing? \nBIALYSTOCK I'm bribing you.  And if you play ball, there's a lot more where that came from. \nBIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF. \nDRAMA CRITIC (blustering with rage) I... I... I... How dare he!  I've never been so insulted in my life! The gall of the man!  The incredible gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon. \nTHE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK, HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR. \nOFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL) Check your hat? \nDRAMA CRITIC (off camera) No!! \nBIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL, STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET. \nBIALYSTOCK (grinning like a Cheshire cat) Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us. \nFROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING. LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK. \nBLOOM Come on, they've started the overture. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE. \nCUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK. \nBLOOM (casually shrieking) Well, Max, this is it!!! \nHE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH. \nBLOOM (whispers) I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. \nBIALYSTOCK Relax, in two hours our worries will be over. \n", "test2_id": 2497, "test3_input": "BIALYSTOCK \"I want to croon, \nBLOOM AND DRUNK \"He wants to croon, he wants to croon, \nBIALYSTOCK \"To my honey I'll croon, \nBLOOM AND DRUNK \"He's gonna croon love's tune, \nBIALYSTOCK \"Honeymoon, \nBLOOM AND DRUNK \"Honeymoon, honeymoon, \nBIALYSTOCK \"Keep a shining in... \nBIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.

A HORDE OF FIRST NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS. \nCROWD (ad-lib) \"Scotch on the rocks,\" \"Bourbon and soda.\" \"Two martinis.\" \"Whiskey sour.\" \nTHE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM THE FIRST ACT. \nWOMAN (to her escort) Well, so far that's about the funniest thing I've ever seen on Broadway. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER. \nWOMAN'S ESCORT Never laughed so much in my life. \nMAN (to his friend) Hysterical, absolutely hysterical. \nMAN'S FRIEND I thought I'd split my sides. \nBIALYSTOCK Take it easy, don't panic.  There are a lot of plays on this street. They are not necessarily talking about \"Springtime For Hitler.\" \nHUSBAND (to his wife) Honey, I never in a million years thought I'd ever love a show called \"Springtime For Hitler.\" \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER UMBRELLA. \nLITTLE OLD LADY #8 Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it. It's a smasheroo. \nBIALYSTOCK (in a daze) Smasheroo.  Smasheroo. \nTHE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE. \nLITTLE OLD LADY Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it. \nTHE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.

UNHAPPY WITH THEIR PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING. \nDRUNK (singing) \"By the light... By the light, by the light...

No way out. \nBIALYSTOCK Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true. \nBLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM. \nBLOOM (droning monotonously) No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who? \nBIALYSTOCK Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience.

THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER. \nCUT TO STAGE.  HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR. THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF. \nGENERAL (making a report) We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating. \nLSD No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack! \nGENERAL Who can we attack?  They're all too big. \nLSD (getting an inspiration) Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland! \nGENERAL We can't... we keep our money there! \nCUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

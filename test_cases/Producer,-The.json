Maybe we'll get lucky tomorrow. \nBIALYSTOCK You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one... \nLIEBKIND It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler. \nFROM OFF-STAGE WE HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF BOOTS APPROACHING. ALL EYES TURN TOWARD THE STAGE.  FROM OUT OF THE WINGS STEPS \nA YOUNG PERSON IN A LEATHER DOUBLET, HIGH LEATHER BOOTS, AND EXTREMELY LONG HAIR.  IT CARRIES A GUITAR.  UNTIL IT SPEAKS, WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN. (LORENZO ST. DU BOIS) \nLSD Hey, man. \nCARMEN I beg your pardon. \nLSD Is this where they're auditioning Boomerang? \nCARMEN (studying him coldly) No, I'm afraid you've wandered into the wrong theatre. \nLSD (to himself, as he starts to leave) Man, freaked out again. \nBIALYSTOCK (leaping to his feet) Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang. \nDE BRIS (to Bialystock) What are you saying? \nBIALYSTOCK Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose? (to LSD) What's your name? \nLSD Lorenzo Saint DuBois.

Sing! \nLSD Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up? \nDE BRIS (a little hysterical) Sing a song!  Just sing a song! \nLSD Here's a little thing I think you're going to see on the charts any day.  I wrote it last night in my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk Rock Ballad. \nLSD SINGS \"I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT.\" THE SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT \"RAGA ROCK\" BEAT.

BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER. \nBIALYSTOCK (shouting) That's our Hitler! \nLIEBKIND (howls of despair) Vaaaat??? \nBIALYSTOCK (quickly) Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time. \nLIEBKIND But he has long hair! \nBIALYSTOCK Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory. \nLIEBKIND I don't know.  I don't know. \nDE BRIS (he has been studying LSD intensely) Could be an exciting piece of off- beat casting.  Of course, we'd have to do something about that coiffure. \nLIEBKIND But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy, he's so... so... American! \nBIALYSTOCK Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down. \nLIEBKIND All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you. \nDISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.

THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS. BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT \"SUPPORTERS\" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS, BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE. \nFIRST WELL-WISHER (a silver-haired gentleman in his late fifties) Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big hit. \nBIALYSTOCK (mumbling) Bite your tongue. \nSECOND WELL-WISHER (a little old lady) We're gonna do it this time, Bialy, I just know it. \nBIALYSTOCK I hope you lose your bloomers. \nTHIRD WELL-WISHER (another old lady) My prayers go with you, Bialy. \nBIALYSTOCK God Forbid. \nCUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.

There you are, sir.  Two on the aisle, compliments of the management. (he smiles unctuously) \nDRAMA CRITIC (haughtily accepting tickets) Thank you.  Here, wait a minute. There seems to be some mistake. There's a hundred dollar bill wrapped around these tickets. \nBIALYSTOCK (conspiratorially) It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show. \nDRAMA CRITIC (outraged) Mr. Bialystock, just what do you think you're doing? \nBIALYSTOCK I'm bribing you.  And if you play ball, there's a lot more where that came from. \nBIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF. \nDRAMA CRITIC (blustering with rage) I... I... I... How dare he!  I've never been so insulted in my life! The gall of the man!  The incredible gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon. \nTHE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.

LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK. \nBLOOM Come on, they've started the overture. \nBIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE. \nCUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK. \nBLOOM (casually shrieking) Well, Max, this is it!!! \nHE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH. \nBLOOM (whispers) I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. \nBIALYSTOCK Relax, in two hours our worries will be over. \n", "test2_id": 2497, "test3_input": "GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING. \nGOEBBELS Heil, baby!

HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE. \nLIEBKIND I am the author of this play.  You are the victims of a hoax.  These are not my words.  The Fuhrer never said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was good. \nSTAGE MANAGER (off camera) Get that curtain up. \nCURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND HOLDS IT DOWN. \nLIEBKIND NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up! \nDESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP. \nLIEBKIND Stop!  Stop! \nAS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.

I will returnnnnn... \nLIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES. \nDISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY. ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER. MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND. IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE. THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS. \nULLA We make love? \nBIALYSTOCK No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work. \nULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM. \nHE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.

He's crazy!  He's going to kill me.  Call the police! Call the police!  Help, help, murder, murder, rape, rape!!! \nBIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK. \nBIALYSTOCK (moaning) How could this happen?  I was so careful.  I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?  We forgot one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler always drew a crowd. \nBIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK. \nBIALYSTOCK What are you doing? \nCUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR. \nBLOOM (defensively) Don't try to stop me.  I've made up my mind. \nBIALYSTOCK What are you doing with those books? Where are you going? \nBLOOM (with hysterical conviction) I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long. \nHE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH. HE BLOCKS THE DOOR. \nBIALYSTOCK (reasonably) Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're overwrought.  You don't know what you're doing.  You're acting out of panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS! \nBIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH. \nBLOOM I never should have listened to you. \nBIALYSTOCK I never should have listened to you. \nBLOOM Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you. \n", "test3_id": 2498}

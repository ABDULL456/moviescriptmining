CLOSE ON: GANDALF...lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. He wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing...rising onto his knees...lifting his head... Gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of Orthanc. He is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. Another whispering wail rends the air. Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the ORCS. Gandalf looks on in Horror as ORCS hack into the trunk with axes. 
ANGLE ON: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SARUMAN stands in Rain looking out into the dark night...the ORC overseer sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating with exertion. 
ORC OVERSEER The trees are strong, my Lord.   Their roots go deep. 
SARUMAN Rip them all down. 
CAMERA CIRCLES SUMMIT: MORE AND MORE TREES are hauled down and killed...as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WEATHERHILLS -- DAY 
Wide on: The rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on, lead by Strider. Strider stops before a distant hill, topped by an Ancient Ruin. 
SARUMAN This was once the great Watchtower of Amon Sul. We shall rest here tonight. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEATHERTOP HOLLOW -- DUSK 
ANGLE ON: 
FRODO, MERRY, AND PIPPIN collapse into a small hollow, halfway up Weathertop...they are muddy and exhausted. Stider drops 4 small swords at the Hobbits feet. 
SARUMAN There are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEATHERTOP HOLLOW -- NIGHT 
Close on: Frodo...eyes flickering open. He suddenly sits up, sniffing the air. Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddled over a small fire... Sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan. 
FRODO What are you doing? 
MERRY Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. 
FRODO Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire! 
PIPPIN Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes! 
A SUDDEN SHREIK! 
ANGLE ON: 
FIVE RINGWRAITHS ON FOOT, running up the steep slope unnaturally fast. 
FRODO Go! ! 
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin clamber desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEATHERTOP SUMMIT -- NIGHT 
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an ancient tower. The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre of the Ring, waiting for the first assault... One by one, the 5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their leader...the WITCH KING! 
SAM Back, you devils! 
Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist, sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head... 
Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He disappears. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM (CONT'D) No! 
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: 
ANGLE ON: 
Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE: Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger... 
IN THE REAL WORLD: 
...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

DR. SEVARD Your T-cell count is down to nine, a healthy person has five hundred to fifteen hundred. 
RON What the fuck's a three-Cell?! 
DR. SEVARD T-cell.   Frankly we're surprised you're alive. 
RON Well surprise this: you've made a fuckin' mistake! 
Ron looks back and forth from Dr. Saks to Sevard.    No mistake. 
RON You must've mixed my blood with some daisy puller or sumptin. 
EVE We ran the blood test several times. 
Eve hands him some pamphlets and other paper work. 
EVE That's some information on HIV and AIDS you may find informative and your test results. 
Ron flips through the papers. Becomes frustrated by terminology he doesn't understand. 
DR. SEVARD Mr. Woodroof, we're trying to impress upon you the gravity of your situation. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 11 
DR. SEVARD (CONT'D) Based on your condition, we estimate that you have about thirty days to get your affairs in order -- 
RON Thirty days? 
Ron jumps off the examining table. 
RON What is this shit?! 
They don't respond. 
Ron laughs incredulously and walks towards the door. 
RON I got a news flash for all y'all, there ain't nothin' out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in thirty days. 
Ron looks at the papers, tosses them up in the air and exits. 
14   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       14 
Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron. 
15   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       15 
T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated. 
As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a CALENDAR. 
But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30. Ron snaps out of his hallucination. 
16   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       16 
T.J. sits down next to Ron, takes a rolled up dollar bill and does a line of coke. 
T.J. Damn doctors cut your balls off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 12 
RON Shit, you tell `em you got a cold and they'll give you two weeks off. You should try it. 
Ron takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour himself a drink. 
T.J. Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work. I'd take disability any day. 
Ron does a line of coke.   Sees his reflection in the mirror. Pushes it away. 
RON I mean I got a stupid cough and they tell me I got some HIV virus. 
T.J. looks at Ron, hears him but doesn't hear him, maybe it doesn't even register he's so wasted. 
RON (mutters) Hell, like I got the AIDS. Damn hospital, mixed up my blood samples. 
T.J. Man, I went to them doctors once, they tell me I had chlamydia, I came back home I realized I had crabs.

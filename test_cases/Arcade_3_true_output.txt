THE GUARDS 
are after him now, CHARGING down the hallway. 
UP AHEAD, 
A set of double doors labeled "EMERGENCY EXIT" blocks his way. 
Nick spins out, sweeping the back of the board forward and SCREAMS to a stop just before the doors.  He kicks the board up into his free hand and... 
WHAM!  He hits the doors running.  Now the FIRE ALARM is blaring in addition to the other alarm.  A VOICE is squawking over the P.A. and it's a hell of a racket. 
VOICE (on P.A.) SECURITY BREACH IN R&D.  SUBJECT HEADING TOWARDS EASTERN EXIT... 
INT. STAIRWELL -- DAY 
Nick is charging down the stairs four and a time...  One level, two... Now he's reached ground floor... 
INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 
BOOM!  Nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of GUARDS heading straight for him. 
Nick drops his board to the ground and heads right, pumping his foot... 
One of the GUARDS leaps at him and... 
...misses by a foot or so, CRASHING to the tile floor. 
NICK 
SCREECHES to another stop, TWISTS, and starts pumping down another hallway... 
INT. LOADING AREA -- DAY 
Nick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of boxes and lumbering forklifts.  A few WORKERS attempt to stop him, but he's moving too fast. 
AHEAD, 
is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis. Nick's heading for it.  The loading door is open, and outside is freedom. 
JUST THEN, 
the steel loading door begins to GRIND and lower.  Some genius has hit the controls. 
NICK 
pumps like mad, and he's really moving now.  Either he'll make it, or he's going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour... 
THE DOOR 
is quickly closing off Nick's escape route.  He's only got about four feet to negotiate... 
Nick ducks low and clears it! 
EXT. LOADING DOCK -- DAY 
Nick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the concrete driveway.  The driveway peels off to the left and slopes downward. 
Nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed. 
BELOW, 
the driveway splits off.  To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and to the right, the parking lot. 
GUARDS 
are piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nick off.  It's going to be close... 
Nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him. 
It's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to the end of the driveway... 
WHOOSH!  Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in order to slow his speed... 
He leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab in the back seat of the Skylark. 
ALEX 
guns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY 
Nick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.  The sun is beginning its descent and the sky is taking on a reddish tint.

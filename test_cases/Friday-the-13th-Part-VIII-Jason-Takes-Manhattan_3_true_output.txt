MILES' POINT OF VIEW 
Jason is right at his heels. 
MILES 
slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM OFF THE MAST. 
STUNT FREEFALL 
Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives... 
CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE 
...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal. 
EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS 
coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on: 
MILES (EFX) 
...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE. 
JULIUS 
doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING... 
EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK) 
...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly swallowed by the torrential waters. 
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER ...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing: 
YOUNG JASON (O.S.) Hhhhelp....me.... 
Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at: 
YOUNG JASON (EFX) 
...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his hands reaching out to her. But then comes the inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her room, choking on murky water. 
YOUNG JASON Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning... 
RENNIE 
stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a deep lake, and extends her arms to him. 
YOUNG JASON 
grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide. 
RENNIE 
feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her eyes expanding because she's now looking at: 
HERSELF! 
Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE. 
YOUNG RENNIE Hhhhelp....me.... 
RENNIE 
screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room. 
YOUNG RENNIE 
disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG. 
NEW ANGLE 
as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her. 
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND 
groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering across her table like a spider. 
TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON 
Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the circular shattered window. She's slowly dying. 
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND 
Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She seizes it, getting a firm grip. 
CLOSE ON JASON 
as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason instantly releases her, reeling backwards. 
RENNIE 
sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across the room to her stateroom door just as:

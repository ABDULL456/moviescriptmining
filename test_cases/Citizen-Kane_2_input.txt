THOMPSON You know why?  She was so - 
BERNSTEIN Sure, sure. 
THOMPSON I'm going back there. 
BERNSTEIN Who else did you see? 
THOMPSON Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his - 
BERNSTEIN Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met - 
THOMPSON He made an awful lot of money. 
BERNSTEIN It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. (his eyes get reflective) Thatcher! 
Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks. 
BERNSTEIN He never knew there was anything in the world but money.  That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! (reflectively) The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money...  Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business! 
DISSOLVE OUT: 
DISSOLVE IN: 
INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY - 
Bernstein speaking to Thompson. 
BERNSTEIN He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane did, and he got it!  Thatcher never did figure him out.  He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me. Mr. Kane was a genius like he said. He had that funny sense of humor. Sometimes even I didn't get the joke.  Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... (indicates with a little wave of his hand what he thinks of that; sighing) That was years later, of course - 1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible.  But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man in those days.  But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland - 
He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - 
It is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant. 
CITY EDITOR (turns to a young hireling; quietly) What about Branford Leland?  Has he got in his copy? 
HIRELING Not yet. 
BERNSTEIN Go in and ask him to hurry. 
CITY EDITOR Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland. 
BERNSTEIN (looks at him for a moment; then slowly) I might make him nervous. 
CITY EDITOR (after a pause) You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand. 
BERNSTEIN (with a smile) That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers." 
Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter. The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation. 
CITY EDITOR He's a great guy - Leland. (another little pause) Why'd he ever leave New York? 
BERNSTEIN (he isn't saying) That's a long story. 
ANOTHER HIRELING (a tactless one) Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between - 
BERNSTEIN (quickly) I had nothing to do with it. (then, somberly) It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly.  Better we should forget such things - (turning to City Editor) Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle? 
CITY EDITOR Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course. 
BERNSTEIN And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in? 
CITY EDITOR Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review. 
BERNSTEIN Enthusiastic? 
CITY EDITOR Yes, very! (quietly) Naturally. 
BERNSTEIN Well, well - isn't that nice? 
KANE'S VOICE Mr. Bernstein - 
Bernstein turns. 
Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout. He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded opera hat. 
BERNSTEIN Hello, Mr. Kane. 
The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, half-suppressed sensation. 
CITY EDITOR Mr. Kane, this is a surprise! 
KANE We've got a nice plant here. 
Everybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say. 
KANE Was the show covered by every department? 
CITY EDITOR Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures. 
KANE (very, very casually) And the notice?

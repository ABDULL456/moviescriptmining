Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY 
The five men stride through the automated terminal doors and towards a waiting limousine. 
Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, exits and hails a cab. 
INT. CAB 
RATH Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them? 
CABBY Sure. 
Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as the cab pulls away. 
INT. LIMOUSINE 
The five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to RING. 
The older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase, removing a cellular phone. 
AKIRA Hello? 
We hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses English. 
ELECTRA (V.O.) I trust your flight was comfortable? 
AKIRA Your Japanese is excellent. 
ELECTRA (V.O.) Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone. 
ELECTRA I'll call you again in twenty minutes. 
She punches a button and shoves the antennae down. 
The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct. 
The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct. 
Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations. She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on- line. 
On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in. 
INT. CAB 
Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding traffic, the limo still in sight. 
Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded newspaper where he had hid the contract file. 
He flips past several documents before finding what he's looking for; the cat. 
He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches Electra rush about. 
Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks it out. 
ELECTRA Excuse me, your Highness. 
Nikita casually walks off the bed. 
Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct-tape. 
EXT. HYATT HOTEL 
The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway. 
The cab pulls in behind it. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone. 
INT. HYATT LOBBY 
The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and uncomfortable. 
The BRIEFCASE RINGS. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
Electra is pacing again. 
ELECTRA Room 1414. 
INT. HYATT LOBBY 
With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an elevator.  The doors close. 
Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a familiar sound.

{"train": "BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK \nWritten by \nDon McGuire and Millard Kaufman \nBased on the story \n\"Bad Day At Hondo\" \nby Howard Breslin \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN BEFORE MAIN TITLE \nBAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK \nESTABLISHING SHOT - BLACK ROCK - PART OF TOWN: FOCAL POINT: RAILROAD STATION \nabandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation. The structure is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped. Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation. Between the building and the tracks is a long, somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, termites and the elements. The match-board overhang of the building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform, sags and bellies. From the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is identified: \nBLACK ROCK \nOne of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other, cocking the sign irregularly. \nThe railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. Past the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each other toward infinity. The morning sun lays over this wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky. \nA small shack stands next to the station, separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, as if for support. The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced across its dusty vitrine. An old straight-backed chair, reinforced with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner of the shack. In it is Mr. Hastings, the postal telegraph agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. He sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose. \nFULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK \nThe town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road. The twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town. In b.g. is the bluff of a black stony mountain. Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's single street*** (See map, P.2A) are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs. \nThe town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the wind. Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held forever in the sullen, abrasive earth. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nSTRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER \njarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its diesel engines pounding. Its horn \"WONKS\" twice, blasting the shatterable air. \nFULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK - ANOTHER ANGLE \nNothing is changed, nothing is altered. But look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street. HOLD for a beat, then MAIN TITLE appears. Between the ensuing credits INTERCUT a series of sharp LONG SHOTS. The composition of each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood. \nEXT. SAM'S SANITARY BAR AND GRILL - ANGLE ON DOC VELIE \nassayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian to its lesser animals. An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar & Grill. Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant. Doc glances casually at his watch; no one else moves. The hot wind continues listlessly down the empty street. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. GARAGE - LIZ BROOKS \nA tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt. She stands just outside the open barn-like door of the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at the endlessly receding tracks. The sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. PORCH OF HOTEL - COLEY TRIMBLE AND HECTOR DAVID \nHASTINGS You for Black Rock? \nMACREEDY (easily) That's right. \nHASTINGS (uneasily) There must be some mistake. I'm Hastings, the telegraph agent. Nobody told me the train was stopping. \nMACREEDY (with a ghost of a grin) They didn't? \nHASTINGS (upset) I just said they didn't, and they ought to. What I -- want to know, why didn't they? \nMACREEDY (shrugging) Probably didn't think it was important. \nHASTINGS Important?! It's the first time the streamliner stopped here in four years. (swallowing nervously) You being met? You visiting folks or something? I mean, whatd'ya want? \nMACREEDY I want to go to Adobe Flat. Any cabs available? \nHASTINGS (as if he hadn't heard right; as if he wanted everyone in town to know) Adobe Flat?! (he gulps, recovers slightly) No cabs. \nMACREEDY Where's the hotel? \nHastings looks at him blankly. The thousand-yard stare of a hypnotic glazes his features. \nMACREEDY (patiently) I asked where's the hotel? \nHastings points. \nMACREEDY Thanks. \nWith his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into Black Rock's single street. For a moment, Hastings stares after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph agent's shack. \nINT. POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE \nas Hastings, fumbling, picks up the phone... \nHASTINGS (into mouthpiece) Hello, Pete? Now, listen... \nREVERSE SHOT - MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK \nSHOOTING down the street as Macreedy slowly walks toward the hotel. Not a person has moved, each eye is glued on the stranger. \nThe hollow rasp of Macreedy's tread on the wooden platform of the \"pavement\" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping silence... \nCLOSE SHOT - LIZ \nas she follows the man's movement. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCLOSE ANGLE - ON MACREEDY \nas he walks along. He feels the eyes of everyone following him, glaring at him. He halts, looks around. The townspeople continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal incuriosity. He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six RFD mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's pistol long ago. \nSHOT - MACREEDY \nheading toward the hotel. In b.g. is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store (which Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. In the yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. It is empty; the front window is thick with dust. On it, etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and crossbones. Running diagonally across is the printed legend: \nT.J. HATES J.S. \nMacreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel. A gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. As it subsides... \nANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY \nAs he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. It has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. Macreedy mounts the hotel steps. At the top of the steps Coley Trimble and Hector David watch him silently. Hector is large and leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship. He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one incongruous accessory which Hector affects. Around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc. \nPETE (uncomfortable) Well... as I said... \nMacreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys. He runs his splayed fingers over the key rack as... \nMACREEDY Lots of vacancies. \nPETE They're everyone of 'em locked up. Some are show rooms... \nMACREEDY Yes...? \nPETE (with touching sincerity) ...for cattle buyers, feed salesmen. The others -- they're spoken for, rented to cowboys, ranch hands... (Macreedy listens respectfully) They pay by the month. For when they come into town. We provide for their every wish and comfort. (weakly) You understand...? \nMACREEDY Not really. But while I'm pondering it, get a room ready. Just for tonight. (picking key from rack at random) This one. \nPete opens his mouth but no sound comes out. [...] at Hector. \nCLOSE SHOT - HECTOR \nglowering at Pete. \nTWO SHOT - MACREEDY AND PETE \nas Macreedy signs the ledger. \nMACREEDY (signing) Sure could use a bath. Where is it? \nHe picks up the key. \nPETE Head of the stairs. \nMacreedy nods, reaches for the bag at his feet. Then he hesitates, looks at Hector. \nMACREEDY I don't know just why you're interested -- but the name's Macreedy. I'm... (grins) It's all in the ledger. \nHECTOR (slowly, his eyes glued to Macreedy's stiff arm) You look like you need a hand. \nMacreedy says nothing. The wales along his face harden. He picks up his bag and climbs the stairs. As he disappears, Hector lumbers to the desk and grabs the ledger. \nHECTOR (reading aloud) John J. Macreedy. From Los Angeles. (looking up) I wanna know everything he does, Pete. Check every call -- any mail. \nPETE (nodding) And in the meantime...? \nHECTOR (grinning harshly) In the meantime, I'll crowd him a little... (looking up the stairs) ...see if he's got any iron in his blood... \nAs Pete bites his lower lip thoughtfully, \nDISSOLVE: \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY - MACREEDY \nin a new bathrobe, before a cracked, discolored mirror. He draws a safety razor down his face, completing his shave; then he wipes a hand over the mirror, which clouds with steam almost as fast as he can clear it. o.s., the SOUND of bath water gurgling down the tub drain. He runs a tentative finger inside the collar of his robe, pulling loose a price tag. He drops it carefully into a wastebasket. He turns on the faucet at the sink to rinse his shaving brush. The rusty pipes cough and rumble, roaring as a trickle of water arrives while the drain sucks loudly at its departure. He dries the razor, turns off the faucet and exits. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - ANGLE ON MACREEDY \nAs he walks down the dark, narrow hall. He wears the bathrobe and slippers; a large towel is draped over his head, like a prize fighter. He stops outside a door, pushes the towel from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob. He is about to insert the key when he tenses. Slowly, silently, he turns the knob and throws open the door. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nNext to the door, in the corner of the small, sparsely furnished room is Macreedy's suitcase, open, its contents askew and scattered over the dusty floor. On the bed sprawls Hector David, his gigantic body straining the springs. He lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick legs crossed, his Stetson tilted over his low forehead. He is completely unconcerned by Macreedy's entrance. For a moment Macreedy stares at him. Then... \nMACREEDY (slightly amused) I think you have the wrong room. \nREVERSE SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE 35X1 \nMacreedy walks down the stairs. Pete looks up from the desk. He is about to dart behind the partition when... \nMACREEDY Hey! Hold it! \nHe walks to the desk, smiling at Pete. In b.g., Doc, Sam and the loafers watch. \nMACREEDY Got any cigarettes? \nPete studies him, then bends under the counter, coming up with a pack. Doc leaves Sam and is slowly walking toward the stranger, eyeing him curiously. \nPETE This is all. \nMacreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack, dexterously using the fingers of his left hand. \nPETE How long you staying? \nMACREEDY In my new room, you mean? (flatly) I'm staying. \nPETE I mean, in the hotel. \nMACREEDY Just about twenty-four hours. (sharply) Why? \nPETE (flustered) I... I was just askin'. \nMACREEDY (evenly) Why? You expecting a convention? \nPETE (doggedly) I was just askin'. \nMacreedy looks at him, inhales deeply on his cigarette then, as he slowly lets the smoke out, removes the cigarette and looks at it. \nMACREEDY Stale. \nNow Doc is at the desk not far from Macreedy. Macreedy starts out, then turns to Pete. \nMACREEDY Where can I rent a car? \nPETE I don't know. \nMacreedy smiles and sighs tiredly. Then... \nMACREEDY (as to a child) Let's put it this way -- if I had a car and if I wanted to put gas in it, where would I go? \nPETE (refusing to cooperate) But you don't have a car. \nDOC (to Macreedy) You might try the garage at the end of the street. \nMacreedy pauses, looking at Doc, who blandly returns his stare. \nMACREEDY Thanks. \nDoc nods. Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, Doc et al watching him. He goes out. \nEXT. STREET \nAs Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up just before him. Tied with a rope to the right front fender is a magnificent eight-point buck. A stain of dry blood weaves an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable bullet hole in his shoulder. Two men get out of the car; one of them is Coley Trimble. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He stands motionless in the center of the narrow pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings out from behind the wheel. He walks around the car, joining Coley at the curb. Macreedy comes on. The man with Coley looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as expressionless as the soil of Black Rock. His handsome face, under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven. Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips. In b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby move out the door and stand on the porch. They watch Macreedy, Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man. Silence soems to settle over everything. It is Macreedy who breaks it... \nMACREEDY (grinning wearily at Coley) Here we go again. \nGently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues down the street. Coley's eyes follow him. Smith goes up the steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. Coley quickly follows him. The loafers on the porch go back inside. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY \nThe loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks briskly to the clerk's desk. Pete, in anticipation, opens the hotel register, places it before Smith \nT.J. She's not here. \nMACREEDY Where'd she go? \nT.J. (shrugging) I dunno. Somewhere. \nMACREEDY When will she be back? \nT.J. I dunno. Sometime. \nAgain the pause. T.J. steps back, having completed his work, which, of course, broadcasts the fact that \"T.J. HATES J.S.\". And again as Macreedy begins to speak... \nT.J. In about ten minutes. \nMACREEDY (with a grin) Thanks. \nT.J. turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes a fastidious \"pony express\" and peddles furiously out of scene. \nEXT. STREET - FULL SHOT \nas Macreedy, after a moment's hesitation, starts down it. From the far end, at the telegraph agent's shack, a figure starts running toward Macreedy. It is Hastings. INTERCUT between the two men. Hastings, in his concentration, doesn't see the stranger until he is almost upon him. He slows down, suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk. Macreedy grins at him, passes on, shaking his head speculatively. Hastings, with a parting glance, gallops up the hotel steps. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - FULL SHOT \nSmith, Coley, Hector, Pete, Doc, Sam et al are still in evidence. Smith is in a tight little group at the desk with Coley, Hector and Pete. Doc has taken a position at the window, looking out. Hastings bursts in and half-runs to Smith... \nANGLE FAVORING SMITH AND HASTINGS \nas the excited telegraph agent speaks. \nHASTINGS I called the Circle T. He ain't got business there -- not if they don't know him. Right, Mr. Smith? \nSmith ignores him, thinking. Hastings breathes heavily. Finally... \nSMITH (to Hastings) Send a wire to Nick Gandi in Los Angeles. Tell him to find out all he can about John J. Macreedy. Tell him I want to know fast. Sign my name. \nHastings nods, scribbling on a pad. \nHASTINGS What was that? \nSMITH Nick Gandi. G-A-N-D-I. Care of the Blake Hotel. \nHastings nods and hurriedly exits. \nCOLEY (after a beat) Who's Gandi? \nSmith looks at Coley, trying to decide if the question in any way challenges his authority. He concludes not... \nSMITH He's a private detective. (beat) I drive to L.A. now and then. \nHECTOR (slightly worried) He'll get us the dope? \nSMITH He'll get us anything, for twenty bucks a day and expenses. (Hector frowns) Hector, you worry too fast and too easy. \nHECTOR It's just, I don't like it. \nCOLEY Maybe he's just passing through. \nHECTOR Don't bet on it. He can only mean trouble. \nSMITH (smiles faintly) Hector, you're jumpy as a stall horse. \nHECTOR (doggedly) We oughtta see him... talk to him. \nSMITH (quietly) About what? (Hector doesn't answer) What'll we talk to him about? The birds, the bees? The weather? The crops? (pauses) You tried -- where'd it get you? \nLIZ It'll be two dollars an hour, gas extra, and ten dollars for my time. \nSMITH (to Liz) Aren't you going to ask him where he wants to go? \nLiz looks from Smith to Macreedy, puzzled. \nSMITH He wants to go to Adobe Flat. \nLiz hesitates. Macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek Smith's for instructions. Quickly he moves in... \nMACREEDY The road's marked? \nLIZ (nodding) Yeah. It's about six -- seven miles down... \nMACREEDY Then I won't need your time. \nMacreedy hands her a bill. She fumbles with it, not knowing what else to do. Her eyes drift to Macreedy's stiff arm... \nLIZ (uneasily) I thought you might... need a little help. \nMACREEDY I can manage. \nHe steps toward the jeep as... \nSMITH Liz. Do you have a license to rent cars? You could get into trouble. \nMACREEDY It's all right. I won't mention it to the Sheriff. \nHe steps into jeep and, with one hand expertly manipulating the controls, drives off. \nMED. SHOT - SMITH AND LIZ \nSmith turns his attention to the girl... \nSMITH (slowly) You shouldn't have done that. \nLIZ I thought it would be better if he went out there and got done with it. (Smith looks at her sharply) I mean, what could he find out? \nFor a moment Smith doesn't answer. Instead, with a half frown, he lifts the bill Macreedy had given her from Liz's hand. \nSMITH (as he studies it) This is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life. \nHe crumples it, pokes the wad in her hand and walks off down the street as... \nQUICK DISSOLVE: \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. JAIL - FULL SHOT - DAY \nTim sits in his chair, still staring sightlessly at the whiskey bottle. Smith enters. He looks from Tim to the bottle on the table, then back to Tim. \nSMITH (after a beat, disinterestedly) What did he want -- the stranger? \nTIM (abstractedly) He asked about Komako. (looking up at Smith) You think he'll kick up a storm? \nSMITH (easily) A storm? About what? \nTIM I don't know. All I know, I don't want trouble around here. (pauses awkwardly, then) Never again. \nSMITH Trouble? You don't know anything about Komako, now do you, Tim? \nTIM I do not. That's the point. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - SMITH, COLEY AND PETE \nIn b.g. at a respectful distance are Hector, Sam and Hastings. SHOOT parallel to tracks, which disappear far into the horizon. \nThe following dialogue is delivered in an undertone... \nSMITH (turning to Coley) Now, Coley...? \nCOLEY (takes a breath, then) I think Macreedy's a nothing. A nobody. \nSMITH Is he? \nCOLEY So there's nothing to worry about. \nSMITH Isn't there? (a beat) You got brains, you have. \nCOLEY (squirming) But what can he find out? That Komako was...? (Smith glares at him) Suppose he finds out? \nSMITH A nobody like Macreedy can raise a pretty big stink. The point is... who would miss a nobody like Macreedy if he just, say, disappeared? Who, Coley? \nColey is terribly preoccupied, balances himself, like a child, on a steel rail. \nSMITH (exasperated) Coley! \nCOLEY (galvanized from the rail) Huh? \nPETE Why don't we wait... \nSMITH Wait for what? \nPETE I mean, maybe he won't find anything. Maybe he'll just go away. \nSMITH Not Macreedy. I know those maimed guys. Their minds get twisted. They put on hair shirts and act like martyrs. They're all of 'em do- gooders, trouble makers, freaks. \nPETE But there's no danger yet. Let's wait and see. \nSMITH (interrupting, appealing to Coley as an equal) No danger, he says. This guy's like a carrier of small pox. Since he arrives, there's been a fever in this town, an infection. And it's spreading. (he glances from Coley to Pete) Hastings has been in a sick sweat, running around, shooting off his face. Doc, for the first time in four years, gets snotty with me. Liz... (to Pete) ...your own sister -- acts like a fool. \nPETE (hotly) She's just a kid. \nSMITH (scoffing) Kid! She must have strained every muscle in her head to get so stupid! Renting him a jeep! And Tim -- Tim, the rum-dum. Tim suddenly decides he's gotta act like a Sheriff. (to Coley, gesturing at Pete) And he says what's the danger. \nBrittle silence for a moment. Then... \nSMITH (easily) Of course, if you want to take the chance... \nPete doesn't answer. \nCOLEY (grimly) Not me. \nSMITH All right, then... \nPETE It's not all right! You're so mighty quick to kill -- he's not an animal! \nSMITH (to Coley, with mock surprise) Well, listen to little spitfire... (turning slowly on Pete) You sniveling toad! I'm saving your neck! If I don't, who will? \nPETE (squirming) All I said... \nSMITH Who will?! Doc? Tim? Your sister, with the rocks in her head? \nPete is silent. \nAn old marker, jutting on an angle at the side of the road, reads: ADOBE FLAT. Beneath it an arrow points ahead. Macreedy steers the jeep up the narrow, rutted trail between a serious of enormous boulders. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas he drives to the far end of the boulders, reaching a flat piece of land completely surrounded by rocks. Beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned-out ranch house, and an abandoned well. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nMED. SHOT - MACREEDY \nin the wreckage. The remains of an iron bed. The burned-out shell of a pick-up truck. Part of a stove. A morass of bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken. Macreedy halts momentarily beside the well. Reaching out he touches the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth. He removes one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we HEAR a faint PLUNK (o.s.). He replaces the board and walks to a broken wall. He touches the burned out frame of a picture. The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square on the surface of the wall. He goes past a solitary standing stone chimney. Suddenly he halts, arrested by something among the rubble, the rottenness and the ashes. \nREVERSE ANGLE - WHAT HE SEES \nSurrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular patch of lovely wild flowers. \nBACK TO MACREEDY \nstudying the brightly colored flowers. His face is lined in thought. He stoops, gathers a few buds in his hand. He examines them, his brow furrowed. As he slowly twirls a flower between thumb and forefinger, CAMERA PANS from Macreedy in a long slow arc, taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland. CAMERA RISES, TILTING UPWARD to a cliff far away and shielded from Macreedy's view by the intervening rocks and ridges. \nEXTREME LONG SHOT - CLIFF \nand on it the outline of an automobile. \nMED. SHOT - THE CAR \nempty. It is parked on a narrow dirt road. On one side of the road the cliff falls abruptly to the valley far below; on the other, the steep, shaly outcropping continues to rise. For a moment CAMERA HOLDS on the car. Then it PANS SLOWLY upward about fifty feet, HOLDING this time on... \nPINNACLE OF CLIFF \nwhere a man is looking off toward Adobe Flat through a pair of high-powered glasses. The man is Coley Trimble. \nADOBE WELLS - MACREEDY \nGrimly he walks toward the jeep, still holding the wild flowers. Now he pockets them, jumps into the vehicle and drives off. \nTHE CLIFF - COLEY \ncontinues to train his glasses on Macreedy far below in the moving jeep. \nTHE JEEP - MACREEDY \ndriving steadily over rough, rocky terrain. \nCOLEY \nclimbs down from the pinnacle of the cliff and enters a big, powerful '36 Packard sedan. \nMACREEDY \nshifts to low gear as the jeep presses into hilly country. \nCOLEY - IN HIS CAR \nturns on the ignition. \nMACREEDY - IN THE JEEP \nas it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side and falling off steeply on the other. He rounds a curve, passes an insignificant side road, drives on. \nTHE SIDE ROAD \nThe car with Coley at the wheel pulls out, follows Macreedy. \nEXT. BLACK ROCK - MAIN STREET CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR \nhis long face even more horsey than usual, with half an apple in his mouth. He stands in front of the grocery store, with the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk. He looks up, stops crunching. \nCLOSE SHOT - SAM \nat the window of the Bar & Grill, cleaning an ear with a toothpick. He looks out. The toothpick is motionless. \nCLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS \nfidgeting outside his shack. He looks up. His Adam's apple turns completely over. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nREVERSE SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE \nMacreedy slowly driving the jeep toward Liz's garage. He looks neither to the right nor left. \nGROUP SHOT - FAVORING SMITH AND COLEY \nStanding on the porch of the hotel, watching. Smith's face compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, contemptuous anger. Coley licks his lips uneasily. Smith turns and enters the hotel. Coley meekly follows. \nFULL SHOT - MACREEDY \nHe brakes the jeep before the garage. No one is there. He parks the vehicle, gets out and heads down the street. \nEXT. HOTEL \nMacreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's car at the curb. Both right fenders are creased. An ugly, jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in the dust of the road. Smith and Coley come out of the hotel. They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn watches the car. They exchange a glance. Smith nods, so... \nCOLEY Well, if it's not Macreedy - the world's champion road hog. \nHe walks down the steps to the street, joining Macreedy. Smith remains on the porch. \nMACREEDY Yeah. It's a small world. \nCOLEY But such an unfriendly one. Now why did you want to crowd me off the road? \nMACREEDY (with a slow grin) I'm kind of sorry if I've incurred your displeasure. \nCOLEY Look what you did to my car. \nMACREEDY If there's anything I can do to make up for it... \nCOLEY You ought to be careful, man -- all that one-arm driving. \nMACREEDY I'd be glad to pay the damages. \nCOLEY It's a threat to life and limb. \nMACREEDY Fortunately no one was hurt. \nCOLEY You could get yourself killed that way -- nosin' all over the countryside. \nMACREEDY That's the real danger, I can see that. \nCOLEY Why that's pretty smart of you. How long you intend to keep it up? \nMACREEDY I'm getting out of here, right now. \nHe walks up the steps, past Smith, and into the hotel. Coley glances up at Smith, grinning with self-satisfaction, like a small boy who has carried out perfectly the instructions of his teacher. \nINT. HOTEL \nMACREEDY It was, just a few hours ago. \nLIZ (flatly) Things change. \nMACREEDY (with grim amusement) Sure. And Smith is the kid who changes 'em. \nShe doesn't answer. Macreedy goes to her. \nMACREEDY Miss Brooks. (softly) What's the matter with this town of yours? \nLIZ Nothing. It's none of your concern. \nMACREEDY Then why are they all so concerned about me? \nLIZ Am I concerned? \nMACREEDY No, you're not. But... \nLIZ But what? \nMACREEDY (easily) But it strikes me you're a little too unconcerned. So unconcerned you won't even rent me a jeep. \nLIZ (flaring) I don't run a taxi service. I don't have a license. \nMACREEDY I wish others in this town were as scrupulously devoted to law and order as you are. \nLIZ (hotly) Why don't you lay off! If you don't like it here, go back where you came from! \nMACREEDY Funny thing. They try to kill me, and you feel persecuted. \nLIZ I don't want to get involved. \nMACREEDY Involved in what? \nLIZ (retreating) Whatever you're up to. Whatever happens, I've got to go on living here. These people are my neighbors, my friends. \nMACREEDY All of them? \nLIZ (slowly) This is my town, Mr. Macreedy, like it or not. Whatever happened here, it was long ago, now it's... it's... \nMACREEDY (evenly) Dead and buried? (a beat) Whatever did happen, you don't seem to like it. Why do you stick around? \nLIZ (after a beat) Because of my brother. Pete. He'd never leave. \nMACREEDY Didn't you ever think of going without him. You're sort of independent and he's... he's... \nLIZ Weak. I know. That's why I couldn't leave him. \nMACREEDY (softly) What did your brother do? \nLIZ He... I... (flaring again) What do you care? What do you care about Black Rock? \nMACREEDY Nothing much. Only, there're not many places like this in America -- but even one is too many. Because I think something sort of bad happened here. (frowning) Something I can't find the handle to... \nLIZ You just think so. You don't know. \nMACREEDY This much I know -- the rule of law has been suspended in this town. The gorillas have taken over. \nLIZ You're a fine one to talk! You come in here, sneaking around, trying to steal the key to my jeep. \nMACREEDY I kind of had a notion that was the only way I could get it. \nShe opens her mouth to answer, but she doesn't know what to say. \nMACREEDY (simply) Was I wrong, Miss Brooks? \nMACREEDY What's so funny? \nSMITH Nothing. It's just -- I don't believe you. I believe a man is as big as what he seeks. I believe you're a big man, Mr. Macreedy. \nMACREEDY Flattery will get you nowhere. \nSMITH Why would a man like you be looking for a lousy Jap farmer? \nMACREEDY Maybe I'm not so big. \nSMITH Yes, you are. (a beat; looking hard at Macreedy) I believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad. Nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad. \nMACREEDY What makes you mad, Mr. Smith? \nSMITH Me...? Nothing in particular. \nMACREEDY (bemused) I see. You're a big man, too. Only... (calmly) ...the Japanese make you mad... \nSMITH That's different. After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor... after Bataan... \nMACREEDY ...and Komako made you mad. \nSMITH It's the same thing. (scoffing) Loyal Japanese-Americans -- that's a laugh. They're mad dogs. Look at Corregidor, the death march. \nMACREEDY What did Komako have to do with Corregidor? \nSMITH Wasn't he a Jap? Look, Macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs. But if I see a mad dog loose, I don't wait for him to bite me. (exhales sharply, shaking his head with irritation) I swear, you're beginning to make me mad. \nMACREEDY (calmly) All strangers do. \nSMITH Not all. Some of 'em. When they come here snooping. \nMACREEDY Snooping for what? \nSMITH I mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something. \nMACREEDY (pressing) For what? \nSMITH I don't know. People are always looking for something in this part of the West. To the historian, it's the \"Old West.\" To the book writers, it's the \"Wild West.\" To the businessmen, it's the \"Undeveloped West.\" They all say we're backward and poor, and I guess we are. (snorts) We don't even have enough water. (a beat) But this place, to us, is our West. (heatedly) I just wish they'd leave us alone. \nMACREEDY Leave you alone to do what? \nSMITH (coldly) I don't know what you mean. \nMACREEDY What happened to Komako? \nSMITH He went away, I told you. Shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place. They burned it down. It was one of those things -- you know how kids are. \nMacreedy laughs quietly. \nSMITH What's funny? \nMACREEDY Nothing. Only -- I don't believe you. Any more than I believed you about the letters. \nSMITH (smiling) You don't seem to believe anything I say. \nMACREEDY (vaguely) Yes, I do -- about businessmen, for instance. I think a businessman would be interested in Adobe Flat. \nSMITH Why? \nMACREEDY All that land lying fallow. Could be put to some use. Like a graveyard. (Smith opens his mouth to speak but Macreedy goes on) A historian might be interested, too. Because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle... \nSMITH Burying cattle...? \nMACREEDY (calmly) Something's buried out there. \na cubbyhole behind the hotel clerk's desk in the lobby. At the switchboard is Pete, and above him tacked on the wall is the sign: \nSMILE \nPETE (into phone) (he looks up) \nCAMERA PULLS BACK revealing Smith standing beside him. The two men exchange a nod. \nPETE (into phone) Lines 're busy. (he clicks off the instrument) \nINT. DOC'S LAB \nMacreedy slowly puts down the phone. Doc sips his milk, all the while staring queasily over the glass at Macreedy. He puts it down, his gaze still fixed on the stranger... \nDOC (sing-song) I know -- don't tell me -- lines all busy. They'll be busy all day. \nMACREEDY (after a beat, grimacing) Don't look at me like that. \nDOC Like what? \nMACREEDY Like I'm a potential customer. \nDOC Everybody is -- and I get 'em coming and going. \nHe goes to a topographic map hanging on the wall -- a large, impressive map -- faded, fly-blown and divided into sections. \nDOC (gesturing toward it) First I sell 'em a piece of land. Think they farm it? Nope. They dig for gold. \nHe moves to photograph beside the map on the wall -- a large, impressive photograph of a placer mine in operation. \nDOC They rip off the top soil of ten winding hills. They sprint in here, fog-heaved with excitement, lugging nuggets, big and bright and shiny. \nHe moves to his desk, picks up a glistening blob of stone, resting next to an assayer's scales, and examines it... \nDOC (rhetorically) Is it gold? \nHe bangs the rock down next to the scales. \nDOC It is not! Do they quit? They do not! \nHe moves to a third illustration -- a colored reproduction, large and impressive -- of acres upon green acres of produce in bloom; the kind of picture Southern Pacific places above its calendars. \nDOC (with theatrical gesture toward reproduction) Then they decide to farm. Farm! In country so dry you have to prime a man before he can spit, and before you can say \"Fat Sam\" they're stalled, stranded and starving. They get weevil- brained and buttsprung... \nHe moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his hand down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness. \nDOC (simply) So I bury 'em. (a beat, as he rejoins Macreedy in the center of the room) But why should I bore you with my triumphs? \nMACREEDY Yeah. I've got a problem of my own. \nDoc nods; he points vaguely toward the street... \nDOC (like an old testament prophet) They're going to kill you with no hard feelings. \nMACREEDY (nastily) And you'll just sit on your hands and let them. \nDOC Don't get waspish with me, young feller. \nMACREEDY Sorry. \nDOC I feel for you, but I'm consumed with apathy. Why should I mix in? \nMACREEDY To save a life. \nDOC I got enough trouble saving my own. (he refills his glass from a milk bottle on the desk) I try to live right and drink my orange juice every day. But mostly I try to mind my own business. Which is something I'd advise you to do. \nHECTOR (triumphantly, holding up the wires) Yep. It's the wirin'. \nStill gripping the wires, he walks off. Doc simmers down. He turns to face Macreedy, who hasn't moved. Now Macreedy slowly lowers the hood of the car. \nDOC (softly, after a beat) I'm sorry, son. You got to admit, I tried. \nMACREEDY (as if to himself) Maybe... \nDOC Maybe what? \nMACREEDY If I can't get out of town, maybe I can get the state cops in. \nDOC (irritably) You tried the phone, didn't you? You know what happened, don't you? \nMACREEDY There's another way. I'll be seeing you, Doc. \nHe walks off. Doc looks after him grimly. \nDOC (calling) I hope you'll be seeing me. \nQUICK DISSOLVE: \nINT. TELEGRAPH AGENT'S OFFICE \nMacreedy stands at the high counter, writing on a Postal Telegraph blank. Behind the counter, watching him nervously, is Hastings. At the agent's elbow is a big pitcher with dew on the glass. It holds a pale liquid and a chunk of ice. His eyes on Macreedy, Hastings refills a glass tumbler. He takes a gulp as Macreedy puts down the pencil and pushes the message toward him. Now Hastings puts down his glass, picks up the form and scans it hurriedly. He looks at Macreedy, eyes glazed with anxiety... \nHASTINGS You notifyin' the state po-lice? \nMACREEDY (putting a bill on the counter) That's what it says. \nHastings again refills his glass, slopping the liquid over on the counter. He picks up the glass, hesitates, offers it awkwardly to Macreedy. \nHASTINGS (plaintively) Lemonade? \nMacreedy shakes his head. No. \nHASTINGS (mopping his forehead) It's hot as Billy-be-durned. \nHe drinks, puts down the glass. Macreedy pushes the bill across the counter toward him. Hastings picks it up gingerly then pauses... \nHASTINGS Don't you like lemonade? \nMACREEDY I never thought much about it. \nHASTINGS It don't have the muzzle velocity of some other drinks drunk around here, but it's good for what ails you. \nMACREEDY (after a beat) What ails you, Mr. Hastings? \nHASTINGS Me...? \nMACREEDY Why are you so upset about... (points) ...this wire? \nHASTINGS Me...? \nMACREEDY Are you afraid, Mr. Hastings? \nHASTINGS Me...? (a beat, then softly) I guess I am. (awkwardly he puts Macreedy's bill back on the counter) But what's the use talkin'...? (with grudging respect) You don't know what it's like, being scared. \nMACREEDY (not unsympathetically) You want me to describe the symptoms? Right this minute I'm scared half to death. \nHASTINGS (simply) You should be. \nMACREEDY Yeah. But not of the state police. \nHASTINGS (stonily) Neither am I. \nMACREEDY In that case, I'll have it. And a cup of coffee. \nThe door of the Bar & Grill opens. Smith and Coley enter. They walk to Macreedy, stopping just a few feet behind him. \nCOLEY (to Macreedy, with menacing friendliness) You still around? I thought you didn't like this place. \nMACREEDY (pleasantly) Going to, or coming from? \nCOLEY Staying put. \nMACREEDY No comment. \nHe turns again as Sam plops an unseasonable mess of chili in front of him. \nCOLEY (to Smith, gesturing a thumb toward Macreedy) No comment, he says. No comment, and all the time he's got my chair. \nMacreedy smiles tiredly. He half turns toward Coley. \nMACREEDY I always seem to be taking somebody's place around here. \nHe gets up, with his chili, and sits down three stools away. Coley straddles the stool Macreedy has vacated. He squirms on it, his movements exaggerated. Now he spins to face Smith. \nCOLEY This seat ain't comfortable. \nMACREEDY I was afraid of that. \nCOLEY I think I'd like the seat you're on. \nSMITH (to Macreedy, mildly) He's as changeable as a prairie fire. \nMACREEDY (to Coley) Suppose you tell me where to sit. \nColey opens his mouth but, realizing he has been outmaneuvered, closes it again. The loafers in b.g. are silent, watching. Sam, seemingly oblivious to Coley's pressure on Macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the stranger. Coley gets up slowly and walks stiff-legged to Macreedy. He takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing the cap, upends it over Macreedy's plate. The cap is drowned in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs onto the counter. \nCOLEY (to Macreedy) I hope that ain't too much. \nMACREEDY (to Smith, gesturing toward Coley) Your friend's a very [...] fellow. \nSMITH (nodding) Sort of unpredictable, too. Got a temper like a rattlesnake. \nCOLEY That's me all over. I'm half hoss, half alligator. Mess with me, I'll kick a lung outta you. What do you think of that? \nMACREEDY No comment. \nCOLEY Talking to you is like pulling teeth. You wear me out. (loudly, after a beat) You're a yellow-bellied Jap lover. Am I right or wrong? \nMACREEDY You're not only wrong -- you're wrong at the top of your voice. \nCOLEY You don't like my voice? \nMACREEDY (again turning to Smith) I think your friend's trying to start something. \nSMITH Now why-ever would he want to do that? \nMACREEDY I don't know. Maybe he figures, needle me enough and I'll crack. Maybe I'll even fight back. Then he or Hector -- your other ape -- would beat me to death and cop a plea of self-defense. \nSMITH I don't think that'll be necessary. You're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat. \nCOLEY Before that happens, couldn't I pick a fight with you if I tied one hand behind me...? \nMacreedy rises to go out. As he passes Coley, Coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. The two men face each other. \nCOLEY If I tied both hands...? \nMacreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious. \nHe continues to advance inexorably toward Pete. \nPETE (flatly) You shouldn' of got off. \nMACREEDY Had to. I had one last duty to perform before I resigned from the human race. \nDOC (quizzically) I thought you were going to Los Angeles, that hot-bed of pomp and vanity. Is that resigning from the human race? \nMACREEDY (shrugging) L.A.'s a good jumping off place -- for the Islands, for Mexico, Central America. \nDOC Why? \nMACREEDY (again shrugs) I don't know. I was looking for a place to get lost, I guess. \nDOC Why? \nMACREEDY (slapping his paralyzed arm with the whisky bottle) Because of this. I thought I'd never be able to function again. (turning to Pete) Thanks to your friend Smith, I found I was wrong. \nHe is now within a couple of yards of Pete. \nPETE (drily) Sure. You're a man of action. \nMACREEDY (slowly) I know your problem. (with mounting vigor) You'd like me to die quickly, without wasting too much of your time... (Pete opens his mouth to say something, but Macreedy presses on) ...or silently, without making you feel too uncomfortable... or thankfully, without making your memories of the occasion too unpleasant. \nFor a moment Pete stares at Macreedy, terribly disturbed by the incisiveness of Macreedy's analysis. Then... \nPETE (bitterly) My memories are so pleasant as it is... \nIn sudden frustration, Pete grabs the deck of cards on the clerk's desk and slams them down hard. They scatter. He turns, stares blankly [...] between Doc and Macreedy. \nMACREEDY (quietly pressing his advantage) What happened, Pete? \nPete doesn't answer. \nDOC Are you going to tell him -- or you want me to? (beat) Smith owns Adobe Flat. He leased it to Komako -- thought he had cheated him, thought Komako could never even run stock without water. There was never any water on Adobe Flat. Komako dug a well, by hand. He must have went down one hundred and fifty feet. \nPETE He got water, plenty. Smith was pretty sore. He didn't like Japs anyway. \nDOC That's an understatement. \nPETE The day after Pearl Harbor, Smith went to Sand City. \nMACREEDY (interrupting) I know. To enlist. He was turned down. \nPETE He was sore when he got back. About ten o'clock he started drinking. \nMACREEDY Ten o'clock in the morning. \nPETE Yeah. Hector joined him, and Coley. Then Sam, and about nine p.m. -- me. We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk. We went out to Komako's for a little fun, I guess -- scare him a little. \nMACREEDY Did you know him? \nPETE We'd seen him around some, but none of us knew him. When he heard us coming, he locked the door. Smith started a fire. The Jap came running out. His clothes were burning. Smith shot him. I didn't even know Smith had a gun. \nMACREEDY Then you all got scared, buried him, kept quiet. \nPete nods helplessly, bowing his head. Macreedy sighs, looks down at the bottle in his hand, slowly puts it on the table... \nMACREEDY (softly) Did Komako have any family besides his son Joe? \nDOC (puzzled) His son...? Nobody around here knew he had a son. \nMACREEDY He had one. But he's dead, too. He's buried in Italy. \nDOC What are you doing here, Mr. Macreedy? \nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT \nThe congregation of loafers look up as Hector emerges. Imbued with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy tricks. Then he sighs as boredom again takes over. He walks down the steps to catch a bit of air. \nINT. LOBBY - DOC AND PETE \nThe disappearance of Hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes them into action. They hurry out of the lobby toward the back of the hotel. \nEXT. ALLEY - BEHIND HOTEL - NIGHT \nVague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. The hotel's rear door is tightly shut. Around the far corner of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of Hector David. He walks toward CAMERA. Perhaps twenty-five yards away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower. \nCLOSE SHOT - HECTOR \nHis hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half pack of cigarettes. Suddenly the movement is arrested; something at the other end of the street captures his bleak attention. \nWHAT HE SEES \nA jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to the curb and parks. \nBACK TO SCENE - HECTOR \npockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a quizzical frown on his horsy face. He approaches the back door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward the jeep. \nINT. REAR HALLWAY OF HOTEL - NIGHT \nAt the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With enormous care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the alley, glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. Glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc. He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end. \nDoc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallows nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension. \nEXT. ALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING PETE \nas he stares at Hector walking toward the jeep. \nPETE (controlling his jangled nerves) Hector! \nHector stops, turns to face Pete. He hesitates, then... \nHECTOR Hmmmm? \nThen, with a final glance at the jeep, Hector lumbers to Pete, who disappears inside the hallway. \nINT. REAR HALLWAY \nas Hector enters and stops. Pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw Hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. But Hector is not to be sucked in. He glares at Pete, waiting. (NOTE: The following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.) \nHECTOR What you want? \nPETE He's still in his room. Macreedy, I mean. \nHECTOR So...? You want me to tuck him in? \nPETE I thought maybe you wanted to tell Smith. \nHECTOR (explaining something he feels Pete already knows) Smith said he'd be here at midnight. He don't want to be disturbed. \nHe jams a cigarette in his mouth. Pete watches him frantically as he searches his pockets for a match. He can't find one. \nHECTOR You got a match? \nPETE Come on. I got some in the lobby. \nHe starts to turn. Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt. Slowly Hector's expression changes to one of insidious cunning. His fingers come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book of matches. \nHECTOR I thought you didn't have a match. \nLIZ I lack the muscle. \nMACREEDY (frowning) Why is muscle so important? \nLIZ (cynically) Oh, you're the brainy type. (harshly) Did it take brains to rough up Coley? Whatever you did to Hector, you didn't do it with brains. How'd you get Pete to change his mind? \nMACREEDY Not with muscle. \nLIZ And not with brains, either. He's a pushover for a muscle man. \nMACREEDY I'm beginning' to think it runs in the family. (looking at her hard) You think strength is in the width of a man's shoulders. \nHe does not catch the glance she darts him; his extreme awareness is anchored not to the girl at his side but to the terrain ahead. \nLIZ I'd sure have liked to see you tangle with Reno Smith. \nMACREEDY He wasn't around when I left... Maybe I will yet. \nHis eyes strain to sweep the country -- each boulder, each outcropping, each stunted tree. But substance and shadow are blurred and fuzzy in the dark night, black on black. \nOUT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nANOTHER ANGLE - JEEP \nwith Macreedy and Liz as it winds to the far end of the boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin. Solid forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet Macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain... He frowns. Suddenly Liz brakes the jeep -- so sharply Macreedy lurches forward in the seat. \nMACREEDY (alert, expectant) What's this? \nLIZ (vamping nervously) We need water... (she turns off engine, pulling ignition key from its lock) ...radiator's overheating. \nShe moves away from Macreedy to get out of the jeep. He reaches across quickly, gripping her arm. She turns to face him, disturbed by his hardness of jaw and eye... \nLIZ Leggo! Leggo of me! \nSuddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like [...] The beams cut jaggedly through the night, throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks, the broken windmill, the gutted house, the litter-strewn, unmarked grave at Adobe Flat. \nLiz throws away the ignition key. Macreedy bails out of the jeep, still holding the girl. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT - LIZ AND MACREEDY \nas they fall to the earth. Macreedy pins her down. Then in quick succession, four emphatically loud SHOTS from a rifle squirt into the shale around them. \nMACREEDY (harshly, through his teeth) You're stupid, Liz. You're a fool. If he finishes me, he's got to finish you. \nHe looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some 60 yards away. His grip on the girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. He pushes her down beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a SHOT rips the gravel at their feet. Pulling the girl with him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them and the source of the gunfire. Liz struggles to break away. Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. A bullet smashes into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into Macreedy's face. He gasps in pain, releasing Liz. He rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. Liz breaks from the grave. Now, five yards from Macreedy... \nLIZ (calling toward the headlights) Smitty! Smitty! \nSMITH'S VOICE (o.s.) I'm here, honey. Just head for the car. \nLiz half turns, facing Macreedy with a vicious smile... \nLIZ (an almost bantering voice) So long, Macreedy. \nShe starts toward the headlights. \nGO WITH LIZ \nShe reaches the foot of the rocky ridge, with the two enormous eyes on top. She begins to climb, up... up... \nSMITH (o.s.) Just a few more steps, honey. \nShe is almost at the top; a vertically sheer rock about five feet high separates her from it. She looks up at Smith, towering over her at the edge of the precipice. He holds his rifle almost languorously. \n", "test1_input": "He takes a belt that would incapacitate half the county. He finishes, smacks his lips, lays the bottle down, and falls into a chair. He looks up at Macreedy. \nTIM (suddenly mean) What're you lookin' at? \nMACREEDY (easy) You tell me. \nTIM (after a beat, relaxing) I ain't always this bad -- just that last night me and my pal Doc Velie, we did a little celebratin'. At least I did. \nMACREEDY What were you celebrating? \nTIM (shrugs) You name it. (studies Macreedy) What do you want? \nMACREEDY My name's Macreedy. I came in on the Streamliner. \nTim studies him, trying to focus. \nTIM You what? \nMACREEDY I said I came in... \nTIM (interrupting) You ain't from around here. Up Tucson way -- Phoenix? Mesa? You ain't sellin' cattle nor seed nor nothin' like that? \nMACREEDY No. (sighs, then distinctly as to a child) All I want from you is a little information. I've got to get to a place called Adobe Flat. \nTIM (reacts; then, tight- lipped) This ain't no information bureau. \nMacreedy starts to say something, then stops. Reconsidering... \nMACREEDY One thing about Black Rock -- everybody's polite. Makes for gracious living. \nTIM Nobody asked you here. \nMACREEDY How do you know? (he moves toward the door, with a rueful grin) \nTIM (starting after him) What about Adobe Flat? \nMACREEDY I'm looking for a man named Komako. \nThe Sheriff reaches for his bottle. In his haste he drops it. Macreedy's hand moves quickly, catching the bottle before it hits the floor. \nMACREEDY Almost a disaster. \nTIM (sinking back in his chair) A fate worse'n death. (he takes the bottle from Macreedy) You move fast for a crip... for a big man. \nFor a moment heavy silence. Finally... \nMACREEDY What about Komako? \nTIM (slowly) If there's no further questions... \nMacreedy grins harshly and exits. Tim watches him go, then slowly reaches for the bottle. He pauses, looks at his shaking hand. Then he withdraws it and just sits in the chair staring blindly ahead, seeing nothing. \nEXT. STREET \nFrowning, deep in thought, Macreedy walks down the dusty street. As he reaches the hotel... \nSMITH (o.s.) Mr. Macreedy. \nMacreedy stops, looks toward Smith as he walks out to meet him. \nMACREEDY That's the friendliest word I've heard since I got here. \nAs Smith joins him, he walks on. Smith falls in step beside him. GO WITH THEM. \nSMITH (grins boyishly) My name is Smith. I own the Triple- Bar ranch. (holds out his hand; Macreedy shakes it) I want to apologize for some of the folks in town. \n", "test1_true": "SMITH A keg...? Of what? \nMACREEDY I don't know. Maybe diamonds. Maybe gunpowder. \nSMITH (disarmingly) No. Nothing like that. We're a little suspicious of strangers is all. Hangover from the old days. The old West. \nMACREEDY I thought the tradition of the old West was hospitality. \nSMITH (with a sincere smile) I'm trying to be hospitable, Mr. Macreedy. (boyishly pushes his dusty cap back on his head) Going to be around for a while? \nMACREEDY Could be. \nSMITH How would you like to go hunting tomorrow? I'd be proud to have you as my guest. \nMACREEDY Thanks, but I'm afraid not. \nSMITH (with admirable candor) You mean, because of your arm? (slaps Macreedy's shoulder in a friendly, understanding gesture) I knew a man once, lost an arm in a threshing accident. Used to hunt all the time. (almost too blandly) But he was quite a man. He... (pauses; then, with discreet and charming gravity) I'm sorry. I... What I mean is -- if there's anything I can do while you're around... \nMACREEDY I'm looking for... (sighs) Never mind. Thanks, anyway. \nSMITH (quietly) You're looking for what, Mr. Macreedy? \nMACREEDY (eyeing him) A man named Komako. \nSMITH (no hesitation) Komako -- Sure, I remember him -- Japanese farmer. Never had a chance. \nMACREEDY No? \nSMITH He got here in '41 -- just before Pearl Harbor. Three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers. (shaking his head) Tough. \nMACREEDY Which one did he go to? \nSMITH Who knows? \nMACREEDY You think maybe if I wrote him, the letter would be forwarded? \nSMITH I'm sure it would. Write your letter. I'll see it gets out tonight. \nMACREEDY It wouldn't be too much trouble? \nSMITH No trouble at all. \nMACREEDY Funny. Because I think it would be a great deal of trouble for you. It's been a great deal of trouble for me. \nAt this point they are in front of... \nEXT. LIZ'S GARAGE \nMacreedy stops, as does Smith. He looks keenly at Smith as he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half-dozen letters... \nMACREEDY I wrote these letters to Komako. They weren't forwarded. They were returned -- address unknown. (he smiles grimly at Smith) So I guess there's nothing you can do for me, after all. \nSmith opens his mouth to reply when the NOISE of a jeep o.s. interrupts him. The jeep comes INTO SHOT. Liz Brooks, at the wheel, cuts the engine and jumps out. Smith ambles silently to a wall and leans against it. Liz reaches behind the driver's seat and hoists, with both hands and some effort, a five-gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep. As she rests it on the rear fender... \nMACREEDY (going to her) Need a little help? \nThe girl looks at Smith, who has made no attempt to help her. \nLIZ I can manage. \nShe lifts the drum to the ground. \nMACREEDY Well, I need a little help. (she looks at him questioningly) I'd like to rent your jeep. \n", "test1_id": 411, "test2_input": "Smith scans the message. He looks up to meet Macreedy's gaze. Smith rises. Hector swaggers over from the slot machine. Hastings slips around the back of the couch, protected by the barricade of Hector's great body. \nMACREEDY (evenly, to Smith) I think that's for me. (he takes the message from Smith's hand and quickly glances at it. Looking up at Hastings) Where's the answer? \nHastings is silent. A brittle expression of bemusement crosses Smith's features. \nSMITH You expect an answer -- to a wire that's never sent? \nMacreedy's mouth compresses in a harsh grin. \nSMITH What's so funny? \nMACREEDY Nothing. Just a thought -- (his eyes turn to Hastings. Hastings wilts) -- a thought dazzling in its purity... \nMacreedy takes a step toward Hastings. The telegraph agent bounces away. \nMACREEDY (slowly) You're in a jam, Hastings. You gave my telegram to Smith. \nDOC (excitedly) You warty wretch! That's a federal offense! \nMACREEDY (to Smith) You're in deep, too. (grins hard) Like I said, it's getting tougher and tougher. (to Tim) Sheriff, you'd better do something about this. \nTim hesitates, blinking his eyes worriedly, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other. Smith watches him insolently as he takes the message from Macreedy and gestures with it vaguely... \nTIM (to Smith) I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith... \nHECTOR Don't be a jerk, Tim. \nTIM (to Smith, seriously) Divulging information -- there's a law... \nSMITH Tim, you're pathetic. \nTIM (doggedly) Could be. But I'm still Sheriff. \nSMITH That's the point. You're not Sheriff any more. You just lost a job, you're so pathetic. \nHe reaches out, clawing the badge from Tim's chest. He jabs it on Hector's vest. \nSMITH (to Hector) All right, Sheriff. Take over. \nDOC You can't do that! \nSMITH Can't I? I put him in office. Now I take him out. \nHector moves his elephantine bulk within inches of Macreedy... \nHECTOR Now. You want to register a complaint? \nMacreedy doesn't answer. Hector takes the message from Tim's limp hand and tears it into little pieces. \nHECTOR To register a complaint, boy, you've got to have evidence. You got evidence? \nMacreedy doesn't answer. \nHECTOR You got a big mouth, boy, makin' accusations, disturbin' the peace. There's laws in this county protectin' innocent folks from big mouths. Why, I'd just hate to... \nSMITH (interrupting) Hector... (wearily) Come on, Hector. \nHe walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in the lobby. \nMacreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to Tim. Tim takes a drink. \nThe light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness. \nDOC (hopefully) It's all right, Tim. We're not licked yet. \n", "test2_true": "DOC There comes a time, Tim, when a man's just got to do something. \nTIM Not me. I'm useless, and I know it. \nDOC (imploring) No man is useless, if he's got a friend... \nPete comes out from behind the desk, walking from one lamp in the lobby to another, turning them on. \nDOC I'm your friend, Tim. \nTIM Then let me alone. \nHe hands Doc the whiskey bottle. \nDOC (jabbing at Macreedy with a thumb) He's going to need you before the night is over. \nHe downs a snort, then looks at Pete, who approaches them. \nDOC (contemptuously) And all the useful men are on the other side. \nAs Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc, he reacts ever so slightly to Doc's words. His almost imperceptible grimace is not lost on Macreedy. Macreedy watches the young man as he continues to light the lamps... \nTIM (angrily) Lemme alone, I tell ya! \nDoc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table. \nDOC I can't let you alone! I can't let myself alone! Don't you understand that? (he turns from Tim to Pete, who is unable to shake his gaze. Then, sadly, fiercely) Four years ago something terrible happened here. We did nothing about it. Nothing. The whole town fell into a sort of settled melancholy, and the people in it closed their eyes and held their tongues and failed the test with a whimper. \nSelf-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans against the outside of the clerk's desk. But he still can't shut his ears to what Doc is saying... \nDOC Now something terrible is going to happen again, and in a way we're lucky because we've been given a second chance. And this time I won't close my eyes, I won't hold my tongue, and if I'm needed I won't fail. (almost harshly, again facing Tim) And neither will you! \nTim sighs, running a thick hand over his forehead... \nTIM I got such a headache, I'm bewildered. I hurt all over. \nMACREEDY I know -- (unconsciously his right arm strays to massage the paralyzed left) -- pain is bewildering. I came here bewildered, full of self-pity, afraid to fight back. (gesturing with his hand to Pete) And then your friend Smith tried to kill me. (the muscles around Pete's mouth tighten) Funny, how a man clings to the earth when he feels there's a chance he may never see it again. \nDOC There's a difference between clinging to the earth... (eyeing Tim almost contemptuously) ...and crawling on it. You going to stand by and watch forever? \nTIM (flatly) I ain't gonna watch, and I ain't gonna get into it, either. \nThere is a moment of crashing silence. Then... \nTIM I'm gettin' out. I'm sorry, Mr. Macreedy. \nSlowly he lumbers out of the lobby. Doc watches him go. Again the benumbing silence, cut finally, unexpectedly by... \nPETE (to Doc) You'd be smart to get out, too. \nDOC (angrily turning to Pete) There's too many smart guys around here. I'm glad I'm a dummy. \nPETE You're a troublesome dummy. You're liable to end up on your own slab... \nDOC (heatedly) I expect to be in a lot more trouble before I die... \nPETE Go home, Doc. (he jerks his head toward Macreedy, and with mock bravado...) He's all washed up. \nMACREEDY (grinning harshly at him) You think so? \nHis right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey bottle on the end table. Abstractedly fingering it, he walks with tense, deliberate steps toward Pete at the desk. \nMACREEDY I was washed up when I got off that train... \n", "test2_id": 412, "test3_input": "He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her... \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. BLACK ROCK - DAY (DAWN) \nLiz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty main street of the sleeping town. Behind him, under a tarp, the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He wears a sullen expression of pained indifference. \nIn b.g., as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in Doc's house, then in two or three others. Macreedy is oblivious to them. \nEXT. JAIL - CLOSE SHOT - A MAN \nalmost completely hidden, looks out grimly from a corner of the jail window. Protruding through the bars, swiveling to follow the progress of the jeep down the street, is the long, ugly muzzle of a rifle. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - JEEP \nas Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and cuts the ignition. He grabs the rifle, and steps around to Smith. \nMACREEDY (tonelessly, prodding Smith off the fender with his rifle) Hands behind your head. \nSmith complies. \nEXT. JAIL \nas Macreedy marches Smith up the steps. The jail door opens. A man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying a rifle. It is Tim. For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence. His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand. Tim's rifle, too, is at the ready... \nMACREEDY (after a beat) Am I going to have trouble with you? \nTIM Nope. But I sure thought the situation was going to be like reversed. I thought I was going to have trouble... (nodding sharply in Smith's direction) ...with him. I'll take care of him. \nMACREEDY (still hesitating) Just as you took care of his buddies? \nTIM Just as I took care of his buddies. Me, an' Doc, and Pete... \nThe SOUND of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on SOUND TRACK. Macreedy turns slightly, to see Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand-off. \nDOC (to Macreedy) It's all right, Macreedy... \nHe pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver- plated star pinned at the breast. \nDOC Old Tim here's got his badge back. \nMacreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits silently at Tim's desk. \nINT. JAIL \nIn one of the two cells are Coley and Hector. In the other, Sam and Hastings. \nMACREEDY (looking around) Well. The gang is all here. \nTIM I thought I'd take one last whack at my job. Even if Smith killed me for it. \nMACREEDY (jerking his head toward Smith) Put him in with Hastings. \nTim turns his key in the cell door. Macreedy tiredly goes to Pete at the desk. \nMACREEDY Your sister's outside, Pete. \nPete rises. Macreedy halts him momentarily, gripping his arm... \nMACREEDY (flatly) She's dead. \nPete walks dazedly out the door. Tim grabs Smith's shoulder and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly... \nDISSOLVE: \n", "test3_true": "The townspeople, with Doc f.g., are gathered silently in the street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. Doc wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting with expectancy. \nWHAT THEY SEE \nMacreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream- liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately Doc falls in step with him. The townspeople, still silent, trail after them \nMOVING SHOT - MACREEDY AND DOC \nin f.g., the townspeople behind them. In b.g., as we pass, we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered town a few short hours ago. \nMACREEDY (walking, after a beat, to Doc) Tim knows where to find me if I'm needed. \nDoc nods. He blinks and frowns... \nMACREEDY What's on your mind, Doc? \nDOC Nothing. Only... about that medal. Can we have it? \nMACREEDY \"We...?\" Can who have it? \nDOC We. (indicating the townspeople, with a vague wave of his hand) Us. \nMACREEDY Why? \nDOC Well, we need it, I guess. It's something we can maybe build on. This town is wrecked, just as bad as if it was bombed out. Maybe it can come back... \nMACREEDY Some towns come back. Some don't. It depends on the people. \nA NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do Doc and the townsmen. \nWHAT THEY SEE \nIn front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMacreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with Doc at his side and the people behind him. The train pulls in. \nDOC (still pressing) That medal would help. \nMacreedy is silent. He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it to Doc. \nDOC Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for everything. \nMacreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after him. \nEXT. PLATFORM \nas Macreedy boards the train. \nEXT. STREET \nThe cars in front of the jail U-turn and start off with the prisoners. The people move silently toward the train. \nEXT. TRAIN \nMacreedy is at the passageway. Slowly the train moves out. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY OF TRAIN \nMacreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway. The town is seen behind them and the people standing there. In the distance, Tim's car recedes. \nCONDUCTOR (curiously) What's the excitement? What happened? \n", "test3_id": 413}

KENDALL You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller? 
MUELLER (mocking gay lisp) You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller? 
Mueller and Childs laugh, but Nunez looks concerned. 
NUNEZ You really heard this? 
PIKE You know Popham, works in the kitchen? He told me it was on the radio. He stops, listening.    They all hear the WIND, HOWLING outside. KENDALL We should tell him we're not going. MUELLER Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out - we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland. He pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door, Nunez right behind him. The others, getting ready, all except Kendall. Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder. DUNBAR He's right.    We don't have a choice. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while yelling above the wind. WEST A rifle, a pistol, and three phosphorous grenades to a man! This is live fire, so keep those safetied until we touch down; I don't want anyone shooting their dick off! Some chuckling. WEST Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather - they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me? THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! WEST LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two (MORE) 
WEST (CONT'D) and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows - Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs! Mueller groans. WEST I will be in the areas monitoring your progress and if I see anyone drag ass I will personally slit you stem to sternum and leave you for dead! Fall out! The Cadets board the Transport Chopper. Kendall gets on last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him: WEST You're gonna die tonight, faggot. INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY Osborne looks up. OSBORNE He said what? KENDALL "You're gonna die tonight, faggot" . Clear as day. OSBORNE No one else heard it? KENDALL He whispered it in my ear. Hardy scratches his temple. HARDY Levi, I don't know   if you're familiar with investigative   work, but we have this little thing   called "motive" and you just gave   yourself one. KENDALL You said you wanted to know what happened- I'm telling you the truth. HARDY What happened to "degrees"? 
KENDALL Didn't kill him- HARDY Then who did? INT. ARMY TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- LAST NIGHT On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence. terrified he looks like he's about to throw up. KENDALL (V.O.) I wanted to tell someone what he'd said, but I couldn't. Mueller would just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't care. Pike and Dunbar were okay, but... When West outed me, he isolated me. An outcast among outcasts. And I'd just been told tonight was the night I'd die. The Chopper touches down on the edge of the BAYOU. The door rumbles open as West points out different team directions in the blackness. WEST First team, second team, third team, go, go, go! The click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out of the helicopter. EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. Moving the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets. KENDALL (V.O.) I knew Childs a little, we worked at the PX together. The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.   Their ponchos flap loudly against the elements. KENDALL (V.O.) I started getting it in my head that maybe West had paid him, maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident- The ROAR of GUNFIRE!  Kendall turns  towards it,  SCREAMING for a moment... Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle, a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front  of them.   He looks down, noticing has his own weapon TRAINED  ON CHILDS.  .. Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away. 
CHILDS Don't you ever point a gun at me!

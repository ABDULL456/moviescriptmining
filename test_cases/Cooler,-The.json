{"test1_input": "BUDDY Whassimatter, kid? You got that Nostradamus look. \nShelly shakes his head. \nBUDDY You ever watch those nature shows on TV? \nShelly shakes his head. \nBUDDY I've seen this one a dozen times. It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. The leader of the pack... \nSHELLY Pride. It's called a pride. \nBUDDY Yeah, pride. The leader of the pride... when he gets on in years. It's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him. They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him. It's humiliating. In front of all the females, this goes down. And after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush. \nSHELLY Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense of humor. \nBUDDY No shit. It's fucking tragic because the old lion can't figure it out on his own. That he's past it. It'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation. \nSHELLY That's like admitting to yourself that you're already dead. I prefer nature's way. \nBUDDY (a beat) Yeah. Me, too. \nShelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror. \nINT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT \nShelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on him. \nHe's accompanied by a good looking YOUNG MAN. \nLARRY Shelly, got a minute... \nShelly's expression: no. But he heads over anyway. \nLARRY Shelly, this is Johnny Capella. \nJOHNNY How ya doin', Shelly? \nJohnny extends his hand. Shelly ignores the gesture. \nSHELLY I know you from somewhere, right? \nLARRY Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage. Sony's talking about signing him to a three album deal. They're positioning him as the new Ricki Martin. \nSHELLY And I should be interested in this, why? \nLARRY Johnny's looking to headline. I told him we might be interested. \nSHELLY (icy) We? \nJOHNNY Hey, if this is a bad time... \nSHELLY Even if I were interested, Buddy's got ink with us through 2003. I just renegotiated his contract last year. \nJOHNNY Sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page. (to Larry) If I don't hear from you by Thursday, I'm taking the Stardust's offer. \nJohnny nods at Shelly, takes off. Shelly and Larry eyeball each other for a long, cold beat. Shelly's about to say something, when Nicky and Marty approach. Larry shrugs, flashes a chilling smile. \nNICKY Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old fart a drink. \nSHELLY Buddy asked me to send you his regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so great. I think he's got that stomach flu that's going around. \nNICKY Oh yeah? That's too bad. (Shelly isn't fooling him) Well, another time then. \nMARTY Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls. Something with class. \n", "test1_true": "SHELLY Sure, no problem. You got any preferences? \nNICKY (jumps in) Yeah. Something with big headlights, nice rims and low mileage. \nMARTY You got any Asian babes? \nShelly looks to Larry. \nLARRY I think I'll just stick with the tables. \nWe linger on Shelly's unsettled look. This guy is bad news. \nEXT. SHANGRI-LA PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nBernie weaves his way through the lot to his car. Arriving at his Buick, he's startled to find Natalie leaning against it. She holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her. \nNATALIE Buy you a drink? \nOff of Bernie's surprised expression... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT \nCheesy Polynesian decor. Mood lighting = an excuse to keep the electric down. Basically, a joint where people come to lose themselves. \nNatalie and Bernie are seated in a booth near the back. She sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin. \nNatalie has an astrological chart in front of her. In between sips, she makes annotations to the chart. \nNATALIE (almost to herself) Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion. Which tells me that you're a slow starter when it comes to romance. (off Bernie's taken aback expression) You know what? This is real unprofessional of me. I shouldn't discuss your chart with you until I'm all done. I can tell by that look, you think this is all a lot of B.S. \nBERNIE No... I just know what the outcome's going to be. \nNATALIE The outcome? There's not, like, one particular outcome. A lot of things enter into it. The planets, moon phases... \nBERNIE The outcome won't change with me. It'll be all bad. \nNATALIE God, I have never met anyone who was so down on themselves. I used to be down on myself, OK? I don't go there anymore. I've got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff, then I'll have my certificate and everything. And you know how I got OK? \nBERNIE (deadpan) You had your chart done. \nNATALIE Yes, as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct. \nBERNIE Do you know what I do at the Shangri- la? \nNATALIE I asked around. You're a \"cooler.\" You turn winners into losers. \nBERNIE And do you know how I do that? \nNATALIE I know there's stuff that goes on in casinos all the time -- \nBERNIE I do it by being myself. People get next to me and their luck turns. It's always been that way. \nNATALIE That sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole chapter on that in my course. Anyways, I can see a big factor in your life is that you're lacking companionship. There's nobody to deflect off. If you've got, as you put it, bad karma, then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it. Well, that's my take on it anyway. \nBernie maintains eye contact with Natalie for an extended beat. Then drops his head, gazes at his glass. \nBERNIE I don't know about you, but I'm real tired. \nNatalie nods. Bernie motions to stand. Natalie just remains seated. Keeps talking. \nNATALIE I have this recurring dream where I'm on some beautiful island in the Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach, taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand (gestures to her drink) ...and then it starts to rain. And I wake up and it's my roof leaking on me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie. \n", "test1_id": 927, "test2_input": "BERNIE (not even sure why he's telling her this) I only got six more days. Well, almost five really. Then I'll be leaving town. \nNATALIE Only five more days? (a beat) Then we shouldn't waste any more time. \nNatalie covers Bernie's hand with hers. \nNATALIE Why don't we go back to your place? \nBERNIE (completely caught off-guard) I, uh... If this is... I don't know... I don't know if I can afford... \nNatalie flinches slightly. Then swiftly regains her composure. It's Vegas. An honest mistake. \nBERNIE Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't mean... You see -- that's exactly what I'm talking about. I've gone and \"cooled\" the damn table. \nNATALIE Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't gone and cooled anything. Not by a long shot. \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nNatalie's hand flips on the television. Another bizarre religious service. We pull back from the screen as she tries to change the channel. Just gets a whole lot of static. \nBernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. \nNATALIE You should complain about this. \nBERNIE I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, all I got's gin. \nNATALIE Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead. \nBernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot. \nNatalie glances around. She notices Bernie's dead plants... \nNATALIE You know, once they're dead, they don't really grow back. In case, that's what you're waiting for. \nHer eyes land on the empty cat bowl. She's about to say something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression. Let's not even go there. She gestures to an old record player in the corner. \nNATALIE So... got any music? \nBernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. Bare shelves... except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's a Sinatra album. Never been opened. \nNatalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon. \nNatalie can't help but smile. \nBernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record. \nEverything seems to be going so well, until... \nSKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard. \nBernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious laugh comes out. \nIt's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing \"This Town,\" a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch. \nNatalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger. He picks up his glass, shuffles over. \nNATALIE Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least one of us has done this before. \nBERNIE This is not my first -- \nNATALIE Sssh. Surprise me. \nShe starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary moans from him. Bernie is almost in tears. Nobody's touched him like this in years. And it shows. \nNatalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, then sets it on the floor. She drops down next to Bernie. \n", "test2_true": "NATALIE You're doing real good. \nThey fall back onto the mattress. Natalie taking the reigns, maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties... \nBernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt. A pair of dice. Both twos. \nIn seconds, Natalie has separated Bernie from his pants and underwear, taking him inside of her, Ol' Blue Eyes keeping the rhythm... \nNatalie moans uninhibitedly. Surprise: she's a real screamer. Moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the wall. Some John telling them to keep it down. \nBernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at Natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp. \nFrank winds down \"This Town\" a few seconds later. Poor Bernie, he didn't even make it through the song. \nBERNIE Sorry... \nNatalie wraps her arms around him. \nNATALIE Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse. We'll try again later. \nBernie rests his head on her breasts. Closes his eyes. We hold on him. A few seconds pass... and he breaks into a smile. \nFade to black. \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nTIGHT on Bernie sleeping. He still has that goofy smile on his lips. A beat or two later, he opens his eyes. We PULL BACK to reveal that he's alone in the bed. No sign of Natalie. \nBernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in it. Takes a deep breath. Moans at her scent. Ambrosia. He still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, when Natalie steps out of the bathroom. Big smile. \nNATALIE Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast? \nBernie just looks up at her; replay on the goofy smile. \nHeaven. \nBERNIE (V.O.) -- I did six months at Rikers for running numbers. It was Shelly's thing, but I took the rap for it. \nINT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nBernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast. \nBERNIE After I get out, I call up Shelly and he tells me to come out here. I figure he's going to set me up good at the Shangri-la. But he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons. So he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts -- trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money. I lasted two weeks. \nAs Bernie talks, Natalie spies a very PREGNANT GIRL (20's) coming out of the restroom. Her eyes follow the girl back to a table where a YOUNG MAN (20's) waits on her. \nBERNIE Already, I was getting in deep. Finally it got so bad, I had to beg Shelly to take on my markers around town. That just bought me more time to keep losing. I put Shelly in an awkward position. I understand why he did what he did. (taps his knee) \nNATALIE He did that to you? What, he shot you? \nBERNIE Baseball bat. (off her cringing expression) I got off easy. \nNATALIE That's getting off easy? \nBERNIE I was out of control. \nNATALIE But he maimed you... \nBERNIE Let me tell you something. I'm grateful for what he did. (off her stunned look) No kidding. Every time I get an urge to play off the clock -- to so much as drop a quarter in a slot -- I reach down and squeeze what's left of my cartilage. It's one helluva reminder. \nNATALIE Jesus... I thought stuff like that didn't happen no more. Like that was just in the movies or something. \nBernie holds her gaze her for a moment. \n", "test2_id": 928, "test3_input": "BERNIE Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a payment plan. Two years off the books at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. Five more days and I walk. \nBefore Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start to moan out loud. The waitress rushes over. \nPREGNANT GIRL (clutching her belly) Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor! \nThe young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. All this without paying the bill. \nAs they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips over Natalie's purse. Bernie quickly helps her up. That's when he notices the young man... \nBERNIE (shocked) Mikey? \nMIKEY Bernie... \nThere's a quick moment of confusion. Bernie feels a bit thrown by it all. \nEXT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY \nBernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step. \nOnce out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have subsided. Natalie walks with the girl to try and help. \nPREGNANT GIRL I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks. \nBernie pulls Mikey aside. \nBERNIE Mikey? Is that...? You're not the... \nMIKEY (nods) Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs in the family. I guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie. \nThey reach the couple's car. A rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine. By the looks of it, they've been living out of it. \nBERNIE This you? \nMIKEY Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, we gotta be somewhere... \nBERNIE How's your mom doing? \nMIKEY I'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you, she's getting by. As long as she's wasted. \nBernie nods. He gazes past Mikey to the girl. \nMIKEY Name's Charlene, in case you were wondering. Looks like she's carrying a whole litter in there, don't it? \nNATALIE When was the last time you saw a doctor? \nCharlene sidles up alongside Mikey. \nCHARLENE This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six months ago. I wasn't about to go back after they treated me like cattle. Just because I didn't have no insurance. And those places, they're crawling with T.B. from all 'em spies. \nBERNIE So, you're in town...? \nMIKEY Maybe a week or so. Got some business to take care of. \nBERNIE If you want, stop by the Lucky Star Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. I'm on three to eleven shift at the Shangri-la. I work the floor. \nMIKEY No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, maybe I'll do that. We can play catch up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split. \nNATALIE (to Charlene) Take care. \nMikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat. They drive off. Natalie looks to Bernie. She's curious, but doesn't ask. He appears thankful for that. \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the felt. We see the owner of the chips strike a match. His last one. It fizzles out quickly. TILT UP to the PLAYER'S FACE with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips. \n", "test3_true": "PULL BACK to reveal Bernie. \nPLAYER Thanks... \nBERNIE Don't mention it. \nBernie sits at the table. \nDEALER (he knows the routine) Hundred dollar minimum here, sir. \nBernie peels off a hundred from his billfold. Lays it on the felt. \nDEALER Money plays one hundred. \nPLAYER (to Bernie) No offense, pal, but there's twenty other tables. What do you wanna come sit on my head for? \nBERNIE Just wanna play one hand. Feeling lucky tonight. I got this voice in my head, says this is the table... \nPLAYER I know this is the table. I'm already doing good here. It's my fucking table -- \nBERNIE (touching him) Hey, heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says, \"Hey, who owns that big great dane outside?\" A man at the end of the bar raises his hand. \"I do.\" The fella says, \"Yeah? Well, my dog just killed it.\" \nThe dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal. \nBERNIE \"Whaddya mean your dog just killed my great dane? What kinda dog you have?\" The fella just shrugs and says, \"A chihuahua.\" \"You tellin' me your chihuahua just killed my great dane? How?\" (a beat) \"I dunno,\" the fella says, \"I think he got stuck in his throat.\" \nBernie starts laughing. The player is less than tickled. \nJust then the dealer interrupts them. \nDEALER Insurance? \nWe see the dealer's got an ace showing. \nPLAYER God damnit! \nThe player waves off the insurance, as does Bernie. The dealer checks. Nothing. As the hand plays through the dealer busts out. Bernie glances over at the dealer. What the hell? Bernie places his chips again. \nPLAYER You said, one hand. \nBERNIE (agitated; to dealer) Keep going. \nThe dealer plays. Bernie and the high roller win again. \nBernie glances around him uncomfortably. We see Shelly approaching. Shelly just has a nose for when things aren't running smoothly. Larry is lurking behind him. \nThe dealer turns up some cards. And again, Bernie and the high roller win. Bernie looks absolutely perturbed. Shelly gestures something with his head. Bernie cashes out. \nPLAYER Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, we make a great team. \nBernie strolls over to Shelly. Shelly guides him away from the table under Larry's watchful eye. \nSHELLY What was that? \nBernie shrugs, still confused. \nSHELLY Well, what fucking gives? Is it McGann? He's been with us twelve years. The man's as standup as my dick. (thinking to himself) Maybe he's got money problems. I'm gonna pull him. He wasn't counting 'em, was he? The mook with the streak? \nBernie shakes his head. Larry sidles over. \nLARRY Is there a problem? \nSHELLY (zero tolerance) No, there's no problem. Fella's on a streak, is all. \n", "test3_id": 929}

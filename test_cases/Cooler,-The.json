{"train": "It's in their reactions. A slight hesitation of the dice. \nFingers tensing over a pile of chips. A hand tugging at a tie. \nThe Cooler has arrived. \nAs he reaches table eleven, Natalie intercepts him with a short glass of Chivas Regal. \nNATALIE This is you, right? \nBERNIE (takes it from her) Thanks. \nNATALIE Joe said I should stick around. You say something to Shelly? \nBernie just smiles at her. \nNATALIE Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks. \nShe offers up a smile. It jump-starts those dormant eyes. \nHer whole face comes alive. Notches her up from an eight to a ten. Bernie immediately glances away. He's afraid what she might read in his gaze. \nBERNIE Don't mention it. \nBernie gestures her over to table eleven. Immediately makes the HIGH ROLLER in question. A good old boy named BULLDOG. \nHe's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one hand. \nBULLDOG I'll make you a fortune on five and nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three fifty-four! \nBernie grabs the drink from Natalie's tray, intentionally bumps Bulldog... \nBERNIE Hey, buddy, is this your drink? \nBULLDOG Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here. \nAnother man gladly accepts the drink. Meanwhile, Bulldog sends the dice high up into the air. They drop perfectly on the table. The stickman calls it. \nSTICKMAN Seven out! \nBULLDOG Mother-fucker! \nSTICKMAN Thank you for those bets, folks. \nThe croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table. \nBernie moves on quietly before anyone notices. \nBut he's been noticed all right. By Natalie. Not quite sure what she's just witnessed. Who is this guy? \nWe hear a VOICE over the intercom. \nVOICE (V.O.) Conway, party of twelve, please check your reservation at the Paradise Lounge. \nBernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker. \nBERNIE (to himself) Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASINO FLOOR CRAPS TABLE - MONTAGE - NIGHT \nA -- a player makes a hard six at a craps table. The players howl... \nB -- from the same angle we PAN UP from losing dice to the same guy. Bernie looming large in the background. \nSHELLY Revitalize? What are you talking about? We did thirty-five million last year. \nNicky shoots a look over at Larry and Marty. Larry takes this as his cue. \nLARRY First off, Shelly, I want you to know, I have nothing but respect for you. You've done a fantastic job with the Shangri-la for the last sixteen years. No one would dispute that. \nNICKY Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly. \nShelly nods carefully. But... \nLARRY But, the business has changed out here. You just have to take a look at the Strip to see what I'm talking about. \nSHELLY You mean, that amusement park mook fest out there? You know what that is? That's a fucking violation of something that used to be beautiful. That used to have class. Like a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele. And then that Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way. \nNicky and Larry exchange looks. Marty drops his gaze into his lap. \nSHELLY Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat whore hiding behind too much makeup. I look at her and see all those ugly stretch marks and I want to cry. 'Cause I remember her as she was. \nLARRY Yes, well... there's no denying the bottom line. Those eyesores are raking it in. And we can't compete against that. \nSHELLY What? You think I'm trying to compete with that? You think this joint's about bringing in the stroller crowd? Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride, looking to break the house on red and black. Fremont's never been about that bullshit. This is where old time and real money comes to play. \nLARRY The numbers, they don't back you up, Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all love nostalgia -- but it belongs in a museum. I think it's time to decide whether you're running a museum or a casino. \nShelly is close to losing it. He catches himself, takes a breath. \nNICKY Hey, forget about it. We'll talk later. Over dinner. \nMARTY (rubs his hands together) So, how's the action? \nLarry shoots him a disapproving look. Off Shelly's disturbed expression. He's already calculating serious damage control. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nBernie makes his way across the casino floor, when he's intercepted by Shelly. \nSHELLY Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment? \nBERNIE I was just heading over to -- \nSHELLY It can wait. \nShelly escorts Bernie over to a nearby bar area. The BARTENDER zips over with some drinks. \nSHELLY How's the knee? \nBernie shrugs. Natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away. \nPuts in a drink order. She catches Bernie's eye. Nods. \nBernie smiles. \nSHELLY I was speaking to this orthopedic surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He tells me they can replace a man's entire kneecap with titanium. It's the kinda thing that costs a shitload, but since the man's into us for five hundred large, I'm sure we could -- \nBERNIE (stealing glances at Natalie) I told you, I'm not gonna be around after Sunday. \nSHELLY (sighs) Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where the fuck are you gonna go that's better'n here? I got you covered in this town. People, they know you work for me, that's currency in your pocket. That's fuckin' respect when you walk the floor. Where you gonna get that anyplace else? \nBERNIE (sighs) Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and I'm out from under. \nA beautiful WOMAN in a low cut dress, sashays her way past them, heading for a high rollers craps table. Shelly reaches out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm. Hands her his card. She snatches it, looks it over. Immediately loses all attitude. \nOh shit. \nSHELLY That's right. I like to know who's shopping it in my neighborhood. You wanna keep working the Shangri-la, you come see me tomorrow morning in my office. We'll go over the rules together. And before you come, you bring me a clean bill of health. OK? \nNatalie shudders in disgust. She spins around to leave... runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him. \nNATALIE Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz. \nBernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces. \nBERNIE It's all right. Happens. \nNatalie tries to wipe him down a bit more. \nNATALIE Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, you know... \nBERNIE S'okay. You might want to stick around. \nBernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton. He gives the stickman a certain look. \nSTICKMAN Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have no hard eight. \nPINKERTON (throwing in a chip) Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight. \nBernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice. \nSTICKMAN Eight the hard way! \nThe players go nuts. The stickman taps the felt in front of the shooter. \nSTICKMAN Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton. \nPINKERTON Parlay! Parlay! \nThe Boxman seated at the center looks up at him. \nPINKERTON C'mon. You can take that action. \nThe Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval. \nPINKERTON That's what I'm talking about. None of this low limit bullshit. \nJust as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips a dollar chip over toward the center of the table. Natalie peers between them to catch a glimpse. \nBERNIE Dollar hard eight. \nThe chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet. He releases the dice from his stubby little fingers. \nSTICKMAN Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight comes down. \nThe players cry out in defeat. Pinkerton grumbles to himself. He fingers his rail of chips. \nPINKERTON Five hundred dollar hard eight. And press my nine up two units. \nHe throws in the chips. The croupier places his bets. The dice are fed back to him. He throws. \nSTICKMAN Easy way eight! Eight easy! \nPinkerton is fit to be tied. After a passing moment of clarity he empties his entire rail. \nPINKERTON Hard eight. \nThe entire table stops down for a second. \nPLAYER (O.S.) Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm. \nPinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly. \nSTICKMAN Seven out! \nBUDDY Whassimatter, kid? You got that Nostradamus look. \nShelly shakes his head. \nBUDDY You ever watch those nature shows on TV? \nShelly shakes his head. \nBUDDY I've seen this one a dozen times. It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. The leader of the pack... \nSHELLY Pride. It's called a pride. \nBUDDY Yeah, pride. The leader of the pride... when he gets on in years. It's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him. They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him. It's humiliating. In front of all the females, this goes down. And after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush. \nSHELLY Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense of humor. \nBUDDY No shit. It's fucking tragic because the old lion can't figure it out on his own. That he's past it. It'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation. \nSHELLY That's like admitting to yourself that you're already dead. I prefer nature's way. \nBUDDY (a beat) Yeah. Me, too. \nShelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror. \nINT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT \nShelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on him. \nHe's accompanied by a good looking YOUNG MAN. \nLARRY Shelly, got a minute... \nShelly's expression: no. But he heads over anyway. \nLARRY Shelly, this is Johnny Capella. \nJOHNNY How ya doin', Shelly? \nJohnny extends his hand. Shelly ignores the gesture. \nSHELLY I know you from somewhere, right? \nLARRY Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage. Sony's talking about signing him to a three album deal. They're positioning him as the new Ricki Martin. \nSHELLY And I should be interested in this, why? \nLARRY Johnny's looking to headline. I told him we might be interested. \nSHELLY (icy) We? \nJOHNNY Hey, if this is a bad time... \nSHELLY Even if I were interested, Buddy's got ink with us through 2003. I just renegotiated his contract last year. \nJOHNNY Sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page. (to Larry) If I don't hear from you by Thursday, I'm taking the Stardust's offer. \nJohnny nods at Shelly, takes off. Shelly and Larry eyeball each other for a long, cold beat. Shelly's about to say something, when Nicky and Marty approach. Larry shrugs, flashes a chilling smile. \nNICKY Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old fart a drink. \nSHELLY Buddy asked me to send you his regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so great. I think he's got that stomach flu that's going around. \nNICKY Oh yeah? That's too bad. (Shelly isn't fooling him) Well, another time then. \nMARTY Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls. Something with class. \nBERNIE (not even sure why he's telling her this) I only got six more days. Well, almost five really. Then I'll be leaving town. \nNATALIE Only five more days? (a beat) Then we shouldn't waste any more time. \nNatalie covers Bernie's hand with hers. \nNATALIE Why don't we go back to your place? \nBERNIE (completely caught off-guard) I, uh... If this is... I don't know... I don't know if I can afford... \nNatalie flinches slightly. Then swiftly regains her composure. It's Vegas. An honest mistake. \nBERNIE Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't mean... You see -- that's exactly what I'm talking about. I've gone and \"cooled\" the damn table. \nNATALIE Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't gone and cooled anything. Not by a long shot. \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nNatalie's hand flips on the television. Another bizarre religious service. We pull back from the screen as she tries to change the channel. Just gets a whole lot of static. \nBernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. \nNATALIE You should complain about this. \nBERNIE I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, all I got's gin. \nNATALIE Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead. \nBernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot. \nNatalie glances around. She notices Bernie's dead plants... \nNATALIE You know, once they're dead, they don't really grow back. In case, that's what you're waiting for. \nHer eyes land on the empty cat bowl. She's about to say something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression. Let's not even go there. She gestures to an old record player in the corner. \nNATALIE So... got any music? \nBernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. Bare shelves... except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's a Sinatra album. Never been opened. \nNatalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon. \nNatalie can't help but smile. \nBernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record. \nEverything seems to be going so well, until... \nSKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard. \nBernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious laugh comes out. \nIt's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing \"This Town,\" a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch. \nNatalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger. He picks up his glass, shuffles over. \nNATALIE Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least one of us has done this before. \nBERNIE This is not my first -- \nNATALIE Sssh. Surprise me. \nShe starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary moans from him. Bernie is almost in tears. Nobody's touched him like this in years. And it shows. \nNatalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, then sets it on the floor. She drops down next to Bernie. \nBERNIE Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a payment plan. Two years off the books at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. Five more days and I walk. \nBefore Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start to moan out loud. The waitress rushes over. \nPREGNANT GIRL (clutching her belly) Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor! \nThe young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. All this without paying the bill. \nAs they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips over Natalie's purse. Bernie quickly helps her up. That's when he notices the young man... \nBERNIE (shocked) Mikey? \nMIKEY Bernie... \nThere's a quick moment of confusion. Bernie feels a bit thrown by it all. \nEXT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY \nBernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step. \nOnce out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have subsided. Natalie walks with the girl to try and help. \nPREGNANT GIRL I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks. \nBernie pulls Mikey aside. \nBERNIE Mikey? Is that...? You're not the... \nMIKEY (nods) Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs in the family. I guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie. \nThey reach the couple's car. A rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine. By the looks of it, they've been living out of it. \nBERNIE This you? \nMIKEY Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, we gotta be somewhere... \nBERNIE How's your mom doing? \nMIKEY I'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you, she's getting by. As long as she's wasted. \nBernie nods. He gazes past Mikey to the girl. \nMIKEY Name's Charlene, in case you were wondering. Looks like she's carrying a whole litter in there, don't it? \nNATALIE When was the last time you saw a doctor? \nCharlene sidles up alongside Mikey. \nCHARLENE This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six months ago. I wasn't about to go back after they treated me like cattle. Just because I didn't have no insurance. And those places, they're crawling with T.B. from all 'em spies. \nBERNIE So, you're in town...? \nMIKEY Maybe a week or so. Got some business to take care of. \nBERNIE If you want, stop by the Lucky Star Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. I'm on three to eleven shift at the Shangri-la. I work the floor. \nMIKEY No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, maybe I'll do that. We can play catch up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split. \nNATALIE (to Charlene) Take care. \nMikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat. They drive off. Natalie looks to Bernie. She's curious, but doesn't ask. He appears thankful for that. \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the felt. We see the owner of the chips strike a match. His last one. It fizzles out quickly. TILT UP to the PLAYER'S FACE with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips. \nLARRY (re: Bernie) Let me guess? This is one of your \"coolers?\" \nSHELLY Why don't you announce it to the whole fucking joint? \nLARRY (lowers his voice) Man, they told me you were a stickler for the old ways. But coolers? What is this guy, some kind of degenerate gambler? Reformed card shark? He doesn't look too effective to me. \nSHELLY He's the best. Take it from me. \nLARRY Sure. Whatever. But there ways -- subtle ways -- to keep things in our favor. I'm talking more forward thinking methods. \nSHELLY That right? I suppose you got a whole fucking prospectus on the subject. \nLARRY As a matter of fact I do. Like, right off the bat, I can tell you this wallpaper isn't going to cut it. It's too uplifting. I would go with more muted tones. \nSHELLY Yeah? Wallpaper? \nLARRY And personally, I think the waitresses can all pop another button or two. Myself, I wouldn't hire anything less than a C cup. \nShelly looks to Bernie. You believe this mook? Larry extracts a CD from his jacket... \nLARRY Know what this is? Music to be sure. Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra. \"Lose... lose... lose.\" And that's just skimming the surface. We really need to talk, Shelly. \nShelly is close to losing it. When MORRIE, the manager of the Paradise, comes running up... \nMORRIE Shelly, you better come quick. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nShelly, Larry and Bernie following behind Morrie as he hastily leads them down a hallway of the Shangri-la's best suites. They arrive at an open door, the sound of a TELEVISION beckoning them inside... \nINT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S SUITE - NIGHT \nStarting on the TV set: \"Lost Horizon\" (1937) is playing. \nIt's the scene where Robert Conway (Ronald Coleman), his brother and Maria are leaving the lost city in the end. \nConway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise. \nPANNING OFF THE SCREEN to a pair of naked feet on the floor next to the bed... revealing Buddy slumped against the side of the mattress... a hypodermic needle protruding from his arm. Death glaze fixated on the screen. \nBernie slumps back against the wall. Catches his breath. \nShelly just stares at Buddy, a slight tremor of grief threatening his granite features. He glances over at Larry, who takes in Buddy's deathly repose without a hint of emotion. Larry meets Shelly's eye with a subtle smirk of one-upmanship. \nAn incendiary beat passes between them. Then... \nSHELLY (to Morrie) Get a hold of his daughter. Assist her with the arrangements. The Shangri- la will take care of everything. \nMORRIE What about the Paradise? \nSHELLY She goes dark tonight. \nLARRY That won't be necessary. \nShelly and Larry exchange looks again. Bernie picks up on it. The tension in the room threatens nuclear fission. A loud ANIMAL ROAR reverberates on the soundtrack... \naccompanied by jungle-like percussion... as we CUT TO: \nINT. THE PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nA \"now performing\" poster on a metal stand: JOHNNY CAPPELLA live at the Paradise Lounge! \nPANNING off the sign and following a COUPLE through the doors into the theater. \n...our eye drawn to the stage. A troupe of gorgeous FEMALE DANCERS in leopard print G-strings, grinding their hips to the muscular rhythm. \nBERNIE You know, you don't have to tell me this. \nNATALIE I want to, Bernie. Better you know the worst of me up front. Later, when I'm already invested in you, it'll be too hard to come clean. After I tell you this, you'll probably... I mean, I'll understand. \nShe tears her eyes away from Bernie. Bernie can't believe what he's hearing. That she wants to be invested in him. \nWhat could be so bad? \nNATALIE I gave my son up for adoption. I just wanted my life back. I was seventeen going on eighteen and I was selfish. My family, they didn't want to have nothing to do with me after that. So I hitched a ride out here. Figured I could make it as a showgirl. Ten years later... (shrugs; starts to break up) I like to think that if it happened when I was older -- with some guy I cared about -- maybe things would have been different. I think about my Little Joe. And, I do know he's better off. I'm convinced of that. \nShe lowers her soda. Turns to Bernie. He studies her for a lengthy beat, stoic features. She wipes away her tears. Oh well, that's that. Bernie stands up. Looks around... focuses on the arcade clock. It reads 1:40 a.m. He turns to her... \nBERNIE So, you wanna go try your hand at the dime pitch? It's early still. \nOff Natalie's tear-filled features. She breaks into a laugh- cry... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBernie and Natalie making love. Slow, tender. Natalie doesn't make with the \"Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great\" encouragement. Just some low key moans. Bernie doesn't come too soon either. He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts. \nIn contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away through the walls. An escalating ostinato of \"Oh Baby's.\" \nUntil Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against the wall. Big smile from both of them. \nEXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY \nBernie and Natalie returning from breakfast in Bernie's Buick. Bernie can't find a parking spot. Natalie climbs out, heads for the room. \nNatalie arrives at the room. She's about to stab the key in the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar. She hesitates for a moment, then pushes it open... \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \n...to find Mikey and Charlene waiting on them. Charlene is puffing away on a Marlboro when Natalie enters. She immediately stubs it out. Rises, heads for the bathroom. \nCHARLENE I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing. \nShe closes the door after her. \nNATALIE (to Mikey) How did you get in here? \nMIKEY I told the desk clerk Bernie was my old man. He let us wait inside. That a problem? \nNATALIE Bernie's looking for a parking space. \nMIKEY (chuckles) Shit. I musta taken the last one. \nMikey steps up to Natalie. She hasn't moved from the doorway. Her dislike for Mikey is evident. \nMIKEY Tell me something, Natalie? Is he paying you? \nNATALIE Excuse me? \nMIKEY My old man, is he renting your ass? 'Cause otherwise I just don't get it. A loser like my pops in the company of some primo T & A. It don't compute. \nNatalie doesn't dignify Mikey with an answer. She stares him down unflinchingly. Mikey reaches out to Natalie's ear, \"pulls\" out a $20 dollar chip. \nMIKEY This enough to get me a taste? Family discount? \nHe drops the chip down Natalie's cleavage. Natalie still doesn't react. Mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face. \nShe flinches. Right then, the door swings open. Bernie enters. Mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand. He extends it to Natalie. She ignores the gesture, steps aside. \nBERNIE Mikey... \nSHELLY What's going on, Nicky? \nNICKY I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about this earlier... but the deal wasn't closed yet. \nMARTY Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna love it. \nNicky gestures to Larry. Larry whisks the plastic sheet off the table... \n...to reveal an impressive SCALE MODEL of a redesigned SHANGRI- LA HOTEL AND CASINO. \nThe model boasts huge snow-capped Himalayan peaks a la \"Lost Horizon,\" surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and casino. A Matterhorn-like rollercoaster traverses the mountain top. Gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise to raise the bar on Las Vegas opulence. We're looking at a hundred million dollar investment easy. \nNICKY The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino. We break ground on her in six months. \nOff Shelly's startled expression -- \nNICKY I know what you're thinking? Where's she gonna go? You need space to expand, right? Well, that's been taken care of. We're now the proud owners of The Golden Frontier next door. \nLARRY (gesturing to the model) She's perfect. Three floors of gaming, IMAX theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, you name it. She'll pay for herself in three years, and then it's easy money. \nNICKY Isn't she great, Shell? \nShelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner mounting the scaffolding. \nWe see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming pool. \nSHELLY In \"Lost Horizon,\" these people, their plane crashes in the Himalayas -- and they get rescued and taken to this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri- la. It's beautiful. The place is completely isolated. Untouched by the outside world. There's no war, no greed, no bullshit... Time is slowed down. People, they don't age. It's... paradise. That's what Shangri- la is. Paradise. \nLARRY Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And your point is? \nShelly whirls around, yells: \nSHELLY You don't fuck with paradise! All'a ya! \nNICKY Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not trying to fuck with it. We're trying to make it better. \nSHELLY How... how, Nicky, could it be any better? Right now it's perfect. It's the last of its kind. It's pure... and this. (points to the model; weary) ...this is just... it's a mockery. An insult. Trying to make something of it that it isn't. \nLARRY What are you talking about? It's right outta the movie? \nSHELLY Whose talking about a fuckin' movie? This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is my life. This is my house of worship. You people are shittin' on all that's sacred to me. \nA tense silence ensues. Nicky, Larry and Marty exchange looks. \nSHELLY (tired laugh) I got just one question? Where you gonna be when they decide to change it back? When the people, they come looking for the real Vegas, from before all this Epcott Center bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to them? You guys? I don't think so. You know who? The same fucks who started this shit in the first place. It's all gonna come full circle and bite you in the ass. Mark my words. \nShelly falls silent. Massages his forehead. Shit, that wasn't the way to handle it. \nNicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to Shelly, places a hand on his shoulder. Shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away. \nNICKY You make some good points, Shelly. Maybe it'll swing back the other way, who knows? But the smart money suggests we roll the dice. I'm not gonna bullshit you; naturally there's gonna be a lot of restructuring in the months to come, but I want you to know, you'll always have a place with us. \nSHELLY Where's that? Behind the bar? \nMARTY (laughs) Behind the bar, that's a good one. \nNICKY I think you should take some time and think things through. All this, it's a lot to digest, y'know. \nMARTY Speaking of things to digest, I'm starving. How's that buffet they got in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You recommend their prime rib, Shell? \nShelly stares right through Marty. Choke and die on it, motherfucker. \nSHELLY It's food. \nNICKY Hey, my arteries can use a workout. Lead us to the trough, Shell. \nThe players make their bets. \nSUBURBANITE Good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die, old man. \nNicky slowly starts his routine defiantly. \nSUBURBANITE Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another year older already. \nNicky throws. \nSTICKMAN OUT! Seven! Line away. \nNicky claps his hands dealer style -- for effect -- and with a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table. Nicky's chips are quickly swept up by the croupier. \nSUBURBANITE Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody craps out. \nNicky locks eyes with the suburbanite. Then flashes a smile that suggests he's going to brush it off. He turns away from the table... \nSUBURBANITE Now go change your fucking Depends. \nNicky makes like it's all in good jest. Yeah, that's real cute. He heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds out his hand as if to say: Hey, no hard feelings. The suburbanite shrugs. What the fuck? I was just playing with you, pops. He reaches for Nicky's hand... when Nicky suddenly headbutts him. Before anyone can react, Nicky starts laying into the suburbanite. The man goes down and. \nNicky continues pummeling him... \nNICKY Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no- dick, suburbanite scum. How's that for a game?! \nShelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table. He takes immediate control of the situation. Snaps his fingers at security. The suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful of comps and a bruised ego. Shelly takes Nicky aside, attempts to calm him. Nicky keeps railing at Shelly: \nNICKY That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks up my game like that. Who the fuck does he think he is? \nSHELLY You're right. He's just a piece of shit. Forget about him. \nNICKY I thought this joint had more class. Used to be, we wouldn't even let bums like that in... \nNicky catches himself. He looks at Shelly for a beat. \nThere's an unspoken understanding between them. \"The good old days.\" We see Bernie in the b.g., looking more than a bit shocked. \nINT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT \nBernie seated with Natalie. \nBERNIE This town... You know, Natalie, all I want to do is go some place where I can tell day from night. Where they got clocks on the wall. I can't breathe around here no more. Four days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure I can hold out that long. \nNATALIE (a beat) So where does that leave us? \nBERNIE A week ago, I didn't remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me. I'm still pinching myself, expecting to wake-up from... (just blurts it out) Come with me, Natalie. I want you to come with me. \nNATALIE God, Bernie, that's... \nBERNIE I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring that on you. \nNATALIE Bernie... I want to be with you. I do. But I don't know if I can leave with you. \nBernie's look: Why? \nNATALIE I was working on a compatibility chart for the two of us. And it looks good, really, it does. \nBERNIE So, what's the problem? \nNATALIE That's with us here. In Vegas. \nBernie's expression: Oh. \nNATALIE Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause I knew you were leaving... and I tried working it in different ways... It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared. But that's just for now, for the immediate future. Once the planets realign, maybe a year from now... \nCHARLENE Come on all you's. Put a good thought in for our baby! \nAs everyone dotes over Charlene, Mikey quickly swaps the dice before anyone can see. He throws. \nSTICKMAN Six the hard way! \nMikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is Charlene. \nBernie stands frozen. He doesn't bother trying to get any closer to the table. He knows it'll do no good. \nCHARLENE Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He knows. He knows you're all pulling for him. God bless you all. \nNatalie looks over at Charlene. Their eyes meet for a second. It's as though Natalie knows it's a scam and Charlene's acknowledging it. \nMikey throws again. \nSTICKMAN Six the hard way! Look out, we got a shooter! \nAnother nine grand. Mikey's rail is nearly full. Charlene hops around awkwardly causing more distraction. \nBernie is really sweating it out now. Then Shelly arrives. \nLarry is hot on his tail. \nSHELLY How much? \nBERNIE Eighteen thousand since I stepped up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've been hit and miss lately. \nShelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure. Something definitely isn't kosher. \nAs Charlene chatters on, Mikey switches the dice back. \nShelly makes him. \nSHELLY (sotto) Fucking amateurs... \nMikey throws... \nSTICKMAN Seven out! Line away. \nThe players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud Mikey's achievement. \nMIKEY (bowing) I thank you. My wife thanks you. My unborn child thanks you. \nMikey moves his rail of chips to the felt. \nMIKEY Color me up will ya? \nLarry notices Shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves. \nLARRY You've gotta be kidding me. (off Shelly's steely glare) That's not how I propose we handle it. We'll turn the matter over to the authorities. They'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined... \nSHELLY (gets in Larry's face) And then we'll give 'em both a lollipop for the ride home. Come watch and learn, Harvard. A little lesson on how to protect your investment -- the old school way. \nShelly walks over to Mikey and Charlene, Larry lingering behind him. \nSHELLY Hey, that was some run you had back there. \nMIKEY Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess. \nMikey steals a tense glance at Charlene. She starts to fidget nervously. \nSHELLY Why don't we go do this in my office? I don't like to hand out all this amount of cash on the floor. \nSecurity (Tony and Lou) corrals the couple. Leads them away. \nCHARLENE Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me to the hospital... contractions... \nBERNIE Shelly, please help her. That's my grandson... \nSHELLY Hey, why don't we all break out the champagne? Lootz is about to become a granddaddy. (walks over to her) How you doin' there, sweetheart? Must hurt like crap, huh? \nCHARLENE (nods) Hurts so bad... \nSHELLY Yeah? \nSuddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly! WHAM! She screeches out. \nNATALIE Oh God... \nBERNIE Jesus NOOOOO!!! \nEven Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. Larry is aghast. Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows on him. Shelly swats him off. He drops down next to the squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her stomach... \n...to reveal a mound of fake padding. He tears the padding away from her, throws it at Bernie. \nSHELLY Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got a cigar? \nThe muscle start laughing it up. Relief. Larry emits a nervous giggle. Natalie's jaw hits the floor. Bernie takes a step back. He's about to go into serious shock. Charlene curls over, sobbing. \nSHELLY (to Bernie) You sure you still want to be good for it? Because if you want to change your mind, I don't blame you. \nBernie looks over at Mikey. He stares up at his father, trembling. \nMIKEY I'll make it up to you, Pop, I swear... \nBernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. He's almost tempted to... He just shrugs and nods at Shelly. \nBERNIE It's on me. \nSHELLY (shakes his head) That's the worst fucking call you ever made in your life. \nON NATALIE at that moment. We can tell she agrees with Shelly... but thinks all the more of Bernie for it. That might even be love in her eyes. \nShelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. Walks over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing Mikey's left kneecap. Oh man, the scream... \nBERNIE What are you doing?! I thought we had -- \nSHELLY 150 G's buys their lives. This is just a little slap on the wrist to remember me by. \nNatalie turns her head. She's about to throw up. Larry watches, unflinchingly. Charlene is making with some serious pleading now. \nCHARLENE Oh god... it wasn't my idea. \nShelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in the palm of his hand. He smiles reassuringly at her. \nSHELLY You know, motherhood is a beautiful thing. This... you made a mockery out of it. Maybe you'll get to experience it for real one day. \nCHARLENE (nods, sobbing) I want... to be a mother... please don't hurt me... \nSHELLY I'm not going to hurt you. \nShelly turns his back on her. Charlene starts sobbing relief. They're not going to hurt her. It's going to be all right. Wrong. Shelly throws the bat to Lou. The heavy steps up to the plate (as we RACK FOCUS to Shelly walking away) -- CRUNCH!!! followed by the girl's SHRIEKS. Natalie buries her head in Bernie's shoulder. \nSHELLY (to Tony and Lou) Get 'em outta here. You ever see them in this joint again, kill 'em. \nSHELLY (to Bernie and Natalie) You two, you're still on shift. \nShelly catches Larry's eye: I hope you were taking notes. \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nHe glances over his shoulder... No Natalie. Just her impression in the sheets. And a note on her pillow. For a moment his heart stops. He conjures up the worst. Grabs up the note, unfolds it. \nWe see a lipstick kiss and the words: HAVE A SPECTACULAR DAY! \nBernie lets out a joyful whoop! Leaps out of bed... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nCLOSE-UP: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl. We hear the record player needle drop on \"Luck Be A Lady.\" Cut to: \nBernie's feet gliding around the room... PAN UP to Bernie dancing with himself. He's positively aglow. He snatches up a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra. It's true -- love makes the world go around. It obviously also gives life to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung up overnight above his radiator. But we won't dwell on that. \nINT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - DAY \nBernie struts into the casino a changed man (still to the tune of \"Luck Be a Lady\"). Even his limp seems less pronounced as he greets fellow workers as they pass. \nHe catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror. Maybe for the first time, he likes what he sees. In the reflection he notices Natalie smiling at him. He meets her eyes. She averts them quickly, keeps walking. \nINT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT \nShelly watches Bernie from the video monitor. He appears less than delighted over Bernie's sunny disposition. He picks up the phone, dials. \nSHELLY (into phone) Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to crap table six. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nPer usual, Bernie walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee. Doris slides it over. \nBERNIE (looking around) Got any cre -- \nBefore he can answer, Doris hands him a container of cream. \nA full container. Taken aback, he starts pouring it into his cup, when he hears a VOICE over the intercom: \nVOICE (V.O.) Lovett, party of six, your table is ready, Lovett, party of six. \nBernie looks to Doris. \nBERNIE Duty calls. \nINT. CASINO - MONTAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nA -- Bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just in time for the dealer to bust out. The crowd goes crazy! \nB -- Bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of a slot machine. Suddenly, the woman playing it hits a jackpot. \nC -- Everywhere he seems to go, people continue to win. \nD -- Bernie, despite the spooky irony, can't help but smile as mountains of chips pile up on the tables. Shelly appears behind him. Not a happy camper. He gestures Bernie to follow him. \nINT. CASINO SLOTS AREA - NIGHT \nThey head over to a section of slots. As they pass one of those huge million dollar slots, the FLOOR MANAGER cuts in front of them. \nFLOOR MANAGER Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, 'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure, once in a while she'll flash you a bit of tit, but your chances of hitting a home run -- one in twenty million. Here, give her a shot... \nHe hands Shelly a cup of quarters, takes off. Shelly looks to Bernie. He's trying to keep a lid on his anger. \nSHELLY (feeding Marnie quarters) You wanna tell me what's going on out there? \nBERNIE I don't know... \nShelly pulls the lever. \nINT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - NIGHT \nBernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off duty. \nBERNIE Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? I'm supposed to give her a ride home. \nCOCKTAIL WAITRESS #1 I think she left already. She wasn't feelin' too good. We been covering for her. \nOff Bernie's expression: Oh... \nEXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT \nBernie's Buick pulls into the lot. He parks, heads for his room. \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBernie enters. Flips on the light. No Natalie. \nBERNIE (calls to the bathroom) Natalie? You in there? \nNo answer. He heads over. Finds it empty. Concern spreads across his features. He glances around the room. Notices the closet wide open. Natalie's clothes missing. \nBERNIE (sotto) Natalie. \nThat's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser mirror. He rushes over, rips it off. \nI'M SORRY BERNIE. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T IN THE CARDS FOR US. TAKE CARE, NATALIE. \nBernie slumps to the floor in disbelief. Starts to tremble. \nThen rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs. Christ, make it stop hurting... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER \nBernie seated at the foot of the bed, drinking bourbon from a solitary glass. He's almost gone through an entire bottle. \nHe glances down, notices a pair of Natalie's stockings sticking out from under the bed. He brings them up to his face. Breathes her in, only to exhale a sorry breath. \nINT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - BAR - NIGHT \nBernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee. Doris starts to pour the cream... whoops... empty. Bernie shrugs. Par for the course. Time to go to work. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nWe see Bernie back in top form. Forget Mr. Cool, he's turned into Mr. Freeze with a vengeance. The high rollers are facing a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to Bernie. \nSERIES \nA -- A man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full of hubris. Bernie pulls up a chair next to him. \nB -- We see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps table. The cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are flung. Players groan as they jettison the table, leaving just Bernie... \nC -- We see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players sit with twelves and thirteens. They sit stunned as their money is swept away. The same man with the hefty bankroll unclips the last of his green. He throws it over to the dealer to change in. \nD -- Larry, roaming the floor, is visibly disturbed by Bernie's cooling ability. It's something he can't quantify and it unsettles him. He glances up toward Shelly's observation window, knows the man is gloating. \nGood call. From behind the glass, Shelly lights up a stogey. Hint of a smile. You go, Bernie. \nINT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nJohnny Cappella rocks the house. PAN ACROSS to Shelly and Bernie seated in Shelly's booth. Shelly is in a jovial mood, while Bernie is a portrait of misery. \nBERNIE I want you to tell me the truth, Shelly. Did you say something to Natalie? Did you muscle her -- \nWhich only seems to make it worse, as Bernie's presence spurs the player on to an even bigger win. \nBernie has that goofy \"my heart is full\" look about him. \nWhich can mean only one thing in Shelly's book. The man looks about ready to split an atom. We see Larry hovering nearby with a smug grin. Off of Shelly's enraged expression... \nEXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY \nLou's black Oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot. Shelly and the boys climb out, head for... \nEXT. THE MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY \nNatalie's sunning herself at the pool. The only other people around are a middle-aged couple and a young boy. \nShelly (slipping on his leather gloves), followed by Lou and Tony, strides purposefully up to Natalie -- no hellos, nothing -- just grabs her by the hair... \nNATALIE Hey! Ouch! What are you...? \nHe drags Natalie over to Bernie's room, kicks the door open, shoves Natalie inside... \nINT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nShelly throws Natalie onto the bed. Lou closes the door and draws the blinds. \nNATALIE You got no fucking right...! \nSHELLY What did I tell you?! What did I fuckin' tell you?! \nNATALIE I tried... I couldn't... \nSHELLY I don't give a fuck! \nShelly heads over to the closet, rips it open, pulls out a suitcase. He starts throwing Natalie's clothes into the case. \nSHELLY You're gone, sweetheart. History. Kiss paradise goodbye. \nNATALIE (hysterical) I can't leave! I won't! I love him. Doesn't that mean anything to you, you heartless fuck? \nShelly stops packing. He grabs Natalie up off the bed, starts smacking her around. \nSHELLY Who the fuck do you think you are? You ain't nobody! I could make you disappear like this... (snaps his fingers) And nobody would ever notice you were gone. Nobody! \nNATALIE (yells) Bernie would! I got friends! You don't fuckin' own me. You got no right -- \nShelly lifts Natalie up, throws her across the room into the dresser mirror. SMASH! She crumbles to the floor, glass showering her. Natalie grabs up a shard, rushes Shelly with it... \nNATALIE Fuck you! \nShe slashes Shelly across the arm. Ouch, fuck! Before Tony and Lou can make a move, Shelly ensnares her wrist -- snaps it backwards -- AARRRRGGHHH!!! Shelly snatches up the shard, shoves her back on the bed. We see her terror reflected in the jagged glass against her cheek... \nSHELLY You fuckin' cunt... \nHe slices her cheek open. \nTony and Lou look on with mutual expressions: Shelly's getting a little carried away here. \nShelly staggers to his feet... \nSHELLY You think that's bad? That's just a taste, bitch. You're still here when Bernie gets home and I'll finish the job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin' pieces, the vultures'll be trading on you for a month. \nShelly reaches into his jacket, pulls out a wad of bills. \nThrows them at Natalie. \nSHELLY Here... go get yourself some cosmetic surgery. \nShelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable. He looks pre-occupied. Almost melancholic. Bernie's assessment of his life having hit home. \nSuddenly the door is thrown open. It's Tony... \nTONY Shelly, take a look at number 4. \nINT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - MOMENTS LATER \nShelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the crowd. He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get a closer look. \nSHELLY (to the boxman) How much is he up? \nThe boxman looks up nervously. \nBOXMAN Around three hundred thousand. \nShelly mouths the words under his breath. \nSHELLY Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses call me? \nBOXMAN We tried. You weren't picking up. Besides, it was Bernie. \nThe game resumes. \nSTICKMAN Alright. We're coming out folks, hands high... \nBernie stops. \nBERNIE Wait! \nEverybody quiets down to listen. \nBERNIE Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. (beat) And give it to him. \nBernie points to Shelly standing in the pit. The crowd watches the drama play out. \nBERNIE That's what I owe you, Shelly. There it is. We're square. (to the table) Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives up to his obligations. \nThe boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays them out on the table. He counts it and claps his hands together for the cameras. \nBOXMAN One hundred fifty thousand, coming in. \nShelly stands motionless. Staring into Bernie's eyes. The whole crowd watches. After what seems like an eternity, Shelly nods. Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others. A moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone. \nLarry appears next to Shelly. Nicky and Marty watching from the sidelines -- dour expressions. \nLARRY What's the matter with you? He's one of ours and he's taking us to the fucking cleaners. \nSHELLY Lootz's off the clock. As long as he's off the clock, he's free to play. Just like every other schmuck in this joint. \nLARRY It smells wrong. I'm shutting him down. He's not leaving here with a dime -- \nShelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of his fingers. Larry gasps, starts to cave. Shelly keeps him upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. Nicky and Marty looking on in amazement. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe door flies open, Larry catapults into frame. OOF! \nBounces off the wall. Shelly's right behind him. He drags Larry to his feet. Slams him into the wall again -- gets right up in his face. \nSHELLY Now you listen real good, you Harvard turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He leaves here tonight with whatever he comes out with. You so much as touch a hair on his head and I'll fucking wallpaper this joint with your ass. Muted tones, right? (slams him hard) What's that? I don't hear nothing. Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear it. \nBlended in at a subsonic level. \nSome kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain. \nHe doesn't answer. Just starts up the car... \nINT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nOn the surveillance monitors: the epidemic continues -- players winning at every table. The Shangri-la's been wiped out. There's no way they can cover this amount of winning action. \nPANNING ACROSS to Shelly. Defeated. The phone rings incessantly in the b.g. Shelly ignores it. \nLou pokes his head into the office: \nLOU Want me to get that, Shelly? \nShelly doesn't respond. He reaches into his desk drawer for that bottle and a glass. Is about to pour himself a shot... \nFuck it. Pushes the glass aside. Takes it straight from the bottle. The phone keeps ringing... \nOn the scale model of the newly proposed Shangri-la. Hold on it. \nWHAM! A chair enters frame, shatters \"paradise.\" \nWIDER: Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance. Kicking the debris around the office. \nDrenched in sweat, Shelly staggers over to his desk. Swats the empty gin bottle to the floor. Picks up his disinfectant spray, gives his desk one last wipedown. Immaculate. \nStands, walks out... \nINT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nWe see the lights of the city receding in Bernie's rearview mirror. Once outside of the city limits Bernie pulls the car over. \nNATALIE What are you stopping for? \nBernie throws open his door... \nBERNIE I think I'm gonna... \nThrow up. And he does. It's as if he's choking up the entire city. Everything that's bad about it. Finally, he pulls himself back into the car. Slams the door. \nNatalie touches his cheek, a reassuring look in her eyes. \nSuddenly, he's smiling. He opens his coat and a huge wad of cash tumbles out. He throws it up into the air. Natalie almost chokes with surprise. \nBERNIE Bahamas, here we come, baby. \nShe throws her arms around him... \nSuddenly an EXPLOSION OF LIGHT! A flashlight. In the hand of a MOTORCYCLE COP. He raps on the window... \nCOP Step out of the car please. \nBERNIE (lowers the window) What's the problem, officer? \nThe cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering the car interior. \nCOP Just step out of the car, please. Both of you. \nBernie and Natalie exchange unsettled looks. The cop lowers his hand to his gun. Bernie nods at Natalie. They climb out. He directs them off to the side. Shines his light in their faces. \nBERNIE If my driving... if I was going a little fast -- I was just over excited, officer. See, we just had a big win at the Shangri-la -- \nCOP You didn't win nothing. \nThe cop pulls out his revolver, trains it on them. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n", "test1_input": "THE COOLER \nWritten by \nFrank Hannah & Wayne Kramer \nEXT. STYGIAN DARKNESS - NIGHT \nSTYGIAN DARKNESS \nThe suggestion of traveling through space. Suddenly a star sparkles to life in the distance. Gives rise to another... and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars. No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS. A throbbing skyline of neon. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. As seen from a descending aerial shot. We PLUNGE down into her shimmering embrace... DISSOLVING TO: \nEXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT \nCruising the Strip, taking in modern day Las Vegas. Sin City gone theme park. Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: THE MGM GRAND... EXCALIBUR... LUXOR... TREASURE ISLAND... passing revamped faithfuls like CAESARS and THE DESERT INN... \n...then heading DOWNTOWN to Fremont Street, where \"old school\" Vegas makes its last stand. BINION'S HORSESHOE, THE FOUR QUEENS, THE LAS VEGAS CLUB arid... \nTHE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO \nOne thing's for sure. This place ain't no bastard child of Epcott Center. At least, not yet. Sure there's some flash going on, but it's more class than overkill. \nThis is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. A joint where every dealer knows your name. Where part of the allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper of worn felt. Where \"funny business\" doesn't just get you blacklisted... It gets you dead. \nLets us enter. \nINT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT \nCREDITS SEQUENCE \nTRACKING through the casino floor; highlighting SLOT MACHINE PAY-OFFS and pockets of rowdy players winning at BLACKJACK, CRAPS and ROULETTE. It's just one of those nights. The tables are on fire. \nA FLOOR MANAGER nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter at a craps table: He checks out his watch, anxious for the arrival of... \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nFrom behind a FIGURE in a suit. All we see is a murky reflection in gold elevator doors. The floor numbers descending rapidly... \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nSTICKMEN, CROUPIERS, DEALERS \nall anticipating the arrival of... \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors open... and we PAN DOWN to the figure's feet. He steps out onto the casino floor... and right away we notice he has a pronounced limp. \nFollowing behind the figure. We haven't seen his features yet... (and won't for a while.) \nTRACKING SERIES \u0097 \n-- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a ROULETTE TABLE, the wheel already in mid-spin. His hand casually brushes the side of the table... and we PAN ACROSS to the wheel -- just in time to see the ball landing on 00. The players HOWL defeat. The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a slight nod of respect to the passing wraith... \n-- TRACKING PAST SOME BLACKJACK TABLES... RACKING from the passing figure (still in soft focus) to a DEALER calling out: \nDEALER Insurance? \nAt the next table, ANOTHER DEALER pulls a six card 21. Off the players' stunned reactions. No way! One of the players instinctively glances behind him... but the figure has moved on. The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure as he heads toward... \n-- A HOT CRAPS TABLE. The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the background. The player throws... (we keep tracking with the figure) as the stickman calls it: SEVEN OUT! to a thundering chorus of disappointment. \n-- Our figure passes by in the foreground, while in the background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the ATM MACHINES. \n-- Following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor of SLOT MACHINES. CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE from the far end of the corridor. As the murky figure approaches, a player in the f.g. hits a jackpot. \n", "test1_true": "Suddenly -- with the approach of the figure -- both payouts trickle to a stop. \nPLAYER IN F.G. (kicks the slot machine) Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey, this ain't right. S'posed to be eight hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn manager? Who's in charge of these rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change lady... \nCASINO BAR FLOOR - BAR AREA - NIGHT \nFOLLOWING BEHIND the figure as he turns out of the slot corridor and heads over to the bar. He pours himself a cup of coffee. \nFIGURE/BERNIE Hey Doris, you got any cream? \nDORIS THE BARTENDER wanders over with a small container. She starts to pour... Empty. We quickly STEADICAM AROUND to reveal BERNIE LOOTZ's features for the first time. His sad sack eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container. \nBERNIE Forget it. \nHe's just about to leave, when an attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESS cruises up. NATALIE BELISARIO -- late 20's-mid-30's. Everything about her sparkles, except her eyes. \nThey're post-mortem. She appears frazzled. Sifts through some coin tips. \nNATALIE (sotto) Shit. (to Doris) Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please. \nA sheepish look comes over Bernie. He tries to catch her eye. She doesn't even glance at him. \nBERNIE Hi, Natalie. \nShe looks at him. Only the faintest hint of recognition. \nNATALIE Hi. Uh... \nBERNIE Bernie. \nNATALIE Yeah, Bernie. (to Doris) Hey, you seen Shelly around? He promised to position me at the tables tonight. I've been on skid row all week. \nDORIS (chilly) You didn't settle me from last night. \nNATALIE No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way under. It's been, like, an A.A. convention the whole week. I'll make up for it tonight. Promise. \nDoris mutters something under her breath -- heard that one before -- and dumps Natalie's drinks on her tray. \nBERNIE If I see Shelly, I'll let him know. That you're looking for him. \nNatalie grabs up her tray. Doesn't even look at Bernie. \nNATALIE Thanks. \nShe takes off. \nDORIS Bitch. That's the third time this month... (to Bernie) Let me get you that cream. \nBERNIE (staring after Natalie) Nah, it's okay. \nDORIS Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not unless you're looking to get short- changed. \nShe raises the empty cream container for effect, turns it over. A few drops dribble out. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nBernie limps away from the bar. We hear another spike of sound from the gaming area. As he approaches, a FLOORMAN stops him. \nFLOORMAN Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on eleven. \nBERNIE (nods) Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal. Have that... Natalie bring it over. The one working nickel slots next to the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly earlier, he wants her at the tables. \nThe floorman nods, walks off. Bernie makes for the rowdy gaming tables. Takes his time about it. His approach brings an ill-wind to the area. The players appear to sense it. \n", "test2_input": "BERNIE We gotta get you to the hospital. We'll talk about this later. \nNATALIE Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell me there's gonna be a later. \nBernie doesn't answer her. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NIGHT \nFADE IN on Bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on Natalie. \nHe tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions. \nNatalie's betrayal has finally sunken in. The man's in pain. \nHis natural instinct is to just take off. Run. Fuck Natalie. Fuck Shelly. Fuck this whole goddamn town. \nSuddenly he looks up. A couple of people pass by in front of him... and then there she is. Standing a few feet away, face patched-up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to approach him or not. \nThe sight of her just breaks Bernie's heart. He stands slowly, legs like jelly -- and in that instant it's all so clear to him. He walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in hers. \nShe tries to say something. He shakes his head. \nBERNIE Ssshh. \nThey embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their atoms into a single being. \nINT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nBernie drives down a quiet Vegas street. It's spooky. \nAlmost too quiet. All the lights are green as they cruise into the night. \nNATALIE Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's all gonna be okay. \nBERNIE Everything's gonna be fine. This is our time. This is you and me and we're going for it. \nNatalie leans over and kisses him. As she does so, she catches sight of her face in the mirror. Starts to tear up. \nBERNIE You look in the mirror, you don't like what you see, don't believe it. You look in my eyes. That's the only mirror you gonna need. Look in my eyes, Natalie. \nShe looks into Bernie's eyes. Sees the most beautiful girl in the world. Tears roll down her cheeks. \nBERNIE I love you. Marry me? \nOff Natalie's startled reaction... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT \nA NEON SIGN READS: \"HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL. OPEN 24 HOURS.\" \nBOOM DOWN as Bernie carries Natalie out of the chapel, their lips fused together. \nINT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nBernie and Natalie burn down the highway. The lights of the big city just a glimmer in the rearview. \nUp ahead, a billboard reads: THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO. TAKE A GAMBLE ON PARADISE. \nTIGHT on Bernie. His expression turns grim. Natalie picks up on it. She shakes her head. Silently pleading: Bernie, no. \nBernie tries to shrug it off. But the spectre of Shelly sits firmly on his shoulder. There's no escaping him. We see Bernie fighting it. Losing. SHIT! \nIn the next instant, Bernie pulls a quick U-turn across the middle shoulder, starts back toward Vegas. \n", "test2_true": "Bernie pulls into the parking lot. Kills his lights. \nINT. BERNIE'S BUICK - NIGHT \nBernie reaches for the door. Natalie grabs his arm. \nNATALIE You don't have to do this, Bernie. \nBERNIE Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right to his face. I will not look over my shoulder for the rest of my life -- our lives. \nNATALIE Bernie, your chart... that first night. I wasn't being straight with you. It's the worst chart I've ever seen. There's nothing in the cards for you. I'm scared... \nBERNIE Don't you see, that was before you opened your heart to me. Everything's different now. I got lady luck on my side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to me. \nNatalie shakily opens her purse, pulls out a handful of hundreds. Pushes the money at Bernie... \nNATALIE It's three thousand dollars. Take it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a down payment. We can send him the rest in installments... after we get settled. \nBERNIE I don't think -- \nNATALIE Take it. \nBernie stuffs the cash in his jacket. Climbs out. \nBERNIE Whatever happens, I -- \nNATALIE (abrupt) I know, Bernie. \nShe turns away. Stares out the window, tears streaming down her cheeks. \nNATALIE (sotto; gentle) I know. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nBernie makes for the Paradise Lounge. SPLIT SECOND FLASHBACK as he imagines Shelly laying into Natalie. Fast cuts. \nReverberating sound echoes. Just the fuel Bernie needs to make his stand. By the time he arrives at \nINT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nHe's practically foaming at the mouth with rage. He barges in to find Shelly at a table in agitated conversation with Nicky, Larry and Marty. They fall silent, realizing something is wrong. \nSHELLY Bernie, what's the matter? You look a little fucking spooked. \nBernie throws something in Shelly's face. It's that bloody rag Natalie was holding to her cheek. It lands on the table in front of everyone. \nShelly swats it away with disgust. Jumps to his feet. WHAM! \nBernie slugs him one. As Shelly doubles over, Bernie gets in his face. \nBERNIE You lay another finger on her, I swear to God I'll kill you. You hear me? I'll fuckin' kill you! \nShelly's goons quickly move in, grab Bernie. Drag him away. \nShelly composes himself, turns to his guests. \nSHELLY Will you excuse me for a moment? \nHe rushes off. Nicky shoots Larry a resigned look. \nINT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLou shoves Bernie inside. Bernie kisses floor. Shelly strides past, leans against his desk. Bernie slowly drags himself to his feet. \n", "test3_input": "BERNIE (a hoarse whisper) Why? Why, Shelly? \nSHELLY Because you never give up a good thing, Bernie. You are a good thing. The best fuckin' cooler there ever was. And I need him back. \nBERNIE He ain't never comin' back. \nSHELLY That's a dead man talking. \nBERNIE I'm through with this joint, Shelly. Natalie and me, we just got married. We're outta here. I'll get a job out there in the world. Send you half my paycheck every month. Make good on my obligations. \nSHELLY (gets in Bernie's face) You try to walk on me, Bernie, and I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of you. \nBERNIE I don't think so. \nShelly's expression: Oh yeah? \nBERNIE You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't the world's biggest loser no more. That honor's gonna fall upon you, Shelly. And maybe you had it all along. \nSHELLY What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser? \nBERNIE What you got? What do you got in your life besides this joint? \nSHELLY What the fuck more do I need? \nBERNIE You got nothin', Shelly. This place -- your legacy -- it's a mirage. You turn your back and it don't even exist. There's no day, there's no night, it's all just one big fuckin' blur and it don't count for nothin'! \nShelly looks to Tony and Lou: \nSHELLY You believe this fuckin' guy? \nBernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly. A first. \nBERNIE I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you got this fear of germs thing. But it goes deeper than that. You can't get close to no one. On an emotional level. You're the worst kind of gambler there ever was: too scared to put his chips on the table. Too scared to open his heart... to extend any real kinda friendship. Always afraid it's gonna end out in the desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's where it ends, that's where it ends. \nBernie turns his back on Shelly, strides over to the door. \nSHELLY That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz. All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face intensity. You almost sold me. (massages his throat) Man, I've got a fucking lump in my throat. (a beat) But it still don't change things. You bail on me without making good on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced to close the books on you. You and the broad. You leave me no choice. \nBernie turns, looks at Shelly. Shelly's dead serious. They hard stare each other for a beat. Bernie doesn't say anything. At least, not out loud. His eyes do all the talking: \"I guess you leave me no choice either.\" HOLD on Bernie's steely resolve. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nThis could be the opening of the film -- Bernie standing with his back to us, facing the gold elevator doors. Murky reflection. The floor lights ascending fast... \nThe doors open and the soundtrack goes SILENT. SLOW PUSH IN on him as he takes in the action -- a gladiator about to enter the Coliseum. Something comes alive in his eyes. A spark of determination. This is not the expression of a loser. CLOSE-UP as his foot steps onto the casino floor -- \nAn explosion of amplified CASINO WALLA shatters the previous silence. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nWe follow Bernie as he wanders through the casino like he's done a thousand times -- but this time with conviction. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT \nBernie steps up to an empty table, throws down the whole three grand onto the felt. \nBERNIE Change only... \nThe CREW working the table stop down as they realize who it is. The table is dead. Bernie couldn't be needed. The croupier slowly gathers up the green, hands it to the boxman. \nCROUPIER Check change three thousand. \nThe boxman counts the cash. \nBOXMAN This a pleasure cruise, Bernie? \n", "test3_true": "BOXMAN Well, it'll be a short one. Table's dead. \nCROUPIER It is now, anyway. \nThe others chuckle. The boxman counts out the chips; they're given to Bernie. He places them all on the passline. \nThe stickman pushes over the dice. Bernie picks a couple. \nHe throws.... \nSTICKMAN Yo Eleven! Pay the line. \nBernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings. He lets it ride. The table quickly fills up with hungry players. \nBernie throws the dice again... \nSTICKMAN Winner seven! \nBernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line bet. \nThe other players also collect their winnings. They can feel something in the air. \nBernie, forehead beaded with sweat, rubs the felt a little before he picks up the dice. He throws... \nSTICKMAN Six easy. Easy way six! \nBernie takes double odds on his bet. The boxman isn't sure what to do. Does he stop him? Does he dare? \nIn the b.g., people gather to watch the action. Whatever it is, it's catching. The table next to them bursts into applause. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR \u0097 MONTAGE - NIGHT \nA -- Close on a slot machine as it pays out. The woman grabs the payout feverishly. \nB -- A group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer busts out. \nC -- The line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer. \n-- CHIPS. Stacks and stacks of chips, being meticulously counted. \nD -- A quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number twenty-one. The dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large stack of chips in the twenty-one square. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT \nA shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the outcome of the throw. Followed by a thunderous release as the point is made. \nIn the center of it all. Bernie Lootz. His rail is nearly full of chips. The other players pat him on the back and shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line. \nHe's a winner. And it's infectious. He's gone and \"contaminated\" the entire casino. The slots are ringing out of control. CHEERING. WHOOPING. MOANS of delight. This much excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off. \nBernie just gazes around in amazement. If only Natalie could see him now... \nBERNIE (sotto) Natalie... this is you... \nBernie takes a thousand dollars in chips, tosses it gently to the croupier. \nBERNIE For the boys. \nThe entire crew stop for a moment out of respect. Bernie notices. They all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money. \nSTICKMAN Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO bets, C&E, any seven... \nINT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \n"}

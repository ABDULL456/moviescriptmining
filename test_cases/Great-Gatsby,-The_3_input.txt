Exhausted, Gatsby turns... 
GATSBY Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? 
CLOSE ON: Nick. 
NICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... 
NICK Jay... You oughtta go away. 
He helps Gatsby cover the car. 
NICK (CONT'D) Tonight. They'll trace your car. 
GATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight. 
NICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? 
Nick follows him from the garage toward the house. 
GATSBY Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together. 
NICK But Jay she-- 
Sensing Nick's tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. 
GATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She'll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. 
NICK JAY-- 
GATSBY She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning. 
Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... 
He turns to go in but stops. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Wait up with me? The suns almost up... 
NICK (V.O.) That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT 
Gatsby's voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast, lonely mansion as he confesses... 
GATSBY You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty. (MORE) 
GATSBY (CONT'D) I suppose that's why I make things up about myself... But I`ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- 
As Gatbsy continues, Nick's V.O. FADES UP: 
NICK (V.O.) He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he'd joined Wolfsheim in the business... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN 
In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. 
NICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby's... extraordinary gift for hope. 
GATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. 
NICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... 
GATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. 
NICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. 
GATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... 
Finally, Nick is able to ask: 
NICK What was in the letter? 
Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... 
GATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return-- 
In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: "Daisy, the truth is... I'm penniless." 
GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT'D) I asked her to wait until I'd made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. 
The IMAGE of Daisy fades... 
GATSBY (CONT'D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. 
NICK (V.O.) It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A hand takes a revolver from a desk drawer... 
It is Wilson. 
FLOAT: Toward the window behind him... 
WE SEE the staring eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. 
WILSON God sees everything. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - MORNING

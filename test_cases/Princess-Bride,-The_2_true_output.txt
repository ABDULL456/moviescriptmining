Inigo pounds again. 
MIRACLE MAX (opening a small window in the door) What? What? 
INIGO Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? 
MIRACLE MAX The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed! 
He shuts the window. They rap on the door. 
MIRACLE MAX (opening the window) Beat it or I'll call the Brute Squad. 
FEZZIK I'm on the Brute Squad. 
MIRACLE MAX (looking at the Giant) You are the Brute Squad. 
INIGO We need a miracle. It's very important. 
MIRACLE MAX Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle. 
INIGO He's already dead. 
MIRACLE MAX (for the first time, interested) He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in. 
He unlocks the door and lets them in. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO AND FEZZIK 
hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp. 
MIRACLE MAX I've seen worse. 
He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. 
INIGO Sir. Sir. 
MIRACLE MAX Hah? 
INIGO We're really in a terrible rush. 
MIRACLE MAX (He takes nothing from nobody) Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? 
INIGO Sixty-five. 
MIRACLE MAX Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. 
INIGO This is noble, sir. (pointing to Westley, remorseful) His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation. 
MIRACLE MAX Are you a rotten liar. 
INIGO I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years. 
MIRACLE MAX Your first story was better. (looking around) Where's that bellows? (spots it) He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him. 
He goes to get a huge bellows. 
INIGO (stupefied) He's dead. He can't talk. 
MIRACLE MAX Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth. 
Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. 
MIRACLE MAX Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do. 
INIGO What's that? 
He stops pumping. 
MIRACLE MAX Go through his clothes and look for loose change. 
He starts pumping again. 
MIRACLE MAX (to Westley) Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's so important? What you got here that's worth living for? 
And he presses lightly on Westley's chest. 
WESTLEY ... tr ... oooo .... luv... 
Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench. 
INIGO True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. 
MIRACLE MAX Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated 
A WOMAN'S VOICE -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR -- 
VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and toward 
MIRACLE MAX -- get back, witch -- 
VALERIE I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore. 
MIRACLE MAX You never had it so good.

LT. BASTIAN Direct hit! 
ELLO ASTY But no damage! Jess reacts. 
POE Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. 
INT. X-WING - DAY 
A BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF 
TIE FIGHTERS! 
POE Guys, we got a lot of company! 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY 
Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby. 
FINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. 
HAN You sure you're up for this? 
FINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to 
SOMETHING BEHIND 
FINN) Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY 
A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY 
Rey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN Are you all right? 
REY Yeah. 
HAN Good. 
FINN What happened -- did he hurt you? 
REY Finn. What are you doing here?! 
FINN We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. 
FINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? 
REY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace. 
REY (CONT'D) Thank you.

RILEY is standing rigidly in front of his bunk in crew quarters, flanked by the rest of the VETERANS in similar positions, facing SLOAN. 
RILEY Will we be issued weapons, sir? 
SLOAN (a sneering smile) No, Riley...no weapons.  You're not a soldier, Riley.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCHES - DAY 
The NEW SOLDIER comes straight, like some inexorable death machine, lumbering awkwardly with his burden of weapons, goggled and blank faced. 
A PIONEER is backing away ten yards in front of him, firing wildly.  POW!  POW!  POW! 
The NEW SOLDIER looks at one of his armor-gloved hands, opening the palm in front of his face.  His hand's been hit.  He shakes it, annoyed, like it was a bee sting, then he aims at the PIONEER. 
WHOOOOSH!  A tongue of fire from the NEW SOLDIER's flame thrower engulfs the helpless PIONEER as we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY 
PIONEERS are crouching in the room when the door bursts open, and a tongue of flame turns the room into a firestorm and we...

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY 
SANDRA has NATHAN screaming in her arms as she calmly herds frightened CHILDREN through a corridor, JOHNNY, WILL, and ELLEN among them. 
SANDRA Keep going, children, don't panic, don't panic. 
But if her demeanor doesn't reveal her fear, her eyes do. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  INSIDE ANOTHER TRENCH - DAY 
Two Pioneers, SALLY and RED, lunge from a doorway into the trench and fire a rifle and a pistol at a THIRD SOLDIER who's advancing along the trench. 
BANG!  BANG!  PING!  SPLAT! 
SALLY and RED dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer named SINGH is crouched, watching with alarm the THIRD SOLDIER advancing unfazed. 
ANGLE ON THE THIRD SOLDIER coming toward them. 
ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS huddled in the doorway. 
RED They got armored vests.  You got to aim for exposed parts like the face... 
SINGH Here goes. 
RED and SALLY watch SINGH step out directly in front of the advancing THIRD SOLDIER and FIRE five shots rapidly...PING! PIZG!  PING!  PING!  PING! 
WHOOOOSH!  RED and SALLY see SINGH incinerated before their eyes. 
Exchanging a horrified glance, they turn to retreat down the interior corridor, but before they get two steps, they freeze... 
A SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking down a door.  They can't go that way! 
Trapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger, and... 
A blur!  Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard to the floor of the trench. 
But he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and fight except... 
A knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one swift movement, and... 
The THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi goggles is... 
TODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and fierce soldier's eyes. 
ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY, where RED, SALLY, and another PIONEER peer around the corner, eyes wide with amazement at the sight of TODD kneeling over his victim. 
ANGLE ON TODD, slipping the utility belt off the dead THIRD SOLDIER, yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body, stuffing a heavy pistol in his own waistband. 
RED approaches timidly. 
RED You want help, partner? 
TODD glances up at him, and RED sees TODD'S eyes and RED backs away quickly because... 
TODD looks badder even than the new soldiers! 
Turning back to the dead man, TODD goes for the last item...the goggles.  Ripping them off he reveals... 
A one-eyed soldier.  The dead man staring up at him is MELTON. 
For just a moment TODD stares into the dead face, revealing nothing of how he feels, as we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY 
NATHAN is SCREAMING in terror on the floor, ignored as SANDRA and CHILDREN haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  The stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor. 
As they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
The FIRST SOLDIER, as big as an offensive tackle, shoulders the door again, and it gives... 
INT.  ROOM 
CHILDREN SCREAM as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards, and the door opens part way, revealing the FIRST SOLDIER. 
SANDRA grabs NATHAN and hands him to one of the children.

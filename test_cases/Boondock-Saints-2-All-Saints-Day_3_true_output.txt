INT. BACK TO PRESENT, LUXURY APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
EUNICE One...thing has always amazed me. 
Eunice stands dead center.   Everyone watches... 
EUNICE (CONT'D) How quiet it gets. You ever noticed that? It's hard to imagine that just a few hours ago, it was the God damn O.K. coral in here. 
FLASH TO WHITE... 
FANTASY SEQUENCE:   Cool Country Western music! 
CLOSE ON:   A pair of cowboy boots pacing toward. 
Eunice stands before the looming windows.    The immaculate food table stretches before her. 
She is now in full cowgirl regalia: Leather chaps, rawhide coat, boots, cowboy hat and a pair of gleaming six guns on her hips. 
With the brim of her hat slung low, Eunice bursts into twirling gunplay with her Colts. She spins them all around, flipping them, catching them, etc. She holsters and stops. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) One thang I'm gon guarantee ya... 
EXT. SCAFFOLD -- SAME TIME 
First, Connor jumps off, then Murphy.    They fall down and out in slow motion, knives in hand.

Eunice rolls the chamber of one of her Colts along her arm. 
EUNICE We gon have us a good time... 
INT. OUTSIDE WINDOWS -- SAME TIME 
The boys snap to a stop and swing in, toward the building.    With their free hand they each pull a .50 cal. 
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER 
EUNICE ...in the old barn tonight! 
The Country Western music goes hard core! 
SLO-MO: Two bullet holes pierce the windows behind Eunice as she levels her Colts. The mammoth panes shatter but stay in the frame. 
SLO-MO: All gangsters bolt upright as their plasma screen explodes with the boys' rounds. Some pull weapons. 
INT. HALL -- SAME TIME 
Romeo pulls his .45's and takes out the guard.   He kicks in the door and rushes in... 
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER 
SLO-MO: The brothers smash through the glass.    They fire as they swing over Eunice's head. 
SLO-MO: Eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut their ropes in mid air with the Rambo knives. The brothers land on their knees. Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the table. 
SLO-MO: Eunice runs along the table top, crushing food and keeping pace with the boys as all three let the led out. 
SLO-MO:   The gangsters and button men return fire in chaos.

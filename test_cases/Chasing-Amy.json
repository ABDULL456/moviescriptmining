{"test1_input": "She walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he turns and heads back to his car. As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her. \nAnd there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing. \nEXT STUDIO - DAY \nBanky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the door.  He picks up the mail on the floor. \nINT STUDIO - DAY \nHe closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail. He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats. Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus.  They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. \nALYSSA (off Holden's reaction) I take it that's not good. \nHOLDEN (getting up) Stay here. (he kisses her and exits) \nEXT STREET - DAY \nBanky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden saunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's gaze. \nBANKY Catholic school girls. \nAcross the street, the Catholic High School is letting out.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters smoke, frolic, wait for their bus. \nBANKY The uniform is what does it for me.  I wish I'd have went with more Catholic school girls when I was a kid.  As it stands.  I have no \"...and then she unzipped her jumper...\" stories. \nHOLDEN You looked weirded out back there. \nBANKY That's my couch you were fucking on. \nHOLDEN Sorry. \nBANKY I wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch. \nHOLDEN She had boxers on. \nBanky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the OC girls. \nBANKY This is all going to end badly. \nHOLDEN You don't know that. \nBANKY I know you.  You're way too conservative for that girl.  She's been around and seen things we've only read about in books. \nHOLDEN But we have read about them.  So we're prepared. \nBANKY There's no 'we' here.  You're going to have to go through this alone.  And it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis. When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside.  You'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop.  Because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love. \nHOLDEN Maybe it is for her as well. \nBANKY Somehow I doubt it. \nHOLDEN Everyone's not out to get someone in life.  Bank. \nBANKY Everybody has an agenda.  Everyone. \nHOLDEN Yourself? \nBANKY My agenda is to watch your back. \n", "test1_true": "BANKY To insure that all this time we've spent together, building something, wasn't wasted. \nHOLDEN She's not going to ruin the comic. \nBANKY I wasn't talking about the comic. (gets up) I'm going to gel a bagel.  Clean off my fucking couch so I can watch TV. \nBanky walks away.  Holden shakes his head. \nINT ALYSSA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nAn all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  Tory letters a page.  Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork. Dalia drinks wine.  Alyssa paints the cover. \nDALIA From what I understand, when you sign with a publisher, someone else does all this work for you, and you just sit back and collect. \nALYSSA And miss these last minute cram sessions with my nearest and dearest? Never. \nTORY I don't know what she's bitching about.  All she's done since we got here is pound Merlot. \nDALIA I'm sorry weren't you the one who misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen? Yeah, you're a real help. \nNICA What I'd like to know is why we're here at all when we haven't seen Princess funny-Book in a month. \nJANE Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking up with? \nALYSSA 'Shacking up!' Please. (stops painting; smiles wide) I'm so in love! \nEveryone aww's.  Alyssa buries her face, giggling. \nALYSSA I know.  I know -I feel like such a goon.  But I can't help it - we have such a great time together. \nDALIA Who is it?  Don't even tell me it's Ms. Thing from the C.D. place.  I'll kill you. \nALYSSA It's not her.  It's someone you guys don't know. \nNICA That chick you left the restaurant with that night? \nALYSSA They're not.  From around here. \nTORY Don't even tell me you met her down the shore! \nJANE Eww!  Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey dyke! \nTORY With huge hair and acid-washed jeans! \nThey all cackle.  Alyssa tries to laugh with them. \nDALIA Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or what? \nALYSSA For your information, they don't have big hair or wear acid wash. (goes back to painting) They're from my home town. \nDalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously. \nDALIA Why are you playing the pronoun game? \nALYSSA What?  What are you talking about? I'm not even. \nDALIA You are. \"I met someone.\"  \"We have a great time.  \"They're from my home town.\"  Doesn't this tube of wonderful have a name! \nALYSSA (beat) Holden. \n", "test1_id": 2409, "test2_input": "HOOPER Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect.  What is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world. (shakes his head) As for this hang-up with Alyssa's past, maybe what's really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true. \nHOLDEN What do you mean? \nHOOPER Holden - don't even try to come off like you don't know what I'm saying. Men need to believe that they're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory.  And it's hard not to let them believe it.  I let my boys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that \"I've never done this before...\" bullshit, and let 'em labor under the delusion that they rockin' my world, until I can't stand them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the truth.  It's a sick game.  The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there. \nHOLDEN I can accept that. \nHOOPER Honey, that almost sounded convincing. Do yourself a favor - just ask her about her past, point blank.  Get it out of the way, before it gets too big for both ya'll to move. (spotting something OC) Oooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'! \nHooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do Girls - All XXX Action.' \nINT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT \nOn the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and back, checking galore. \nIn the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches the game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm. \nALYSSA Since most of these people are rooting for the home team, I'm going to cheer for the visitors.  I'm a big visitors fan - especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go. (smiles at Holden; no response) That was a joke.  A little wacky wordplay? \nHOLDEN What do you mean, 'visitors'? \nALYSSA Was I being too obscure?  The kind that - until recently - had no dicks and would spend the night. \nHOLDEN So that was until recently! \nALYSSA Oh, yeah. (shouting; to ice) Hey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling or something! \nHOLDEN So nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together? \nALYSSA (beat) Something on your mind, Holden? \nHOLDEN No, I was just wondering, \nALYSSA If I've been 'faithful' or something? \nHOLDEN Look, I was just asking. \nALYSSA (toucher his face) Oh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for you. (to ice) CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!  THE GUY ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY GUYS!! (to Holden) I told you I was great at sporting events.  Imagine what a bitch I could be if I knew what was going on? \nON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS. One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off. The other Player gives chase. \nAlyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head \nHOLDEN That'd make Banky half right. \nALYSSA About what? \nHOLDEN He said all the girls from North were bitches and sluts. \nALYSSA Really.  I'm sorry - you two left high school behind how many years ago? (grabs his face and kisses his cheek) Can I put some of my books in your locker? (goes back to watching game) \nHOLDEN (under his breath) How about your yearbook. \nON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player with the puck. \nAlyssa jumps to her feet. \nALYSSA (to ice) IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR ASS!! (to guy next to her) Right? \n", "test2_true": "ALYSSA (sitting back down) 'Finger Cuffs'? \nHOLDEN Yeah.  In your senior yearbook your nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is that? \nALYSSA It was?  Shit, damned if I can remember.  I'd look it up, but I threw all that shit our years ago? (beat) Where'd you see a North yearbook? \nHOLDEN Do you know Rick Derris? \nON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard. Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his gloves. \nThe crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild. \nALYSSA Rick?  Sure.  We used to hang out in high school. (to ice) PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER TWELVE!! \nHOLDEN Did you go out with him or something? \nALYSSA (eyes on the ice) Date Rick Derris?  No.  We just hung out a lot. \nHOLDEN Just... you and him? \nALYSSA No.  Me, Rick, and... um... what was that guy's name...? \nHOLDEN Cohee? \nALYSSA Yeah!  Cohee Lundin.  God, I haven't thought about that name in years. \nON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face. \nHolden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his companion.  Alyssa's into the game. \nALYSSA I remember those guys'd come over almost everyday after school.  They'd bug my sisters, look for porno tapes in my dad's closet, raid our fridge. They really took advantage of my parents never being home. \nON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and gut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's anger, so enthralled with the action is she. \nALYSSA (starts laughing) This one day... Rick pulled out his dick and chased me around the house with it!  Right in front of Cohee!  I couldn't believe it!  Guys are weird - I thought the whole size hang-up made you all terrified to show your dicks to each other? \nON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a barrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice. \nHolden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's still in the game. \nHOLDEN Rick pulled his dick out?  Really? What'd you do? \nALYSSA (looks him dead in the eye) I blew him while Cohee fucked me. \nON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming his fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out like a geyser, and Two goes down hard. \nHolden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes. \nHOLDEN Excuse me!?! \nALYSSA That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it?  Isn't that what this little cross- examination of your's is about?  Well try not to be so obvious about it next time, there are subtler ways of badgering a witness. (to Bystander) Am I right? \nBYSTANDER (to Holden) Jeez, even I knew what you were getting at. \nALYSSA (gathering her stuff) If you wanted some background information on me, all you had to do was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered it.  You didn't have to play Hercules fucking Poirot! \nShe storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander watches them go. \nBYSTANDER (to companion) I told you these were good seats. \n", "test2_id": 2410, "test3_input": "4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him. \n5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, angrily. \n6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He jumps up and dashes out of the park. \nINT STUDIO - NIGHT \nBanky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front of them. \nHOLDEN I know you're wondering why I asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately. \nBANKY I just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on. \nALYSSA Fuck you. \nBANKY Not even if you let me videotape it. \nHOLDEN Enough! (they both look at him) I've been going through things, over and over.  And I dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways.  Banky - there's friction between us for the first time in our lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this M-TV thing. \nBANKY How perceptive. \nHOLDEN Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because I don't know how to deal with... your past, I guess. \nBANKY That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd have said the whole double-stuff thing... \nHOLDEN (right in his face) I'm only going to say it once: shut up. (back to pacing) Now - I know I'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts.  With you, Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel inadequate.  Because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison. \nALYSSA That doesn't matter to me... \nHOLDEN Please.  I have to get through this. (beat) And with you Banky - I know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but I guess I just didn't acknowledge it. (takes a deep breath) You're in love with me. \nBANKY (makes a face; beat) What? \nHOLDEN You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it makes sense - we've been together so long, we have so much in common... \nBANKY (getting up) Well, I've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', so I'll be... \nHolden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed and speechless - looks away. \nHOLDEN It's something you're going to have to deal with.  Bank.  You may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, and your sense of humor as well. \nBANKY Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes... \nHOLDEN Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll feel much better. \nHe grabs a chair from the side of the room. \nHOLDEN Now - at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that I've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other? \nAlyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head. \nALYSSA (under her breath) Don't. \nHOLDEN And when I did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me.  I know what we have to do.  And then you - Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... can finally be... alright. \nALYSSA (again, under her breath) Please don't say it. \nHOLDEN (sits in the chair; takes a long beat) We've all got to have sex together. \n", "test3_true": "HOLDEN Don't you see?  That would take care of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore.  I'll have done something on par with all the experience you've had.  And it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful.  And Banky - you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take.  And it'll be okay, because it'll be with me - your best friend for years.  We've been everything to each other but intimates.  And now, we'll have been through that together too.  And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved.  And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone. Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true communion.  We have to do this.  For me, for both of you... for all of our sakes.  This will keep us together. (beat) What do you say? \nBanky stares forward, wide-eyed.  He leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs. \nBANKY Sure. \nHolden smiles at his friend.  Then he looks at Alyssa. \nHOLDEN You know I need this.  You know it'll help. \nAlyssa looks at him, sadly. \nALYSSA No. \nHolden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief. \nHOLDEN No?  I... I thought you'd be into this. \nALYSSA You did?  What does that say about me? \nHOLDEN But you've... you've done... stuff... like this.  This should be no big deal for you. \nALYSSA You don't want this. (lights her cigarette) You really don't want this.  Trust me. \nHOLDEN I need this.  This has to happen.  Why can't you see that?  And how can you not?  What does that say about me? You can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but I ask you to share an experience like it - where it's about intimacy - and you say no? \nALYSSA (inhales from her cigarette, takes a beat) I can't. \nHolden moves to her side of the couch. \nHOLDEN You can.  I'll be there.  And when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together.  And we'll finally be on the same level together. And then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish. \nA tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and touches his face. \nALYSSA Oh Holden. (trying to compose herself) That time is over for me.  I've been there.  I've done it.  And I didn't find what I was looking for in any of it.  I found that in you - in us. Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on.  It'll create more. \nHOLDEN No it won't.  I thought about all of that. \nALYSSA No, it will.  Maybe you'll see me differently from then on - maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment.  Maybe I'll moan differently and then you'll resent Banky, and become suspicious of us.  Or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship.  Or what if- I sincerely doubt it, but what if - I saw something in Banky that I never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you.  I've been down roads like this before; many times.  I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience.  But I've had those experiences on my own. I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm past that now. (touches his face; stares to cry) Or maybe I just love you too much. And I feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone. Because I never wanted to share you (holds it in; gets up) Regardless I can't be a part of this. (beat) Or you.  Not anymore (hugs him) I love you.  I always will.  Know that. \nShe releases him, then slaps him. \nALYSSA But I'm not your fucking whore. \nAlyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and down. \nALYSSA He's your's again. \nShe walks our of the studio.  The door closes behind her. \nBanky and Holden stand there, silently.  Cut to black. \nINT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY \nIt's ONE YEAR later.  We're at another show, not unlike the one from the opening. \nA copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.

{"train": "Chasing Amy \nChasing Amy \nWritten by Kevin Smith \nINT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad others. The most prominent one is called \u0011BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'.  A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame. HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his head.  BANKY looks over his shoulder. \nBANKY Felt Like this fucking day would never come.  Issue two - on the shelf. \nHOLDEN Yippee. \nBANKY Don't start, alright!  This is a cool moment, and I'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it.  How often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it! (points to name on cover) Banky Edwards- right! (points to the other) Holden McNeil. HOLDEN I know my name. BANKY C'mon, sour puss.  We got the rest of our lives to be artists.  But it's supply and demand.  And right now, the unwashed masses demand this. HOLDEN (off comic) This is easy, alright!  And right now it pays the bills.  Just don't forget that we're better than this. BANKY I'll tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here. They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game. BANKY (lays books on the counter) Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up. STEVE-DAVE (not looking up) Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who it is!  The local celebrities.  Quick - get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple it's value. WALT I'm not that in need of fifteen cents right now. They snicker and high-five one another.  Holden rolls his eyes. BANKY You guys operate the smallest, ladies' bridge circle I've ever seen. WALT For your information, we're playing \u0011Crimson Mystical Mages' - an overpower card game. Not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced\tas this - there are no dick or poopie jokes involved. BANKY (to Holden) I don't think they're fans. WALT No, we're not.  You're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky. STEVE-DAVE And obviously your handlers or hangers- on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue.  And when you get your foot in the door of the business, what do you do!  You turn out a piece of shit like \u0011Bluntman and Chronic'. WALT Tell him, Steve-Dave. STEVE-DAVE (off comic) \u0011Bluntman and Chronic'.  Pah. What was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue! WALT The Stinky-palm. STEVE-DAVE Stinky-palm.  You give comics a bad name I tell all my customers not to buy it, to spend their money on a real comic book. WALT Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store Frank Miller's. STEVE-DAVE This is the reality at Comic-Toast - you're not going to get your ass kissed here, because both me and Walt think you suck. WALT And me. STEVE-DAVE I said that. Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then goes back to playing his game with Walt.  Holden and Banky stare, shocked.  Banky nudges Holden and they both exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to playing. WALT I've got a dragon card - forty power- ups and twelve life points!  Ha!  I get your elf card! STEVE-DAVE You're such a bitch!  But thankfully, I've saved a dark forces Shaman card for just such an occasion. WALT You suck!  Eighty six life-power points to my twenty two! STEVE-DAVE I schooled their asses, now I'm schooling your's. Suddenly.  A trash can crashes through the front window. Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering one another.  They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess.  He pulls something off the garbage can and reads it. WALT You know it was those two fucks! Let's call the cops and have them busted!  I know where their studio is! Or better yet, let's sue!  You can sue them, Steve-Dave! STEVE-DAVE (still reading note) That won't be necessary. WALT What?!  Why the hell not! STEVE-DAVE (holds up check) Because this is a check for three times what that window cost. (reading note) \u0013Dear critics - thanks for the insight. But like my grandmother always said - \u0011Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.. and break their window.' Kiss it,\t\tBanky the Hack. P.S. - Your card game blows.\u0014 WALT He said \u0013Kiss it\u0014! CREDITS INT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting with comics - leans forward, smiling. FAN Could you sign it \u0013To a really big fan\u0014! Holden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing- to-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half- smile in return, HOLDEN You bet. We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS - CREATORS OF \u0011BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super-heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan. FAN I love this book man!  This shit's awesome.  I wish I was like these guys - getting stoned, talking all raw about\t\tchicks and fighting supervillains!  I love these guys! They're like \u0011Cheech and Chong' meet \u0011Bill and fed'! HOLDEN I like to chink of them as \u0011Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet \u0011Vladimir and Estragon'. FAN Yeah! (beat) Who! BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR. COLLECTOR So you draw this! BANKY (signing the comic) I ink it and I'm also the colorist. The guy next to me draws it.  But we both came up with the characters, COLLECTOR What's that mean - you \u0011ink it'! BANKY Well.  It means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in ink COLLECTOR So you just trace! Banky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues signing. BANKY It's not tracing.  I add depth and shading to give the image mere definition. Only then does the drawing really take shape. COLLECTOR You go over what he draws with a pen - that's tracing. BANKY (hands book back to Collector) Not really. (calling out) Next! A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers. COLLECTOR Hey man.  If somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it, not going out-side the designated original art what do call that! LITTLE KID (shrugs) I don't know.  Tracing? COLLECTOR (to Banky) See? BANKY It's not tracing. COLLECTOR Oh, but it is. BANKY (to Little Kid) Do you want Lour book signed or what? COLLECTOR Hey - don't get all testy with him just because you have a problem with your station in life. BANKY I'm secure with what I do. COLLECTOR Then say it - you're a tracer. BANKY (grabbing Little Kid's book) How should I sign this? LITTLE KID (grabs book back) I don't want you to sign it, I want the guy that draws Bluntman and Chronic to sign it.  You're just a tracer. COLLECTOR Tell him, Little Shaver. Holden accepts a comic from another Fan. HOLDEN (off comic) Who do I sign it to! Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He looks to his left and freaks. Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. The Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky. COLLECTOR Jesus!  All I did was call him a tracer! BANKY (to Collector) I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?! HOLDEN (to Security Guard) Could you get him out of here! The Security Guards drag the collector away. COLLECTOR Hey, wait a sec!  He jumped me!  And you're dragging me away!! (exiting) Fucking tracer! BANKY (calling OC) YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!! \nHOLDEN Can I explain the audience principle to you!  If you insult and accost them, then we have no audience. BANKY He started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! He's lucky I didn't put my pen through his thorax! HOLDEN Need I remind you... (holds up watch) Curtain's in ten minutes. INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY HOOPER fills the frame.  He comes off like a typical, pro- black/anti-white homeboy. HOOPER For years in this industry whenever an African-American character - hero or villain - was introduced usually by white artists and writers - they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes: Black Panther, Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat.. VOICE FROM CROWD She's white. HOOPER She is? (beat) Well bust this - regardless. We're at a panel discussion.  The room is full.  Five creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in front of them. (One of them is a very striking Girl.)  The banner behind them reads \u0011WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'. HOOPER (holds up comic) Now my book, \u0011White-Hating Coon', doesn't have any of that bullshit. The hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you European mother fuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, \u0011Cause I'm here to tell you - the chickens are comin' home to roost, ya'll: the black man's no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and Sci- Fi/Fantasy!  We're keeping it real, and we're gonna get respect - by any means necessary! During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front. HOLDEN (calling out) Bullshit!  Lando Calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the Millennium Falcon! Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment HOOPER Who said that?!? HOLDEN (standing) I did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of Science Fiction/Fantasy. HOOPER Fuck Lando Calrissian!  Uncle Tom nigger!  Always some white boy gotta invoke \u0011the holy trilogy'! Bust this - those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down - even in a galaxy far, far away.  Check this shit.  You got cracker farm-boy Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - blond hair, blue eyes. And then you've got\t\tDarth Vader: the blackest brother in the galaxy.  Nubian God. BANKY What's a Nubian? HOOPER Shut the fuck up!  Now Vader, he's a spiritual brother, with the force and all that shit.  Then this cracker Skywalker gets his hands on a light- saber, and the boy decides he's gonna run the fucking universe - gets a whole Klan of whites together, and they're gonna bust up Vader's \u0011hood the Death Star.  Now what the fuck do you call that! BANKY Intergalactic Civil War! HOOPER Gentrification.  They're gonna drive our the black element, to make the galaxy quote, unquote \u0011safe' for white folks. HOLDEN But Vader turns, out to be Luke's father.  And in Jedi, they become friends. HOOPER Don't make me bust a cap in your ass, yo!  Jedi's the most insulting installment, because Vader's beautiful,\t\tblack visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty white man! They're trying to tell us that deep inside, we all want to be white! BANKY Well isn't that true! Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air. HOOPER BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!!  I'LL KILL ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER FUCKIN' EYES ON!!! The crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing. Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off the floor. HOOPER (breaking character) \u0011What's a Nubian!'  Bitch, you almost made me laugh! Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay. Actually - he is.  Banky smiles. BANKY Well what about you!  You didn't tell me you were going to scream \u0011Black Rage'.  I nearly pissed myself. HOLDEN How do you manage to get away with this all the time?  Shouldn't cops be busting your head open right about now? BANKY Wrong coast. HOOPER (off gun) Well this right here - she full of blanks, okay.  And Opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before I go on. HOLDEN Your publisher condones these theatrics! HOOPER Condones?  Honey, they insist.  I need to sell the image to sell the book Would the audience still buy the \u0011Black Rage' angle if they found out the book was written by a.. a... BANKY Faggot. HOOPER When you say if it sounds so sexy... (he kisses Banky full on the lips) BANKY (wipes his lips) Hey, hey!  I'll play your victim, but not your catcher. VOICE How is it that you sound like Minister Farakhan when you're on stage.. They turn to see... A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.  She's the striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much. ALYSSA ...and the King of Pop when you're nor. HOOPER Look out, boys - this kitten has a whip. ALYSSA (shoves and slaps him) Always before I get to speak!  I swear - the next con I attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel, if I see your name anywhere near the List, I'm passing. HOOPER (defending himself) Holden.  Banky - this pile of P.M.S. is Alyssa Jones.  She does that book \u0011Idiosyncratic Routine'.  This is the fourth panel we've been on together, and even though she knows my publisher sets this up and pays for the event. She still gets mad when it ends with my act. ALYSSA I just wish I was the one who gets to shoot you. HOOPER That's what my father said when I came - nay - leapt out of the closet (off guys) These boys do \u0011Bluntman and Chronic', which outsells both of our books put together, hence they're never on a panel with the likes of us.  They slumming right now. BANKY I've read your book.  It's cute. Chick stuff, but cute. Holden hits him. BANKY What? HOLDEN (shoots him a look; to Alyssa) Sorry about him.  He's dealing with being an inker. ALYSSA (to Banky) Oh. You trace! Banky seethes. HOLDEN (shaking her hand) I really enjoy your book I'm surprised we've never met at any other Con's before. ALYSSA Lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the Pink Black Panther here plays Chuck D. for the fanboys. HOOPER Hey, jealousy. (to the Boys) I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave drink.  Do the Garden-Staters have to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can you stay for a round in the big, scary city! BANKY We're gonna take off soon... HOLDEN We'll go. Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to Hooper. BANKY We'll go. INT BAR - NIGHT Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table drinking, talking, and smoking. BANKY Archie, alright!  Archie and the Riverdale gang were a pure and fun- lovin' bunch.  You can't find dysfunction in those comics, because they were just flat out wholesome. HOOPER Archie and Jughead were lovers. (sips his drink) BANKY Shut the fuck up. HOOPER It's true.  Archie was the bitch and Jughead was the butch - that's why Jughead wears that crown-looking hat all the time: he the king, of queen Archie's world. BANKY Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on HOLDEN He's got a point.  Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica. BANKY Because he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes!  He never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three-way! HOOPER (pulls out a dollar and hands it to Banky) Here.  I want you to go down to the corner store and buy yourself a clue. Go on. BANKY Eat it.  Urkel. HOOPER I told you to watch it with that Urkel shit.  Face it, girl - Archie's a sister. BANKY (getting up; to Hooper) That's it.  You. HOOPER Moi? BANKY You are marching back across the street with me, and we're going to pick up a shit load of Archie books, I am going to prove to you - beyond the shadow of a doubt that Archie was all about pussy.  Come on. HOOPER (sliding out of booth) This boy is conflicted, I shall play mother-therapist for him.  You two sit tight.  We shall return promptly. Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at the table. ALYSSA Is he always Like that! HOLDEN For years now.  Started back in third grade - a nun was teaching us about the Blessed Trinity.  She's going on about the three persons in one God thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and he just goes ballistic.  I guess it was too big for him to grasp.  They got into this huge fight. ALYSSA Please.  How bad could it have been! HOLDEN You ever seen a nun call a small child a \u0011fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, Shit like that's bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday. ALYSSA And your parochial school misadventures! HOLDEN Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass. Turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell you how many mornings after serous benders\t\tI'd wake up next to strange priests. ALYSSA Aren't you the sharp wit! HOLDEN Sharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy- molestation humor.  Probably why the extended family quit inviting me to First Communion parties. Alyssa laughs.  Holden smiles. ALYSSA (looking OC) You play darts! HOLDEN Not professionally.  You know - only in bars. \nAT THE DART BOARD \nA dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the board. \nAlyssa winds up with another dart.  Holden watches. Her's always hit. His never do. \nALYSSA So your new book seems to be selling like mad. \nHOLDEN It goes back to something my grandmother told me when I was a kid. \"Holden,\" she said \"The big bucks are in dick and fart jokes.\"  She was a church-goer. \nALYSSA Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell - pitying his good fortune.  I'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in. \nHOLDEN I'm sorry - did I detect a note of bitter envy in there! \nALYSSA Nope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at all.  There's very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex- clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns field.  If I sell two issues, I feel like John Grisham. \nHOLDEN (looking out window) It's all about marketing.  Over- or underweight guys who don't get laid - they're our bread and butter.  People like those two outside should be yours. \nThrough the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the hood of a car. \nHOLDEN And sadly, there are more of our core audience out there than yours. (smiles) Look at that, though - kind of gives you a little charge, to see two people in love.  And all over Banky's car, no less.  That car's seeing more action right now than it's seen in years. \nALYSSA Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to figure out why. \nHOLDEN (still looking at OC Couple) You've gotta respect that kind of display of affection.  It's crazy, rude, self-absorbed - but it's love. \nALYSSA That's not love. \nHOLDEN Says you. \nALYSSA That out there!  That's fleeting. \nHOLDEN Fleeting. \nALYSSA Uh-huh.  You wanna hear about love! Oh, I'll tell you about love. \nHOLDEN A story? \nALYSSA The story.  The original love story. \nHOLDEN 'Doctor Zhivago'. \nALYSSA Nope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a millionaire. \nAlyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 'Everything's Archie' comic between them. \nBANKY You're insane.  Archie is not fucking Mister Weatherbee! \nHOOPER Deny, deny, deny. (to Holden) Where's Alyssa? \nHOLDEN Huh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd call you later. \nBANKY (off comic) He's just offering to help Archie with his homework! \nHOOPER Read between the lines. \nBANKY (shoves book at him) Fuck this. (to Holden) Let's go.  Traffic. (no response from Holden) Holden! \nHOLDEN (shaken) What! \nBANKY Let's go. \nHOOPER (looking out window) D'jou see that dent in the hood of your car! \nBANKY (looking out window) What the...!  Son of a bitch! \nBanky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper. \nHOOPER Let me guess: you like her! \nHOLDEN Who? \nHOOPER Miss Alyssa Jones. \nHOLDEN She's alright. \nHOOPER As long as that's all. (finishes drink) Maybe you can convince that partner of your's to drop me off downtown before you scurry out the tunnel! \nHOLDEN (beat) Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying to fuck Archie, was he! \nThey begin exiting. \nHOOPER Hell no.  Weatherbee was Reggie's bitch. \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nWe're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors and sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls, a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils, paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky. They're working.  Some music plays. \nC.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch- nemesis - the Giggler.  Holden erases a line and re- draws. \nC.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky outlining a pre-penciled page.  He traces Bluntman swinging from a street light. \nThe two work in silence.  Then... \nBANKY (not looking up) This is one of the best street lights you've ever drawn. \nHOLDEN It's the one across from the post office. \nBANKY Looks just like it. \nHOLDEN Thanks. (beat) What do you wanna do tonight! \nBANKY Get a pizza.  Watch 'Degrassi Junior High'. \nHOLDEN (brings his two pointer fingers together) We shared a moment.  And in that moment, one thing was made abundantly clear: this girl loves me, my friend. Loves-me. \n6.\tINT. HER-STERECTOMY - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t6. \nIt's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, it's loud.  But something's fishy.  Hooper's tending bar. He hands a GUY a drink.  The Guy sips it. \nGUY This is so watered down.  It's terrible.  Why is it you can never get a decent drink in these places! \nHooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion. \nGUY What are you doing! \nHOOPER Trying to find you a tissue. \nThe Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters. \nBANKY Alright - bring on the free hootch. \nHOOPER As long as you don't bitch about how little alcohol is in the drink. (hands Banky a drink; to Guy) You owe me five sixty. \nGUY (off Banky) And I suppose you're going to make your friend here pay for his drink right! \nBANKY Hey, I befriended a guy in a position of authority so I could abuse that authority and get free shit.  You want to do the same?  There's a lonely Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the street.  Get in tight with him. \nThe Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the bar. \nGUY I work at that '7-11'! (storms away) \nBANKY (calling after him) Wanna be friends! \nHOOPER Where's your better half! \nBANKY Taking a piss.  Guy's got a bladder like an infant. \nHOOPER That's funny - he says you're hung like an infant. \nBANKY Must his mother tell him everything! \nHolden enters. \nBANKY What'd you do - fall in love? \nHOLDEN Where is she? \nHOOPER Over there... \nON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people - dances Alyssa.  She moves like a cat and she's looking very sexy. \nOC HOOPER Been dancin' for an hour.  Hasn't stopped yet. \nHooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC. \nBANKY She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say that. \nHolden smacks Banky and moves to exit. \nHOOPER Wait. wait, wait - there's something you should know. \nHOLDEN She's got a boyfriend. \nHOLDEN You know what this is!  This is fate. \nALYSSA (regarding her move) No, this is the 'Rog'. \nHOLDEN I was talking about us meeting - what are the chances! \nALYSSA Pretty slim.  I haven't been back to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral. \nHOLDEN The Quick Stop girl died! \nALYSSA Another friend - Julie Dwyer.  She died in the.. \nHOLDEN Y.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her too! \nALYSSA So well. \nHOLDEN One friend in an asylum, the other friend in the grave.  You're a dangerous person to know. \nALYSSA But I can tap. (does an impromptu tap dance) That was the Buffalo Two-Step. \nHOLDEN Very solid. \nALYSSA That's what six years of tap lessons yields. \nHOLDEN Two towns away from each other for years and we had to meet in New York. \nThe Sand stops playing. People clap. \nALYSSA Coulda been worse - we could have not met at all. \nHolden looks at her. \nOC SINGER Thank you.  Thanks. \nThe SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone. \nSINGER A long time ago, we used to have this bass player who took off one day to draw funny books or something.  Maybe you've seen her stuff - it's called 'Idiosyncratic Routine'' \nThe crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her. \nSINGER But what a lot of people don't know is that she used to harbor these delusions that she could sing.  And she used to subject us to these throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes and shit, insisting that we let her front on a few numbers.  Well, we didn't and she quit.. and then she got famous, the bitch. (crowd laughs) But she's here tonight, and I think if we all begged, or maybe offered her some X, she'd get up here and treat us to some of her vocal stylings. (crowd applauds) What do you say, Alyssa? \nAlyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden pushes her forward. \nSINGER She's shy. (yelling) GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!! \nThe crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd \nBanky and Hooper stand at the bar. \nBANKY This is so queer. (he exits) \nHOOPER (beat) You don't know the half of it. \nAlyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.  She takes the mic, shaking her head.  The crowd is applauding. \nALYSSA She is such a twat. \nThe crowd cheers.  Alyssa laughs.  She turns to the band and says something which they nod.  She turns back to the crowd. \nThe Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely join in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' look. \nEXEC 1 Which brings us to our proposal: we are extremely interested in doing twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and Chronic' cartoons.  The age of Beavis is coming to a close, and we're looking for something... something... \nBANKY Even more retarded and juvenile to sate the voracious, intellectually- challenged miscreants that make up your key demographic. \nThe Execs laugh hard.  Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and gives the thumbs up. \nEXEC 1 (composes himself) So what do you say! Are we in business! \nBanky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in understanding. \nSLOSS Jim, Sean - could we have a few minutes! \nEXEC 2 (looks to Exec 1) Uh... absolutely.  We'll just.. \nEXEC 1 Uh...wait outside \nThe Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind then.  Sloss turns to Banky. \nSLOSS So?  Did I do good? \nBANKY You did better - you sold us out! \nThey clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience. \nSLOSS Do you know how much you'll make on merchandising alone! \nBANKY (as Simon Bar Sinister) Money and Power, and Money and Power... \nSLOSS (joins in) Money dnd Power, and Money and... \nHOLDEN (interrupting) I don't think it's a good idea. \nBanky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden. \nBANKY What's not a good idea!  Please don't say the cartoon, please don't say the cartoon... \nHOLDEN The cartoon. \nSLOSS What?!?  Are you out of your fucking mind! \nBANKY (getting up) John, let me handle this. ( to Holden) You are out of your fucking mind, aren't you! \nHOLDEN Is this how you want to be remembered! As the guy who created Bluntman and Chronic! \nBanky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through the guy's stuff. \nBANKY No, I'd like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created Bluntman and Chronic. \nHOLDEN But it'll be all glossy and main- stream.  We'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had. \nSLOSS (to Banky) Is it me!  I don't see the problem. \nBANKY (to Sloss) He just has to get over this crush of his. \nSLOSS Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again! (to Holden) Holden - she's not really a Princess. \nBANKY (opening drawer with a letter opener) Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the chick that does that comic book 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  You ever seen it? \nALYSSA Aren't there some men that you find attractive?  Granted, not enough to sleep with, but still - just handsome or something! \nHOLDEN Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail- man. \nALYSSA Well it's the same thing.  I look at you and just find you really handsome. And you know, it has very little to do with your look, per-se.  Your look is fine, don't get me wrong.  But it's more your outlook.  The things you say, the way you see things.  It's... I don't know... attractive, \nHolden looks away, embarrassed, \nALYSSA I weirded you our the other night \nHOLDEN Huh!  No, not really. \nALYSSA Come on. \nHOLDEN (beat) It's just that we've.., I mean, I've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal.  It just took awhile to process, longer than usual. \nALYSSA Do you want to talk about it! \nHOLDEN Um.  If you want to. \nALYSSA I like you.  I haven't liked a man in a long time.  And I'm not a man-hater or something.  It's just been some time since I've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort.  And I want you to feel comfortable with me, because I want us to be friends.  So if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me. \nHOLDEN (beat) Why girls? \nALYSSA (beat) Why men? \nHOLDEN Because that's the standard \nALYSSA If that's the only reason you're attracted to women - because it's the standard.. \nHOLDEN It's more than that. \nALYSSA So you've never been curious about men? \nHOLDEN Curious about men?  Well... I always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'. \nALYSSA You know what I mean. \nHOLDEN No. \nALYSSA Why not! \nHOLDEN No interest. \nALYSSA Because...? \nHOLDEN Girls feel right. \nALYSSA And that's how I feel.  I've never really been attracted to men.  I'm more comfortable with the idea of girls. \nHOLDEN Wait, wait, wait - you're still a virgin? \nALYSSA No. \nHOLDEN But you've only been with girls. \nALYSSA You're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex? \nHOLDEN Isn't that the standard definition? \nALYSSA Come on. \nHOLDEN Just...uh... just give me a moment. \nINT AIRPORT - DAY \nHolden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage. \nHOLDEN Look at you.  It's a two day trip. \nBANKY I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes in the other, and two months worth of unread comics in this one. \nHOLDEN We're going to a convention, for the love of God.  We'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day. When are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit?  In fact, fuck it - you're leaving some of this shit here in a locker.  Come on - give me the two that aren't clothes. \nBANKY Hold on. (starts rifling through one bag) \nHOLDEN What are you doing? \nBANKY I just have to get something. (pulls out a huge stack of porno books) \nHOLDEN Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt? What are you going to do with all of those? \nBANKY Read the articles.  What do you think I'm going to do with them?  They're stroke books. \nHOLDEN You've got like thirty books there! We're only there for two days! \nBANKY (leafing through mags) Variety's the spice of life.  I like a wide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed.  Some times it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.  Sometimes a steamy letter will do it, sometimes - not often, but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse. \nA beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper. \nHOLDEN Go check us in.  I've gotta call Alyssa. \nBANKY His master's voice. \nHOLDEN Put that stuff away. \nHolden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A little KID enters, staring at him. \nKID What are those? \nBANKY (looks at kid then books) Do you Like horsies? \nHolden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him and Alyssa at home. \nALYSSA I hope for the sake of the women you've dated that you're only this quick in returning calls. \nHOLDEN What's up?  I'm about to get on a plane. \nALYSSA Ohhh.  Why! \nHOLDEN Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'. \nALYSSA Shit. \nHOLDEN What? \nALYSSA My sister's at my parents'.  I was gonna go see her. \nHOLDEN The one that wrote the book? \nHOLDEN Excuse me? \nWOMAN You've got it in your head that Alyssa's not really into chicks - that she just hasn't met the right man. And you believe you're it.  You're going to treat her right, fuck her like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her back from the land of the lost.  And the sad truth is that you'll accomplish none of that and wind up as either an even more bitter misogynist or a reverse fag-hag. \nHolden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman, carrying an overnight bag. \nALYSSA Don't mind her.  That's just her way a saying hello. \nWOMAN Actually, it's just my way of saying \"Give it up.\" \nALYSSA (to Woman) You're such an asshole. \nWOMAN When you file the date-rape charges, don't say I didn't warn you. \nHOLDEN (holding out hand) I'm Holden, by the way. \nWOMAN I'm the voice of reason that Miss Bitch is having such a hard time listening to. \nHOLDEN Look, we're just friends. \nWOMAN That's what every guy says before he tries purring your hand on his dick. \nHOLDEN And how do you know men so well? \nWOMAN Because I lapdance for a living, dick- head. \nShe slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa. \nALYSSA Ohhh - you look so cute! \nShe heads down the stairs. \nHOLDEN Who was that? \nALYSSA Just an occasional friend. \nHOLDEN Why would you want to hang our with someone bitter as that? \nALYSSA (stops) Remember this! (sticks out huge tongue) Her's is even bigger than that. \nShe smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the door.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his fingers. \nEXT TURNPIKE - DAY \nThe car sits in traffic. \nINT CAR - DAY \nHolden sighs.  Alyssa plays with the radio. \nALYSSA You were raised Catholic, right? \nHOLDEN Yeah.  You? \nALYSSA Baptist. \nHOLDEN Really?  Did you have a strict upbringing? \nALYSSA Please There was no time to be bad - we were too busy saying 'Jesus'. \nHOLDEN (off game) What?  Do something! \nBANKY (off game) You fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass. \nHOLDEN Look at how slow you are.  Christ, you move like a geriatric. \nBANKY (screaming at screen) Fuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man! These faggots won't do what I tell them to! \nHOLDEN Oh. It's the controller, right?  It's always the controller. \nBANKY No, it's these... fucking queers on blades that can't accept a fucking pass to save their lives!  What period is this? \nHOLDEN Final sixty of the third. \nBANKY Fuck!  Look at your fucking guys, they... FUCK!!! (whips controller) FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!  I SWEAR TO GOD! \nBanky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden, \nHOLDEN Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one instead of thirty. \nINT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY \nHolden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine. Alyssa looks on. \nALYSSA Explain this again. \nHOLDEN How could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee-ball? What did you do with your youth? \nThey head toward the skee-ball runs. \nALYSSA Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around. \nHOLDEN Not your grade school years; your high school years. \nALYSSA (off skee-ball run) This looks complicated. \nHOLDEN (Inserts coin and pulls lever) The premise is very basic - you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles.  The higher the score, the more prize tickets you get. \nALYSSA What do you do with the prize tickets? \nHOLDEN Trade them in for prizes that aren't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game. \nALYSSA Then what's the point? \nHOLDEN It's fun. \nALYSSA And you question my lifestyle. \nHOLDEN Observe. \nHolden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point circle. \nHOLDEN See?  It's just that simple. \nALYSSA Why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time? \nHOLDEN Where's the skill in that? \nALYSSA Oh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had no idea. \nALYSSA But you know what? (picks up his face) I have more faith in you than that. (rips her tickets off) Come on - I want my cheap prize. \nINT STUDIO - NIGHT \nHolden enters.  Banky's still playing Sega.  Holden sits next to him. \nHOLDEN (off screen) How bad do you suck! \nBANKY How was your pseudo-date? \nHOLDEN Leave it alone. \nBANKY That chick bugs me. \nHOLDEN (rubs his head; in baby-talk) Aww.  Everyone bugs you. \nBANKY Get off. (off game) Fucking faggot!  Did you see that?! Your dyke courting ass just got me scored on! \nHOLDEN (beat) You know, you should watch that.  If you're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game, so much so that you need to curse the t.v., try not to gay-bash it, alright. You're nor that kind of guy. (gets up) And don't call her a dyke, alright? She's a lesbian. \nHolden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat. Banky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table. \nBANKY What the fuck is going on here? \nHOLDEN (pulling out pencil) I'm starting a new page. \nBANKY (smacking pencil away) Not with this shit!  With you.  What the fuck is going on with you and that girl? \nHOLDEN We're friends. \nBANKY She's programming you. \nHOLDEN I beg your pardon?  Programming? \nBANKY Yeah.  And apparently, you don't even realize it.  What does it matter if I refer to her as a dyke, or if I call the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office, far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world? \nHOLDEN It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; and I know you're not really prejudiced at heart.  You should just find some other way to express your anger, is all I'm saying. \nHolden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to the side.  He starts drawing something. \nHOLDEN What the fuck are you doing! \nBANKY Bear with me here.  I just want to put you through this little exercise. (drawing feverishly) Okay, now see this?  This is a four way road, okay? \nBanky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to his voice-over. \nBANKY V.O. And dead in the center, is a crisp, new, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the end of each of the streets, are four people, okay?  You following?  Up here, we got a male-affectionate, easy- to-get-along-with, no political agenda lesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.  To this side, we got Santa Claus, right?  And over to this side - the Easter Bunny. \nBanky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head \nBANKY Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first? \nHOLDEN What is this supposed to prove? \nBANKY I'm serious.  This is a serious exercise.  It's like an S.A.T. question.  Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first - the male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter Bunny? \nHOLDEN (beat; then pissed) The man-hating dyke. \nBANKY Good.  Why? \nShe walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he turns and heads back to his car. As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her. \nAnd there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing. \nEXT STUDIO - DAY \nBanky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the door.  He picks up the mail on the floor. \nINT STUDIO - DAY \nHe closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail. He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats. Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus.  They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. \nALYSSA (off Holden's reaction) I take it that's not good. \nHOLDEN (getting up) Stay here. (he kisses her and exits) \nEXT STREET - DAY \nBanky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden saunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's gaze. \nBANKY Catholic school girls. \nAcross the street, the Catholic High School is letting out.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters smoke, frolic, wait for their bus. \nBANKY The uniform is what does it for me.  I wish I'd have went with more Catholic school girls when I was a kid.  As it stands.  I have no \"...and then she unzipped her jumper...\" stories. \nHOLDEN You looked weirded out back there. \nBANKY That's my couch you were fucking on. \nHOLDEN Sorry. \nBANKY I wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch. \nHOLDEN She had boxers on. \nBanky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the OC girls. \nBANKY This is all going to end badly. \nHOLDEN You don't know that. \nBANKY I know you.  You're way too conservative for that girl.  She's been around and seen things we've only read about in books. \nHOLDEN But we have read about them.  So we're prepared. \nBANKY There's no 'we' here.  You're going to have to go through this alone.  And it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis. When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside.  You'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop.  Because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love. \nHOLDEN Maybe it is for her as well. \nBANKY Somehow I doubt it. \nHOLDEN Everyone's not out to get someone in life.  Bank. \nBANKY Everybody has an agenda.  Everyone. \nHOLDEN Yourself? \nBANKY My agenda is to watch your back. \nAll four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.  She stops painting. \nJANE Oh, Alyssa - no.  Not you. \nTORY You're dating a guy? \nALYSSA He's not like a typical man.  He's really sweet to me, and we relate so well.  You guys'd love him, really. \nThey stare at Alyssa.  Then Dalia gets up. \nDALIA I've gotta go to the store. \nJANE I'll go with. \nThey exit.  Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica. \nTORY (pouring wine) Whelp - here's to both of you. (moves the glass to her lips) Another one bites the dust. \nINT HOLDEN'S BEDROOM -NIGHT \nHolden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them.  She smokes. \nHOLDEN Can I ask you something? \nALYSSA Don't even tell me you want to do it again. \nHOLDEN Why me - you know?  Why now? \nALYSSA Because you were giving me that look, and I got wet... \nHOLDEN You know what I'm talking about. \nALYSSA Why not You? \nHOLDEN I'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls. \nALYSSA I see you've been taking notes. Historically, yes  that's true. \nHOLDEN Then why this? \nALYSSA I've given that a lot of thought, you know?  I mean, now that I'm being ostracized by my friends, I've had a lot of time to think about all of this.  And what I've come up with is really simple: I came to this on my terms.  I didn't just heed what I was taught, you  know?  Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing.  I'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one.  The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare.   My parents didn't really have it.  There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships.  And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. So I didn't.  And by leaving my options open, I was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know?  They define what you do, not who you are, I guess. But \t\tthen you come along.  You - the one least likely; I mean, you were a guy. \nHOLDEN Still am. \nALYSSA And while I was falling for you, I put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. Until I remembered why I opened the door to women in the first place - to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely.  And so here we are, I was thorough when I looked for you, and I feel justified lying in your arms - because I got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace I didn't look.  And that makes all the difference. \nHOLDEN (beat) Shit. \nALYSSA What? \nHOLDEN Well, you took the luster our of it. \nALYSSA What luster? \nHOLDEN (joking - in case you didn't get it) Of how I brought you back from the other side.  How all you needed was the right man to turn you around. \nALYSSA You're not the right man. (kisses him) You're just the one. \nShe snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares at the ceiling. \nBANKY That's what she says.  But I say her on her hands and knees getting filled out like an application constitutes 'being with a guy'. \nHOLDEN He's pulling your chain.  And the fact that you even bought it for a second makes you look like an idiot. \nBANKY I'm getting your back, asshole! People don't forget shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.  And if it got out that she's queer as well, how do you think it's going to make you look? \nHOLDEN I give a shit what people think. \nBANKY Alright, forget about that; what if she's carrying a disease?  That was just one story - what if there's more? \nHOLDEN (grabs his coat) You're such a fucking asshole. \nBANKY What?  Oh, it's not possible that she's all crudded up?  Cohee I can vouch for as clean - the dude never got laid in high school.  But Derris is an arch fucking bush-man!  Name me one chick in our senior class that Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's sake! \nHOLDEN Would you let this go?  I'm telling you - she's never even been with a guy, let alone those two zeroes. \nBANKY And I'm telling you, the bitch could be a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in 'Outbreak'! \nHolden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall. \nHOLDEN Give it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm tired of this shit!  She's my goddamn girlfriend, do you understand?!  Show her a little fucking respect! And if you ever even so much as mention that Alyssa looks a little peaked from now on, I'll put your fucking teeth down your throat! \nHe releases Banky.  Banky brushes himself off. \nBANKY Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down your throat. \nHOLDEN (walking out) Not bloody Likely. \nBanky runs to the open door. \nBANKY (calling after him) I've been working out you know! (no response) You better be ready to make that M-TV deal! \nThe downstairs door slams.  Banky makes a muscle, then feels it. \nINT TOWER RECORDS - DAY \nHolden and Hooper peruse laser discs. \nHOOPER Where's that bitch partner of your's been? \nHOLDEN Sulking.  He's having a real problem with this Alyssa thing. \nHOOPER I think it's more like Banky's having a problem with all things not hetero right about now.  And I'm just another paradigm of said aberration. \nHOLDEN Banky does not hate gays, you know that. \nHOOPER But I do think he is a bit homophobic. And this latest episode between you and Ms. Thing has tapped into that. In his warped perception, he lost you to the dark side - which is she. \nHOLDEN You make it sound like me and him were dating. \nHOOPER Don't kid yourself - that boy loves you in a way that he's not ready to deal with. \nHOLDEN (beat) He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa. \nHOOPER And just what has Mister Angela Lansbury uncovered about your lady fair? \nHOLDEN He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys. \nHOOPER Really?  Well then he's barking up the wrong we if he wants to split you up, isn't he?  He's not going to make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay she's not (holds up a disc) This one? \nHOOPER Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect.  What is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world. (shakes his head) As for this hang-up with Alyssa's past, maybe what's really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true. \nHOLDEN What do you mean? \nHOOPER Holden - don't even try to come off like you don't know what I'm saying. Men need to believe that they're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory.  And it's hard not to let them believe it.  I let my boys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that \"I've never done this before...\" bullshit, and let 'em labor under the delusion that they rockin' my world, until I can't stand them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the truth.  It's a sick game.  The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there. \nHOLDEN I can accept that. \nHOOPER Honey, that almost sounded convincing. Do yourself a favor - just ask her about her past, point blank.  Get it out of the way, before it gets too big for both ya'll to move. (spotting something OC) Oooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'! \nHooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do Girls - All XXX Action.' \nINT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT \nOn the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and back, checking galore. \nIn the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches the game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm. \nALYSSA Since most of these people are rooting for the home team, I'm going to cheer for the visitors.  I'm a big visitors fan - especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go. (smiles at Holden; no response) That was a joke.  A little wacky wordplay? \nHOLDEN What do you mean, 'visitors'? \nALYSSA Was I being too obscure?  The kind that - until recently - had no dicks and would spend the night. \nHOLDEN So that was until recently! \nALYSSA Oh, yeah. (shouting; to ice) Hey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling or something! \nHOLDEN So nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together? \nALYSSA (beat) Something on your mind, Holden? \nHOLDEN No, I was just wondering, \nALYSSA If I've been 'faithful' or something? \nHOLDEN Look, I was just asking. \nALYSSA (toucher his face) Oh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for you. (to ice) CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!  THE GUY ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY GUYS!! (to Holden) I told you I was great at sporting events.  Imagine what a bitch I could be if I knew what was going on? \nON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS. One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off. The other Player gives chase. \nAlyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head \nHOLDEN That'd make Banky half right. \nALYSSA About what? \nHOLDEN He said all the girls from North were bitches and sluts. \nALYSSA Really.  I'm sorry - you two left high school behind how many years ago? (grabs his face and kisses his cheek) Can I put some of my books in your locker? (goes back to watching game) \nHOLDEN (under his breath) How about your yearbook. \nON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player with the puck. \nAlyssa jumps to her feet. \nALYSSA (to ice) IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR ASS!! (to guy next to her) Right? \nHolden rubs his eyes. \nJAY You're dating Finger Cuffs?  Wait a minute I thought she was all gay and shit! \nHOLDEN She is.  Or was.  I don't know. \nThe Waitress returns with the order. \nJAY And you go out with her?  Shit, man - you're a lucky dog.  She bring other chicks to bed with you, get a little of that filet o' fish sammich going on? \nThe Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay. \nJAY (off the Waitress' look) Yeah - you know what I'm talking about, baby. (Waitress  leaves;  to Holden) So - four tits, or what? \nHOLDEN It's not like that. \nJAY Well what's it like then? \nHOLDEN Right now? (beat) I don't know.  I love her.  But she has a past \nJAY I'll say.  Stuffin' two guys, eating chicks out.  Yo - I heard one time, she had this dog... \nHOLDEN Eat your fucking bagel already! \nJAY (to Silent Bob) Look at this touchy mother fucker right here. (to Holden) So, if you're all in love with her, what's the problem? \nHOLDEN The problem is shit like that.  It was one thing when it was just girls - that was weird enough.  But now you throw guys into the mix - two guys at once, no less.  All that experience...What am I supposed to think? \nJAY You think good; because now she'll be all true blue and shit.  The girl's tasted life, yo.  Now she's settlin' for your boring, funny-book-makin' ass. \nHOLDEN Settling.  That's comforting, Jay. Thanks. \nJAY That's what I'm here for. \nHOLDEN I'm lust having a problem with all of it I can't get it out of my head these visuals of her doing all this shit. And I don't know why I can't let it go.  Because I'm crazy about her, you know?  I look at this girl, I see the future.  I see kids.  I see grand- kids. \nJAY You're scaring me. \nHOLDEN I'm scaring myself.  Because I think so much of her,  and then I can't get over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'. (shakes his head) I don't know what I'm doing. \nHolden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his joint.  There's silence. Then... \nBOB You're chasing Amy. \nHolden's head snaps forward.  He stares, wide-eyed at Silent Bob. \nHOLDEN What..what did you say? \nBOB You're chasing Amy. \nHolden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still rolling his joint. \nJAY What do you look so shocked for?  He does this all the time.  Fat bastard thinks just because he never says anything, that it'll have some huge impact when he does open his fucking mouth. \nBOB Why don't you shut up?  Jesus!  Always yap, yap, yapping all the time.  Give me a fucking headache. (to Holden) I went through something like what you're going through.  Years ago. Same kind of thing with a girl named Amy. \nJAY When? \nBOB A couple of years ago. \n4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him. \n5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, angrily. \n6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He jumps up and dashes out of the park. \nINT STUDIO - NIGHT \nBanky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front of them. \nHOLDEN I know you're wondering why I asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately. \nBANKY I just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on. \nALYSSA Fuck you. \nBANKY Not even if you let me videotape it. \nHOLDEN Enough! (they both look at him) I've been going through things, over and over.  And I dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways.  Banky - there's friction between us for the first time in our lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this M-TV thing. \nBANKY How perceptive. \nHOLDEN Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because I don't know how to deal with... your past, I guess. \nBANKY That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd have said the whole double-stuff thing... \nHOLDEN (right in his face) I'm only going to say it once: shut up. (back to pacing) Now - I know I'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts.  With you, Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel inadequate.  Because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison. \nALYSSA That doesn't matter to me... \nHOLDEN Please.  I have to get through this. (beat) And with you Banky - I know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but I guess I just didn't acknowledge it. (takes a deep breath) You're in love with me. \nBANKY (makes a face; beat) What? \nHOLDEN You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it makes sense - we've been together so long, we have so much in common... \nBANKY (getting up) Well, I've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', so I'll be... \nHolden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed and speechless - looks away. \nHOLDEN It's something you're going to have to deal with.  Bank.  You may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, and your sense of humor as well. \nBANKY Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes... \nHOLDEN Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll feel much better. \nHe grabs a chair from the side of the room. \nHOLDEN Now - at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that I've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other? \nAlyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head. \nALYSSA (under her breath) Don't. \nHOLDEN And when I did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me.  I know what we have to do.  And then you - Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... can finally be... alright. \nALYSSA (again, under her breath) Please don't say it. \nHOLDEN (sits in the chair; takes a long beat) We've all got to have sex together. \nBanky sits at his own signing table.  Behind him hangs a banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'. A small line is formed in front of him.  He talks with a FAN. \nFAN Do you know how much it's going for these days?  One ten.  You signing it will push that up even higher, \nBANKY If you sell it, I want a kickback (starts signing) \nFAN I don't know if this is true, but I heard once that there was going to be an animated series. \nBANKY There was going to be \nFAN What happened! \nBANKY (off comic) You're looking at it.  No Chronic - no cartoon \nFAN That sucks man.  That would've been awesome. \nBANKY Tell me about it \nFAN Is that what happened to you and Holden McNeil?  You got into a fight over the rights or something? \nBANKY It was a little more involved than that. \nFAN Whatever happened to him? \nBANKY He quit the biz.  I guess. \nFAN You guys don't talk anymore? \nBANKY (looks OC) No.  Not really. \nBanky locks eyes with someone OC.  His expression softens. \nHolden leans against a wall on the far side of the room. He smiles at Banky.  Banky smiles back, and sort of nods. \nHolden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.  He points to it and gives a thumbs up. \nOC FAN Probably shouldn't have killed off Chronic. \nBanky smiles to OC. \nBANKY Guess not.  Some doors just shouldn't be opened. \nBanky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden and points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, and then looks back at Banky and nods. \nOC FAN You don't need that guy, anyway.  You do great stuff without him. \nBanky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his pointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared moment' gesture. \nHolden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if to say 'hopefully'. \nOC FAN You were just carrying that guy, anyway. \nBanky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'. \nBANKY (to fan, still looking OC) You're so right. \nHolden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off. \nOC FAN Well, keep up the good work, man. Love them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See ya. \n", "test1_input": "ALYSSA Yes? \nBANKY You said 'fuck'.  To that girl.  You said you'd 'fuck' her. \nALYSSA And? \nBANKY How can a girl 'fuck' another girl! Were you talking about strap-ons or something? \nHOLDEN (hits him) Would you shut up!! \nBANKY What!!?  It's a valid question.  You know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse Letters section is written by guys - this is our chance to get the inside scoop. \nHOLDEN (to Alyssa) I don't know how many times I can apologize for him. \nALYSSA It's okay.  Secretly, all I really want is to be the center of attention. (to Banky) I've never used a snap-on. \nBANKY Then what's with saying 'fuck? Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at least modify the term 'fuck' with something like 'fist'? \nALYSSA Let me ask you a question - can men 'fuck' each other! \nBANKY Ask Hooper. \nALYSSA In your estimation. \nBANKY Sure. \nALYSSA So for you, to 'fuck' means to penetrate.  You're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you've duped, jack-hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes. \nBANKY Hey - I always notice the bored look in their eyes. \nALYSSA (laughs) 'Fucking' is nor limited to penetration, Banky. For me it describes any sex when it's not totally about love.  I don't love Kim, but I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with. \nBANKY Some of them I downright loathe. \nALYSSA But I'll bet it's different with the ones you love.  I'll bet you go the full nine when it's not just a quick fix - like you go down on them longer or something. \nHOLDEN Here we go. \nBANKY I don't do that. \nALYSSA What?!?! \nBANKY I stopped dropping.  It got to be too frustrating. \nHOLDEN As stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of your's, you're going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion. \nBANKY What?!  I lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out.  What's the big deal?! \nALYSSA If you say the smell, so help me, I'll slug you. \nBANKY Not the smell - the smell is good. I'm talking about not being able to do it property.  And my mother brought me up to believe that if I can't do something right I shouldn't do it at all.  Of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the point. \nALYSSA At least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies. \nBANKY No, I blame them.  Chicks never help you out.  They never tell you what to do.  And most of them are self- conscious about that smell factor, and so most of the time they just lay there, frozen like a deer in the headlights, right?  Not for nothing, but when a chick goes down on me.  I let her know where to go, and what the status is.  You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel - constant updates. \nHOLDEN You're such an idiot. \nALYSSA No, he's got a point.  That's how I was in high school - I was nervous, and inhibited about being eaten out. But by the time I got to college, that all changed.  I loosened up.  Not only did I learn to communicate - I learned to be bossy. I was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights - waving them this way, directing them that way, telling them when to stop. \n", "test1_true": "ALYSSA Permanent injuries? \nBANKY Sure.  You wanna see something permanent! (pulls our front tooth) I got this from Nina Rollins, sophomore year.  I'm going down on her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her stomach.  She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat.  I had to get a crown for the stub. \nALYSSA (to Holden) I got that beat. (to Banky) I got that beat. (half-turns and lifts chin) Sophomore year.  I'm going down on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after we went club-hopping.  I'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall asleep - right there in her lap.  She got so mad, she digs her heel into my back, right there. (points to scar) That's permanent. \nBANKY You see this! (moves neck slightly right) That's the farthest I can move my neck to the right Sophomore year, I'm going out with Maria Bennert, and for six months, I'm going down on her, and not a damn thing's happening. Then one night, I change a position, or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly it's a whole new world.  She's moving around, convulsing, breathing heavy. And her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that I don't hear her father come into the room.  He grabs my hair... (grabs his own hair and pulls back) ...and he pulls me way back, hard. \nALYSSA (throws up her leg, and rolls up pants) Senior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's car.  She's laying across the back seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the car, my knees on the ground.  She's flailing around, and she knocks the parking brake off.  The car starts rolling down the hill, and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy's scissor class cut it up for paper dolls. \nBanky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck. \nHOLDEN (off Banky's watch) Holy shit, is that the time.  We've gotta beat traffic. \nBANKY What traffic - it's one thirty in the morning! \nHOLDEN (getting up) And rush hour starts in six hours. Let's go. (to Alyssa) Thanks for inviting us out.  It was... educational. \nAlyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the booth. \nBANKY (to Kim) Since you like chicks, right.. do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time? \nHolden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim. \nINT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY \nHolden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks up another one and then repeats the whole process.  A Receptionist types. \nBANKY (off Holden's look) You're still dwelling on the dyke, aren't you? \nHOLDEN Lower your voice. \nBANKY What'd I tell you - she just needs the right guy.  All every woman really wants - be it mother, senator, nun - is some serious deep-dicking. \nThe Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked. \nBANKY (off her look) Don't give me that look - I heard Adam Curry say worse. \nThe Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at Holden. \nBANKY That's why I can't buy lesbians. Everyone needs dick.  See, I can buy fags.  Bunch of guys that need dick - just plain need it?  That I get. Dykes?  Bullshit posturing.  But - live and let live, I guess. \nHOLDEN I'm sure the gay community appreciates your support. \nJOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them. \nSLOSS Please tell me you haven't blown this deal already. \nBANKY Sloss like a mother fucker. (slaps his hand) \nSLOSS Hey, every mother but your's - a shyster's gotta have his standards. Shall we? \nINT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches across from our trio. \nEXEC 1 We just want to start off by saying that it's a pleasure to finally meet you.  While it's been - shall we say - an experience dealing with Sloss here, one of the main reasons we started this whole thing was to meet the guys that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'. \nEXEC 2 (points at them) 'Snootchie Bootchies'. \n", "test2_input": "ALYSSA Are you an authorized deal-maker in this establishment?  Do you have the power to negotiate. \nCASHIER You wanna haggle over the price of your French Dip? \nALYSSA I want to haggle over the price of fine art. \nCASHIER What do you mean? \nALYSSA (pointing OC) There.  By the kitchen.  That painting. \nCASHIER What about it? \nALYSSA The price tag says seventy five. \nCASHIER So! \nHOLDEN (to Alyssa) Tell me you're kidding! \nALYSSA I'll give you fifty. \nCASHIER (to OC) Manuel!  Bring, me the Dyksiezski off the wall. (to Alyssa) All my years in the diner business, I've waited for this day - the day when someone wanted to buy one of the pictures. \nALYSSA (holds out hand) Alyssa Jones.  Pleased to meet you. \nCASHIER You say you want to haggle, but you don't know rule one about haggling, which you just broke: you never give your name.  The name is power, and to give the opponent that piece of you is to give away victory. \nALYSSA I'm only trying to conduct a transaction.  We're not opponents. \nCASHIER (accepting painting from BUSBOY) Oh, but we are - if you think I'm letting this beautiful piece go for fifty. \nALYSSA Ah-ha! (to Holden) Now we're haggling. \n24.    INT CAR - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24. \nIt's drizzling outside.  Holden drives.  Alyssa hugs her painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield, making footprints. \nHOLDEN I've always wondered what kind of people buy those things.  I can't believe you talked him down to twenty five! \nALYSSA It was looking shakey when he told me the artist was a blind cripple with a hump-back, but I held my ground. There's no room for sympathy in the buyer's market. \nHOLDEN Where are you going to hang it? \nALYSSA I'm not.  You are. \nHOLDEN You want me to hang it for you?  You better hope it doesn't get out to the girl-nation that you needed a man to help you hang a picture. \nALYSSA You're going to hang it in your house. I bought it for you. \nHOLDEN (laughs) Yeah, right. \nALYSSA (looks at him) I'm serious. \nHolden stares at her. \nHOLDEN Why? \nALYSSA Because it's captured the moment. It'll be a constant reminder - not just of tonight, but of our introduction, the building of our friendship, everything.  Make no mistake about it my Friend - it's a gift to you, from me, so you'll always remember us. \nHolden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the right. \n", "test2_true": "The car pulls to the side of the road.  The rain is a bit heavier now. \nINT CAR - NIGHT \nHolden throws the car into park \nALYSSA Why are we stopping? \nHOLDEN Because I can't take it. \nALYSSA Can't take what? \nHOLDEN I love you. \nALYSSA (beat) You love me. \nHOLDEN I love you.  And not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends.  And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it.  And it's not because you're unattainable. I love you.  Very simple, very truly. You're the epitome of every attribute and quality I've ever looked for in another person.  I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider.  But I can't do this any longer.  I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you.  I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.  I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this before, and I like who I am because of it.  And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me.  But I couldn't allow another \tday to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot- down.  And I'll accept that But I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too.  All I ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it. There isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it's there between you and me. You can't deny that.  And even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that I'm forever changed because of you and what you've meant to me, which - while I do appreciate it - I'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of. \nHolden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets out of the car. \nHOLDEN Was it something I said? \nEXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT \nHolden gets out of the car.  It's raining pretty hard now.  Alyssa's hitching up the road.  Holden reaches her. \nHOLDEN What are you doing? \nALYSSA Get back in the car and get out of here. \nHOLDEN You're going to hitch to New York? \nALYSSA Y'ep. \nHOLDEN Aren't you at least going to comment? \nALYSSA Here's my comment fuck you. \nHOLDEN Why? \nALYSSA That was so unfair.  You know how unfair that was. \nHOLDEN It's unfair that I'm in love with you? \nALYSSA No, it's unfortunate that you're in love with me.  It's  unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden your soul about it.  Do you remember for a fucking second who I am? \nHOLDEN So?  People change. \nALYSSA Oh, it's that simple?  You fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky- dorey all the time.  But what about- me?  It's not that simple, is it?  I can't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval! \nHOLDEN But that's every relationship! There's always going to be a period of adjustment. \nALYSSA Period of adjustment?!? (hitting him) THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT' HOLDEN!  I'M FUCKING GAY!  THAT'S WHO I AM!  AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CRUSH?!? \nHOLDEN If this is a crush... then I don't know if I could take the real thing if it ever happens. \nShe looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes her head ruefully. \nALYSSA Go home, Holden. \n", "test3_input": "INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nAlyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.  Holden catches up to her.  We track with them our into the parking lot. \nHOLDEN So it's true?! \nALYSSA Yes Holden!  In fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true!  Yeah, I took on two guys at once!  You want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed - I took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo!  And the girl who got caught in the shower with Miss Moffit, the gym teacher?  That was me! Or how about in college, when I let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex - only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station?!  They're all true - those and so many more!  Didn't you know?  I'm the queen of urban legend! \nHOLDEN How the hell could you do those things?! \nALYSSA Easily!  Some of it I did out of stupidity, some of it I did out of what I thought was love, but - good or bad - they were my choices, and I'm not making apologies for them now - not to you or anyone!  And how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it - in public, no less!  Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick?! \nHOLDEN How am I supposed to feel about all of this? \nALYSSA How are you supposed to feel about it? Feel what ever the fuck you want about it!  The only thing that really matters is how you feel about me. \nHOLDEN I don't know how I feel about you now. \nALYSSA Why?  Because I had some sex? \nHOLDEN Some sex? \nALYSSA Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some sex!  Most of it stupid high school sex, for Christ's sake!  Like you never had sex in high school! \nHOLDEN There's a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once!  They fucking used you? \nALYSSA I used them!  You don't think I would've let it happen if I hadn't wanted it to, do you?!  I was an experimental girl, for Christ's sake! Maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but unlike you I wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so I tried it all!  That is until we - that's you and I - got together, and suddenly, I was sated. Can't you take some fucking comfort in that?  You turned out to be all I was ever looking for - the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle! (tries to calm down) Look I'm sorry I let you believe that you were the only guy I'd ever been with.  I should've been more honest. But it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across. \nShe touches his face.  He pulls back.  She stares at him, hurt and pissed. \nALYSSA Do you mean to tell me that - while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in New York City - you have some sort of half-assed, mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent antics, that took place almost ten years ago?  What the fuck is your problem?!? \nHolden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response. \nHOLDEN I want us to be something that we can't. \nALYSSA And what's that? \nHOLDEN (beat) A normal couple. \nHolden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally slumping to the ground.  She cries. \nINT STUDIO - DUSK \nHolden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.  The door opens and Banky enters.  He stands there, sizing up Holden's mood. \nBANKY The girl? \nHolden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a beat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms. Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying on his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a man in pain and the comfort of a friend. \nINT DINER - NIGHT \nHolden sits alone at a booth.

You bring the salad? \nHolden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it to Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.' \nJAY Man, this likeness rights shit is more profitable than selling smoke. \nHOLDEN How'd a dirt merchant like you ever learn about likeness rights? \nJAY (hands envelope to Silent Bob) We deal to a lot of lawyers.  Speaking of which... (pulls out a dime bag) Little signing bonus and shit! \nHOLDEN I'll pass.  Take a look at the issue. \nSilent Bob thumbs through the comic.  Jay looks over his shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint. \nJAY Yeah.  When you gonna get some pussy in that book, man!  Throw some super- villain in with big fucking tits that shoot milk or something, and I just drink her dry, bust some moves on her... (demonstrates) ...and then she has to fuck me.

I get that a lot. \nHOLDEN No.  I'm just at a point where I don't know what to do. \nJAY Kick her to the curb.  Girls get to be too much trouble, there's always the 'band of the hand'. \nHOLDEN Can't do it, g.  I'm in love. \nJAY Ah, there ain't no such thing.  You gotta boil it all down to the essentials.  It's like Cube says - life ain't nothing but bitches and money. \nHOLDEN Just what I needed - advice from the 'hood \nJAY Who is this girl? \nHOLDEN I don't think you know her. \nJAY Come on man - I'm people who know people. \nHOLDEN You sound like Barbra Streisand. \nJAY That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch playing her greatest hits tape in my ear all the time.

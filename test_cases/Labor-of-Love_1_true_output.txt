ADELLE I can't believe it. 
TV ANCHOR Whatever has carried Mr. Parker through snow and rain and thousands of miles of this countryside, will have to carry him through the most dangerous part of his trek... The three hundred miles through the sweltering roads of Nevada... 
ADELLE My God.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY 
A merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway.  The black tar from the road melting slightly. 
No sign of Maurice.  WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in sight.  WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road. There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an overhanging rock formation. 
Maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on his shoulder bag.  He is fast asleep. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DUSK 
The SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding behind the horizon.  Like an alarm went off, Maurice wakes up and packs his things. 
CUT TO: 
ROAD 
The MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by step with a walking stick. 
The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE.  Maurice turns to see a wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road. They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.  Maurice walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAWN 
THE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.  Maurice looks bad.  He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep incline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment. 
He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep. 
Maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there. 
Maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty five feet above the ground. 
CUT TO: 
MID-DAY 
Another sizzler.  Temperatures in the nineties.  The sun is directly overhead. 
Maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the rock. 
A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK... A SLIGHT TREMOR... THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK... 
Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping at the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for panic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt, clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes. 
Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the first few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic. 
Maurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest, before working his way to his feet. 
CUT TO: 
HIGHWAY 
Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a seat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His breathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering his rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers. 
Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge of tears. 
He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his direction. 
Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat falling into his eyes. 
MAURICE (whisper) It's over Ellen... I failed you again. 
Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing larger. 
MAURICE I tried Ellen, I really tried... I don't have the strength. 
The cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks. Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS. 
MAURICE You said I would never be alone!... You promised... (his yelling turns to sobs) ... You promised. 
Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears... 
There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle shade on Maurice's face. 
Maurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows in his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered eagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is breathtaking. 
CUT TO: 
ROAD 
The car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in seconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on the side of the road. 
Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  The driver gets out and calls over the hood. 
DRIVER Hey, man are you okay?

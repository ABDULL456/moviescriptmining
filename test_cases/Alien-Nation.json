{"test1_input": "DETECTIVE I don't know about the rest of you, but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit still for this.  I'm calling the union, pronto. \nOthers grumble.  \"Yeah!\".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk sees this. \nFEDORCHUK Where the hell is he going? \nINT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY \nSykes KNOCKS and enters. \nWARNER Yeah, Sykes? \nSYKES Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective. \nWarner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes. \nWARNER ... All right.  Detective Sergeant Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson. \nJETSON We have met. \nWarner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes, starting to smell something fishy. \nThe balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands. \nGOLDRUP Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office. Congratulations, gentlemen. \nWarner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to. \nWARNER (to Sykes) You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk. \nSYKES (nodding) Departmental policy. \nWARNER (to Jetson) You? \nJETSON Yes, sir. \nWARNER Good. \nSYKES There's another case I'd like to take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer named Hubley. \nJetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something. Sykes avoids his look. \nWARNER Granger and Pitts are already on it. \nSYKES Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... \nWARNER Don't tell me what to think. \nGOLDRUP He's got a point.  That's the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program... \nLong-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nThe steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during: \nSYKES ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. \nJETSON (after a moment) Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. \nSYKES What's that? (then realizing) Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to. \nJETSON I am George. \nSykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up cold. \nSYKES Wait a minute.  George?  George Jetson? \nJetson nods... he's used to this. Sykes cracks up. \n", "test1_true": "JETSON My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'. \nSYKES Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you? \nEXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY \nThey approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile. \nSYKES Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care? \nJETSON That is exactly so. (completely deadpan) It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like \"ss'ai k'ss\", two words in my language which mean \"excrement\" and \"cranium\". \nSykes looks at him, perplexed. \nJETSON \"Shit... head\". \nJetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing there, the smirk dropping from his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY \nThey're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives. Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat. \nSYKES Let's talk Hubley. \nJETSON (refers to a folder he holds) His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown. \nSYKES With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest. \nJETSON (gently correcting him) Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts. \nSYKES (out the window) Nice signal, dickwad! \nJetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes. Then... \nJETSON He was employed at the Northwest Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He was manager of the Methane Facility. He was also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low- cost housing for Newcomers. \nSykes grimaces at the mention of \"Newcomer housing\". \nSYKES Terrific.  A real pillar of the community. (beat) Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off? \nJETSON (checks file) There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings. \nSYKES The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George... \nJETSON The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said-- \nSykes looks over at Jetson, pissed. \nSYKES Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along? \nJETSON Yes. \nSYKES Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand? (Jetson nods) Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him. \nJetson considers this several moments, then-- \nJETSON And as my partner, I ask you to respect me and my desire not to break with procedure. \nSykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy traffic, puts it in \"Park.\" Jetson, who is already a little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it. HORNS instantly go crazy behind them. \nJETSON What is wrong? \nSYKES (very calm) Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right? \nYELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly unsettled by the chaos. \nJETSON Well... yes, quite possibly. \n", "test1_id": 252, "test2_input": "Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO-- \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN \nThe first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes remains passed out on the sofa where we left him. \nEXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN \nThe slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this street at the corner. \nThe tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug- mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint. \nQuint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then slides behind the wheel. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN \nQuint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down, starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy. \nUnder the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works. Mistake. \nJetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his face.  That was the last thing he needed. \nEXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN \nMeanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car. He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck. \nIt is sliding around the corner out of sight just as Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand. Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien phrase, clearly the equivalent of \"Fuck it...\". \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY \nSykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains consciousness reluctantly. \nSYKES This better be good news or money. \nHe shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief with one hand and gives it to Sykes. \nJETSON Hold this. (lurching to the sink) I feel very terrible. \nSykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson, who is running his head under the tap. \nSYKES Where'd you get this?!! \nJETSON A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him. (then, registering that it's day; panicked) I must call my wife... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nJetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach Sykes' desk. \nJETSON She's going to divorce me. \nSYKES George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember? \nJETSON She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it. \nANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY \ndistributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes. \nSECRETARY You guys are looking for somebody named Strader, right? \nSYKES Yeah. \nSECRETARY Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned in.  They found him. (Sykes and Jetson react) Or at least what's left of him, washed up on the beach at Zuma. \nSykes and Jetson react again. \nSECRETARY (continuing; handing over  the message slip) They're still there if you wanna catch them. \n", "test2_true": "SYKES Well, let's roll, George. \nJETSON (with a stricken expression) To the... to the beach? \nSYKES Come on, let's go, dude.

The following is V.O. as the car approaches the water. \nJETSON (V.O.) Stop the car. \nSYKES (V.O.) Why? \nJETSON (V.O.) Please, I must get out here. \nSYKES (V.O.) Come on, you won't have to get near the water. \nJETSON (V.O.) Stop the car! \nWe see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK \nSYKES All right, okay.  Keep your pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt, freak out, for chrissake. \nSykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen of sweat, his hands shaking.  Sykes softens. \nSYKES (continuing) It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. \nJETSON Thank you. \nHe climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan. \nEXT.  BEACH - DUSK \nA quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk suit.  Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and other high tide detritus. \nANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ \nlooking down at the body.  A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing a closer inspection. \nFEDORCHUK Found his wallet in his jacket pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as life. \nCORONER'S TECH Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a bear to make a positive determination, but it looks to me like he was shot before being tossed in the drink.  At least twice-- (indicates where hearts  would've been on the body) -- here, and here. \nSykes absorbs this.  He rises along with Fedorchuk and Alterez. \nSYKES How're you two doing on Tuggle's killer? \nALTEREZ The store owner's son is in a street gang, so now we're thinking maybe it's gang related. \nSYKES Yeah, that's real good.  You guys follow up on that for a coupla months. \nFedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above. \nFEDORCHUK Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand. (calls up to Jetson, even though he's too far away to hear) You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron! \nSYKES I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do. \nAlterez shoots a polaroid of the body.  Sykes grabs it as it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car. Fedorchuk flips him the bird.  As Sykes rounds the car, he sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid chalk marker a big star with \"E.T. P.D.\" printed inside it.  Sykes looks around.  Fedorchuk and the others stand together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his direction. \nSYKES Cute. \nEXT.  BEACH ROAD - DUSK \nSykes has stopped to pick Jetson up. \n", "test2_id": 253, "test3_input": "He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing. \nJETSON Everyone up against that wall. Very slowly. (to Harcourt) Except you. \nHarcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall. Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen. \nJetson takes the \"sample\" dispenser from the table, tosses it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it. All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others. \nHARCOURT One small matter seems to have escaped your attention.  That-- (indicates suitcase) -- is not on any books as a controlled substance.  Legally it might as well be fifty kilos of... grape jelly. \nJETSON The charge is murder... and conspiracy to commit murder. Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably others. \nThere's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue eyes. \nCassandra stares at Harcourt. \nCASSANDRA You... you killed Strader? \nCassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket. \nCASSANDRA Where's Todd?!  Did you do something to Todd?! \nHarcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved. \nHARCOURT Todd?  Who is Todd. (then remembers; smiles) Ah, poor Mr. Watson. \nCassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357 and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's face. \nJETSON NOOO! \nJetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart. Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch... and nothing happens. \nKIPLING I got it! \nKipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously hits her again. \nMeanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm -- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into the wall face-first, pinning him there. \nHARCOURT Kill them both. \nKIPLING Here? \nHARCOURT (raging) Do it! \nQuint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger. There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks up. \nQuint is blown backward away from her. \nSykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the Casull smoking in his hand. \nQuint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He crashes through it. \nANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR \nas the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds. \nANGLE - IN THE OFFICE \nKipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at Sykes. \nSykes dodges into the private office for cover. \nThe three Dealers dive behind any available furniture. \nHarcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office. \nSykes swings around the edge of the private office door, straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires. Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door, covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down. \nAn unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and Kipling escaping, and takes off after them. \nSykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in surrender, rise from behind the furniture. \n", "test3_true": "Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra. \nSYKES You okay? \nCASSANDRA (dazed, but all right) Yeah... \nAnd he charges out the adjoining office door. \nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT \nHarcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is HEARD arriving O.S. \nEXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT \nTwo UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running. \nTwo seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the fire escape, find themselves near the unit. \nHARCOURT Here! \nHe throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear and floors it. \nJetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going. \nJETSON This way! \nHe indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls out. \nA second arriving police unit pulls into the alley, heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get past. \nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nHarcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic. The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them. \nINSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE \nHarcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches... eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and SIREN blast on. \nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nIt looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing the howling police car through traffic. \nJetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy. \nJETSON Slow traffic on your right... you're clear at the left rear... (Sykes changes lanes) Careful, red light ahead... \nWith Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the cross-traffic without incident. \nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nThe traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges around the stopped traffic easily. \nThe same traffic that has pulled over for the police car now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the slug-mobile. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT \nSykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley. \nJETSON Yellow light ahead turning red... \nBut Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it. \nJETSON (continuing; wide- eyed) Red light!  Red light! \nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nSykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side of the road, head-on into traffic. \nHeadlights peel off in front of them as they charge along the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between them. \n", "test3_id": 254}

{"train": "Alien Nation - by Rochne O'Bannon Rewrite by James Cameron \nALIEN NATION \nOriginal Screenplay \nby \nRockne S. O'Bannon \nRewrite \nby \nJames Cameron \nOctober 1987 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE) \nA LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away. The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert- scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct. \nThe VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon.  Waiting. \nThe VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object. \nThe VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local TV van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else. \nAbruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS. \nCRAIS That was the scene in California's Mojave Desert three years ago today -- the historic first view of the Newcomer ship upon its dramatic arrival.  As with the assassination of John Kennedy, who among us does not remember exactly where he was that October nineteenth morning, when news first broke: that people have landed... from another star. \nWe PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal... \nINT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nThe Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar. \nThe off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores. \nFEDORCHUK I remember where I was -- pissing off my balcony at the neighbor's dog! \nOthers laugh. \nALTEREZ (yells at Crais on TV) Get to the goddamn ball scores! \nON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH PROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the bottom of the screen. \nCAL-TECH PROFESSOR From the time mankind first gazed up at the stars there had been speculation about a visit by people from \"out there.\"  How ironic that when that first contact was made, the two hundred and sixty thousand occupants aboard the craft were as surprised as we were about their arrival.  That they awakened from frozen hibernation to find their malfunctioning autopilot had landed them here by mistake. \nThe CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again. \nCRAIS These \"Newcomers,\" we soon learned, were a genetically-engineered race, adapted for hard labor in almost any environmental condition.  In effect, their ship was a slave ship... washed ashore on Earth with no way to get back to where they came from... \nA dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the countertop. \nNow an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN. \nFRESNO HOUSEWIFE When the Newcomers were first let out of the ship, they were quarantined in a camp not ten miles from the town here.  You can imagine how the people around here felt about that.  But once they were releases from the camp and we got a chance to know them, we saw what nice, quiet people they really are... \nWIDER \nrevealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white busboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two trays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern. Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy. \nFEDORCHUK Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight? Workin' hard? \nThe Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but disturbingly alien. \nFEDORCHUK You got your green card, buddy?  You didn't leave home without it? \nTUGGLE Whatever gave you that idea? \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nSykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb among other parked cars. \nINT.  SEDAN - NIGHT \nSykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches for the radio in the glovebox. \nTUGGLE This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a possible two-eleven in progress at Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court and Alvarado.  Requesting backup. \nImpulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing out. \nSYKES Let's do it, partner. \nTuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio Dispatcher confirms the call. \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nThe two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked cars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the counter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door. \nSykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside. \nSYKES You got your vest? \nTUGGLE Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car. \nSYKES Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too. \nThrough the store window the robbery continues in pantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun, yelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register. The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired. \nSykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance. \nTUGGLE Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door. \nSYKES I got him.  Don't get pinned. \nTuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater- corner across the intersection. \nThrough the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves, slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and FIRES another round into the Proprietor. \nSYKES (under his breath) Aw, shit. \nTuggle is almost across the street when he hears the shots. \nThe human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots Tuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine pistol on the seat next to him. \nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT \nKipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire -- BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS. \nA civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the intersection, steam rising from the radiator. \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nTuggle dives behind a lamp post. \nThe Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine pistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire at the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes. Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is sprayed with bullets. \nA forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver. \nTuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien. \nSYKES Get outta there! \nTUGGLE I can't!  Do you mind! \nSYKES I'll cover you!  Get outta there!! \nSykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway car, firing toward the store as he goes. \nThe alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel. \nON SYKES \ndazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused. \nSYKES' P.O.V. \nAn OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him. \nANGLE \nSykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien face.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance, sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again. \nHUMAN COP Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy. (to alien on the ground) You okay? \nSykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet away.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON. \nJETSON I am all right. \nHe gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose. \nHUMAN COP I better call in. \nHe moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat alien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might retaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him to kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on the underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing. Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He struggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help him up. \nJETSON Your hand will require attention. \nSykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip. \nSYKES Get the hell away from me!  I don't need your goddamn help. \nHe almost loses his balance and has to steady himself against the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture of impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him, with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit when trying to understand human nature. \nEXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT \nOPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the Coroner's wagon. \nWIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some alien).  He moves into: \nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT \nThe CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs out of the wall, photographing everything.  Several UNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around the room like a stranger at a party. \nThe Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from her lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get her away from the body, but can't get her to budge. \nMINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the Raincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking veteran uniform cop is with him. \nNATUZZI Looks like a standard combat pump- action. \nMINKLER It is. \nNATUZZI So what punched holes clear through that car out there? \nMinkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box. Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells. \nMINKLER BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty-caliber slug going two thousand feet per second.  Tug might as well've been hiding behind a rosebush. \nMinkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him. He looks.  It's Sykes. \nNATUZZI Pretty heavy artillery for knocking over a liquor store. \nA new voice enters the conversation. \nJETSON (O.S.) An identical round was used in the shooting of a Newcomer named Hubley, two days ago. \nSykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to see the voice is Jetson's. \nMINKLER Yeah?  So why the extra fire power? \nJETSON Perhaps because even the larger caliber handguns aren't always effective against my people. \nDETECTIVE I don't know about the rest of you, but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit still for this.  I'm calling the union, pronto. \nOthers grumble.  \"Yeah!\".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk sees this. \nFEDORCHUK Where the hell is he going? \nINT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY \nSykes KNOCKS and enters. \nWARNER Yeah, Sykes? \nSYKES Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective. \nWarner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes. \nWARNER ... All right.  Detective Sergeant Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson. \nJETSON We have met. \nWarner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes, starting to smell something fishy. \nThe balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands. \nGOLDRUP Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office. Congratulations, gentlemen. \nWarner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to. \nWARNER (to Sykes) You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk. \nSYKES (nodding) Departmental policy. \nWARNER (to Jetson) You? \nJETSON Yes, sir. \nWARNER Good. \nSYKES There's another case I'd like to take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer named Hubley. \nJetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something. Sykes avoids his look. \nWARNER Granger and Pitts are already on it. \nSYKES Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... \nWARNER Don't tell me what to think. \nGOLDRUP He's got a point.  That's the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program... \nLong-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nThe steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during: \nSYKES ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. \nJETSON (after a moment) Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. \nSYKES What's that? (then realizing) Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to. \nJETSON I am George. \nSykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up cold. \nSYKES Wait a minute.  George?  George Jetson? \nJetson nods... he's used to this. Sykes cracks up. \nSYKES Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you? \nJETSON Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I-- \nSYKES Great. (a relieved sigh) Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you? \nAnd with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly out. \nSYKES I think we're really starting to click now, George -- hmmm? \nJetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY \nWINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading Sykes and Jetson along the hall.  He reads on the fly from a case file in his hand. \nWINTER You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning... \nSYKES Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours. \nINT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY \nThey enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move among the tables (some occupied, some not) during: \nWINTER Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car-- \nSYKES The human? \nWINTER Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock. \nThey have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the pale naked body of the Raincoat alien. \nJETSON Have you identified this one? \nWINTER So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam Slag, if you like. \nJetson smiles slightly out of politeness. \nWINTER No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match. \nSYKES Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets. \nJetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter and Sykes continue talking off to one side. \nWINTER (referring to Raincoat alien) You took this gut out, too, didn't you? \nSYKES Yeah. \nWINTER Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts. \nSYKES Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him. \nWINTER That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off. \nDuring this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over -- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully. Then he peels back the alien's upper lip. \nJetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER. Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain oblivious. \nWINTER Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one. (hands Sykes a polariod of dead alien's face) We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff. \nSYKES Yeah, I'll bet. \nSykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in earnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the alien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what Jetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something Jetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson. \nSYKES What's this?  What's going on? \nJETSON Nothing. \nSYKES (really suspicious now) Nothing? \nHarcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up. \nHARCOURT Mr. Mayor... \nMAYOR William, I was wondering if you wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and me.  Two limousines trying to make it across town in all this traffic, we're bound to be later than we already are. \nHARCOURT Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if you know two of your police officers... Detective Jetson and Sykes. \nMAYOR (shaking their hands, dismissively) A pleasure. (to Harcourt) We really should be going. \nThe wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of the Mayor with a very impatient expression.  Harcourt smiles. \nHARCOURT (continuing) Please feel free to call my office Monday morning for an appointment. (to Jetson) Congratulations again on your promotion, Detective.  Remember... you're out there setting an example in our community.  I'll be keeping an eye on you. \nHarcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning. Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT \nWalking behind the others.  They speak in very low voices; Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs during: \nKIPLING That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver. \nHARCOURT This is becoming a serious breach of security. \nKIPLING He didn't recognize me. \nHARCOURT It is his new partner that I'm worried about. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT \nMAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets. Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing line. \nSYKES Go on ahead.  I'll be right in. (to Maffet, low) What'd you dig up for me? \nMaffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore.  By his manner this deal is definitely not kosher.  Sykes hefts the weapon. \nMAFFET You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it. \nSYKES What is it? \nMAFFET Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads. \nSYKES (flips open cylinder) Only holds five. \nMAFFET Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one. \nSYKES (sighting) No... two. \nEXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT \nJetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.  Jetson slips the protectors down. \nSYKES Well, let's see what you got, Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire. \nJetson, a little nervous at this command performance, turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.  It's a large, sloppy grouping. \nSYKES (continuing) How long you been shooting?  That's pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if somebody draws down on you, wave your scores on the written exam at 'em? \nSykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the Casull. \nJETSON Why did you do it? \nSYKES Why'd I do what? \nJETSON Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner... \nSYKES My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing... \nSYKES (over his shoulder to Jetson) Back off, George. \nJETSON But I-- (know this man). \nSYKES I'll handle it. \nJetson backs off, letting him handle it. \nSYKES (to Porter) Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again-- (slowly) Is your name Porter? \nPORTER Ss'kya'ta'. \nSYKES (to Jetson) What's that? \nJETSON Screw you. \nSYKES (back to Porter) Screw me?  That can't be right. \nPORTER Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya' ss'lato na'! \nJETSON (to Sykes, low) You don't want to know. \nSYKES Tell me. \nJETSON Your mother mates out of season. \nSYKES (to Porter) That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know? \nAnd instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around him.  Jetson gets a blast of it, too.  The aliens are momentarily blinded. \nSykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his face, as he starts to handcuff him.  But Porter gets a hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight. Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of satisfaction. \nPorter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table.  The crowd HOOTS and CHEERS.  Sykes finds his way to his feet. \nJETSON Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this). \nSYKES Stay back!  I'm okay. \nHe charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club. The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin. Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises again -- smiling. \nPORTER Don't they teach you anything about us in cop school, little ss'loka'? \nPorter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking with Porter's, blocking the punch.  It is Jetson. \nJETSON Enough. \nPORTER (eyeing Jetson) Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a cop. (with some contempt) It fits you. \nJetson says something to him in the alien language. Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back exit.  Sykes stumbles over to Jetson. \nSYKES You know that guy? \nJETSON (nods) From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together. \nSYKES How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him? \nJETSON In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families... \nAnd he moves toward the back exit.  Sykes watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  \"X\" BAR - NIGHT \nPorter leans against an alley wall.  He speaks English learned on the streets. \nJETSON You don't know what your father and these two men were arguing about? \nPORTER I told you -- I was in the back of the store.  I just heard voices, muffled like. \nSYKES One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him? \nSYKES And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one. \nJETSON Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'. \nSYKES Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow. \nJetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably well. \nINT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT \nAn upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The antithesis of the \"X\" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nrevealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a mane as she undulates to the MUSIC. \nSykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson quickly intercept her as she heads backstage. \nJETSON You are Cassandra? \nCASSANDRA That's right. \nJETSON We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am-- \nCASSANDRA (laughing) Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect. \nSYKES We're looking for your boss -- Strader. \nShe eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage, assuming they will follow. \nINT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nShe moves along the narrow corridor. \nCASSANDRA He's not here.  Why ask me? \nJETSON The young woman at the front said you might know where he is. \nCASSANDRA She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change. \nSYKES No problem. \nShe moves through a door.  Sykes follows closely so does Jetson. \nINT.  ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nCassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall. \nSYKES Look, we're not here doing an interview for the school paper. This is a homicide investigation... and if you don't stop jerkin' us around, I'm ready to start playin' hardball. \nJetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room. Sykes rapidly motions to him to \"go look around\".  Jetson mimes back, \"Huh?\" \nCASSANDRA (slipping out of her dance costume) Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes. \nSYKES (still miming to Jetson) Does that cost extra or you throw them in? \nCASSANDRA You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable... \nFinally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar: \nJETSON I am going out to the car.  I will meet you there. \nSykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor. Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish, low-cut dress. \nCASSANDRA Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes. \nSYKES (starting to feel a little uncomfortable) The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows. \nCASSANDRA (tensing slightly) Todd?  Todd doesn't know either. \nShe is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of his jacket. \nQuint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy. \nQUINT You never seen this before, have you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't gonna believe it... seawater is like battery acid to these guys... I don't know what it is, some kinds chemical reaction.  Whatta you think it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him. (a wave breaks outside, the foam rolls in) What I love about the surf is you can never tell how far up it's going to come until it... whoops, got a little wet there. \nThe wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He screams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the surface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand. We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the hand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging. \nQUINT Last call, sucker.  One... two... THREE! \nWatson is flung into the surf. \nANGLE \nHarcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the waterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then nothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water. Harcourt seems unperturbed. \nKIPLING When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley. \nHARCOURT This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately. \nA wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back. Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops six inches from his dress shoes. \nHARCOURT (continuing) We must learn to embrace the things we fear... and from that grow strong. \nA moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo. He motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab the body and heave it into the waves. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the kitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a glass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out of the refrigerator two nights ago. \nHe sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement. He finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes take a long pull on the vodka. \nJETSON (holds up milk carton) Would you mind? \nSykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi- lumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces. Then-- \nSYKES (indicates phone) So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she? \nJETSON My wife?  She worries about me. \nSykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his voice more weary then bitter. \nSYKES Yeah... I know the routine. \nJETSON You are married? \nSYKES Was.  Divorced. \nJETSON We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us. \nSYKES It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place. \nJetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand this.  They drink... Jetson gazes around. \nJETSON Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in. \nSYKES (growling) I appreciate your honesty, George. \nHe smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink. \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER \nSykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared photo. \nSYKES Ignore the bitch on the left, that's Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda an old picture... she's twenty now. Getting married, in fact... on Sunday. \nJetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the proffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now. \nJETSON Human children can be very beautiful. (then) Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then... \nSYKES (uneasy) Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go. (mumbles) She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there... \nSykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO-- \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN \nThe first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes remains passed out on the sofa where we left him. \nEXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN \nThe slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this street at the corner. \nThe tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug- mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint. \nQuint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then slides behind the wheel. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN \nQuint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down, starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy. \nUnder the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works. Mistake. \nJetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his face.  That was the last thing he needed. \nEXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN \nMeanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car. He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck. \nIt is sliding around the corner out of sight just as Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand. Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien phrase, clearly the equivalent of \"Fuck it...\". \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY \nSykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains consciousness reluctantly. \nSYKES This better be good news or money. \nHe shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief with one hand and gives it to Sykes. \nJETSON Hold this. (lurching to the sink) I feel very terrible. \nSykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson, who is running his head under the tap. \nSYKES Where'd you get this?!! \nJETSON A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him. (then, registering that it's day; panicked) I must call my wife... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nJetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach Sykes' desk. \nJETSON She's going to divorce me. \nSYKES George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember? \nJETSON She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it. \nANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY \ndistributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes. \nSECRETARY You guys are looking for somebody named Strader, right? \nSYKES Yeah. \nSECRETARY Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned in.  They found him. (Sykes and Jetson react) Or at least what's left of him, washed up on the beach at Zuma. \nSykes and Jetson react again. \nSECRETARY (continuing; handing over  the message slip) They're still there if you wanna catch them. \nHe's wiping the \"E.T. P.D.\"  from the door as Jetson approaches from the edge of the bluff.  Fedorchuk pulls up alongside in his n.d. sedan.  He calls off to Jetson, who is still twenty yards away. \nFEDORCHUK Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy? \nSYKES Lay off, asshole. \nFEDORCHUK I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing. \nSykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans against it. \nSYKES Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god detective...? \nSykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with). \nHe shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing Fedorchuk's car keys with the other. \nSYKES (continuing) Then detect these! \nFedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.  Jetson, just climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this scene without knowing how it began. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK \nSykes gets in, slams the door.  His hand hurts as he grabs the wheel.  He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H. Jetson looks over, curious. \nJETSON What was that about? \nSYKES (embarrassed that he defended Jetson) Nothing. \nOn Jetson's confused expression, we-- \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT \nA different burger stand.  Sykes and Jetson sit across from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.  This time they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they talk. \nSYKES ... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style. \nJETSON Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub... \nSYKES ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. (beat) So what the hell's the connection? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT \nSykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office.  Winter is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk. \nSYKES You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet? \nWINTER (his mouth full) You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now. \nJETSON Is Bentner here?  I must speak with him. \nWINTER He went home early -- his kid was sick. \nJetson frowns. \nWINTER (continuing) Yeah, but he left something for you. \nHe wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson.  Jetson tears open the sealed envelope.  The message inside is written in the alien language. \nWINTER (continuing) Does this have something to do with the test he ran that he wouldn't tell me about? \nCLOSE ON - JETSON \nHis expression grows stricken as he reads the message. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSYKES (getting very curious and suspicious now) What kind of test? \nSYKES George?  How about you drive... \nJetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote of confidence.  They walk quickly around to the opposite doors, climb in. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT \nSykes and Jetson move down this government-building corridor. \nSYKES There's gotta be some other connection. \nThey enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS. \nINT.  BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT \nHIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling this huge room.  It's all but deserted.  Sykes and Jetson are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after hours. \nCLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK \nShe sits at her computer terminal.  Sykes and Jetson stand behind her as she types in commands and information. \nShe types: Hubley, Warren.  The computer screen flashes past various information, then settles on a screen full of information of HUBLEY, WARREN. \nOPERATOR Here's Hubley. (scanning it) Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery. \nSYKES Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'? \nOPERATOR For you, anything. \nThe Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA.  The screen fills with information. \nOPERATOR (continuing, reading from screen) Released on November twenty-ninth. Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks after arriving he took over the abandoned club which is now Encounters. \nJETSON (to Operator) Now the store owner, please.  Cecil Porter. \nShe types it in. \nOPERATOR Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son. \nSYKES Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here. \nOPERATOR I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up... \nBut Sykes wasn't listening.  He's starting off... an idea forming.  He stands there a moment, considering it, his face looking like he's chewing something sour.  It's so off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it. Then-- \nSYKES Holy shit... (to Jetson) Look what we're staring at: three Newcomers with nothing in common, right?  What if it's just one other guy who killed these three? (Jetson looks at him blankly) Three and one make four.  Four Newcomers... of totally different backgrounds... (Jetson still doesn't get it) You and the store owner's son -- that punker! \nSuddenly the realization hits Jetson, too.  He looks at Sykes. \nJETSON ... Quarantine. \nSykes spins to the Operator, excited. \nSYKES Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing? \nOPERATOR Sure.  Just a minute. \nShe moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information. \nOPERATOR (to herself) Porter was in Lodge seven seven two. \nShe rapidly types in additional information.  The screen shifts as she jumps files.  Finally she gets a line that reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2. \nSykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then information flashes past as the computer searches... then, finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY, WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA......... \nSykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true. \nOn the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL......... \nSykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth name. \nOn the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM. \nHe says it with such straightforward eye contact, that Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing. \nJETSON Everyone up against that wall. Very slowly. (to Harcourt) Except you. \nHarcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall. Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen. \nJetson takes the \"sample\" dispenser from the table, tosses it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it. All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others. \nHARCOURT One small matter seems to have escaped your attention.  That-- (indicates suitcase) -- is not on any books as a controlled substance.  Legally it might as well be fifty kilos of... grape jelly. \nJETSON The charge is murder... and conspiracy to commit murder. Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably others. \nThere's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue eyes. \nCassandra stares at Harcourt. \nCASSANDRA You... you killed Strader? \nCassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket. \nCASSANDRA Where's Todd?!  Did you do something to Todd?! \nHarcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved. \nHARCOURT Todd?  Who is Todd. (then remembers; smiles) Ah, poor Mr. Watson. \nCassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357 and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's face. \nJETSON NOOO! \nJetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart. Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch... and nothing happens. \nKIPLING I got it! \nKipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously hits her again. \nMeanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm -- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into the wall face-first, pinning him there. \nHARCOURT Kill them both. \nKIPLING Here? \nHARCOURT (raging) Do it! \nQuint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger. There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks up. \nQuint is blown backward away from her. \nSykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the Casull smoking in his hand. \nQuint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He crashes through it. \nANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR \nas the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds. \nANGLE - IN THE OFFICE \nKipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at Sykes. \nSykes dodges into the private office for cover. \nThe three Dealers dive behind any available furniture. \nHarcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office. \nSykes swings around the edge of the private office door, straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires. Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door, covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down. \nAn unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and Kipling escaping, and takes off after them. \nSykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in surrender, rise from behind the furniture. \nSykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull with the other.  He brings it up and around right in front of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window at Kipling. \nAt that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser. \nJetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to something else he sees beyond it. \nJETSON Green light, Matthew. (Sykes doesn't respond) Green light! \nNow Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting start coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for the slug-mobile. \nSYKES Shit! \nJETSON Ss-ai! \nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nSykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple of cars and speeds away. \nBecause of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of action.  He skids a left onto a side street. \nEXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nSykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a right onto another street that parallels the street the police unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts back in behind the police unit. \nEXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT \nSykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the police unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it. \nINT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT \nHarcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug- mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper. \nEXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT \nWith the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right, cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto-- \nEXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT \nThe police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street tunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a pile-up of traffic behind the police unit. \nThe slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of traffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells-- \nSYKES Move your goddamned cars! \nPeople climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered -- ignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car far enough forward to get around.  He speeds off. \nINT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT \nKipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile behind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of traffic. \nEXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT \nSykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at Indianapolis. \nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT \nJetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead. \nJETSON There! \nSykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another car as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right, directly for the police unit. \nKipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile broadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit up the off-ramp. \nEXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nDoor handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the right.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes stays right on its ass.  They charge up onto-- \nEXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80 MPH. \nSykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it. \nHIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA \nSykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it, and hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and cold in his hand. \nANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES \nHe approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register that the driver's door of the police unit is now open before-- \n-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes is thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground, and the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of Kipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who killed Bill Tuggle! \nKipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half- second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN ROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes looks. \nANGLE \nJetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull. \nKipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the suitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires again, and again, and again. \nKipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase still over his head... until he is blasted at last and forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the inferno. \nSykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground. Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the alien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed in the orange flickering glow of the fire. \nHIGH WIDE SHOT \nof the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two cops... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT \nThe police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's wagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing. \nJETSON With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now. \nSYKES (cool) It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book. (smiles) ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective. \nJetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red and blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them. Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop. \nWILTEY I'll give you guys a lift to the station.  They're waiting to take your statements on the shootings. \nSYKES (to Jetson) Let's go, partner. (then casually correcting Wiltey as he rises) And it's shooting.  Singular. \nWILTEY They said two. \nSYKES Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he o.d.'d. \nSHOCK CUT - JETSON \nWe rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward Sykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned to ice. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT \nANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front. \nDRIVER So it's just me and her left in the hot tub, right? \nATTENDANT You and the blonde? \nDRIVER No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's gone in the house with some other guy.  But a few minutes later she comes back out, alone, when me and the redhead are going at it fast and furious in the tub, ya know... and she sees us, and... she climbs right in with us... \nATTENDANT You're full of shit! \nDRIVER I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'... \nAnd, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nSYKES Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up? \nJETSON (a difficult admission) Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming. \nSYKES But there's no more drug. \nJETSON You understand that.  But how many others will? \nSykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression. \nJust then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was, was large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse door. \nWILTEY There he is! \nAnd Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to stop him. \nJETSON Wiltey! \nHe and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left, rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight. Sykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF BRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through. \nINT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nLOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear around the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling fumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the car.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the car.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE UP farther, and-- \n-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting on the hood of the patrol car. \nSykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body lies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have done this so fast? \nTHEIR POV \nThere are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell. The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and DRIPS of this waterfront building. \nANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON \nJetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun from the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes checks the Casull. \nThey exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they split up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the right. \nWITH JETSON \nAs he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled debris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to HOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases open slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all the way.  There's nothing inside... now. \nJetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the warehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view. \nINT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT \nSykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER. He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table and a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to some local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite out of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched on the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight. \nSykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight. He looks around, then continues on. \nINT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT \nJetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a set of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the stairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs. \nINT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT \nSykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging from the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins pushing through them. \nSYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS \nBecause of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack of nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through -- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the way he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is-- \n-- a terrifying face! \nON SYKES \nHe stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is. It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship. The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous visage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start his heart again. \nINT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT \nJetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a door.  He eases it open, enters. \nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nSykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the cabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the open sea. \nEXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT \nJetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from above.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low, the sun-gun washing over the docks. \nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nThe sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The Pilot starts to take it down. \nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nSykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net toward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on his leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls away.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain. \nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nJetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the dock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open door.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto the dock. \nJETSON On that boat -- out there! \nJetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth of the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes. \nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nSykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging over the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the bow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey trapped. \nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nJetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the channel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck, looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt at the stern dinghy. \nEXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nThe Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back at what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in. \nCAPTAIN Hey! \nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nHarcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him. He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back with it and lets it fly like a spear. \nEXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nThe gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest. The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back against the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the engines REV loudly. \nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nHarcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie line on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the ratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides backward into water! \nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nJetson watches this happen. \nEXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT \nThe dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat. \nHarcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is sinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward him.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his might.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the line.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when-- \n-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the dinghy from the fishing boat! \nThe dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is on him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to wash in over the transom. \nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nJetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy below. \nEXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT \nHarcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water touches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt off balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the dinghy. \n", "test1_input": "SYKES Well, one of the men didn't like him so much... \nThey stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of Raincoat alien.  They have stopped near the heavy refrigeration-type door leading to the \"METHANE SECTION\". \nNewcomer workers move in and out through the door during: \nO'NEAL (looking at photo) You think this is the guy who did it? \nSYKES We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him? \nO'NEAL To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me. \nSYKES (impatient) Who else can I ask around here? \nO'NEAL (looking at photo again) Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off. \nSYKES I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off. \nO'Neal reacts.  Sykes notices the door to the Methane Section. \nSYKES That where Anderson worked? \nO'NEAL Yes it is. (some alien workers come through the door) Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it. \nSykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the door.  O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of suspicion. \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL \nWe see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off.  O'Neal watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts up this way. We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second level. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  METHANE SECTION CONTROL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nO'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial. Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE - BELOW \nCAMERA TRACKS through the Methane Section... past the alien workers in lab whites... past all the arcane equipment and chemical procedures... ending in an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid. \nCUT TO: \nINT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK \nWe're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.  Jetson's WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn with a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his bicycle along the walkway.  Jetson, dressed in his suit for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son. \nSykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes. \nSYKES Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and Harriet... \nHe HONKS the horn.  Jetson looks up, then moves to his wife and kisses her goodbye.  Moves to his son, kisses him on the top of his head. \nSykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his derisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may be, there's something very appealing about the innocence of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes. \nJetson starts to climb into the car, and we-- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT \nCLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug dispensers from a tuxedo pocket.  As the hand brings the dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before. It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE.  We PAN with the hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and sunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his tongue.  He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the drug hits him. \nThe door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED POLITICO enters, obviously drunk. \nKipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the Politico to the exit... \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel. \nJETSON Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well. \nSYKES (impatient) Did you learn anything? \nJETSON A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley. \nSYKES Aw-right.  What about the other guy? \nJETSON She didn't know him.  But she said her son might. \nSYKES Did you talk to him? \nJETSON He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him. \nSykes nods. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only two of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's platform, addresses the assembly. \nMAYOR ... Our guest speaker tonight has done so much in his community and for his community in such a short period of time.  And I must say, as the founder of the first Newcomer owned and operated corporation in Southern California, he certainly has come quite far in the last few years.  Granted, not as far as he came in the years before reaching Los Angeles. \nThere is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a seat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and whispers something into the ear of the person seated to his right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is whispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods. \nMAYOR (continuing) As Mayor of this city, it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who has so readily made our city his home... and all of us who live here, his friends.  Ladies and gentlemen, William Harcourt. \nThe VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front table.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right. Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes that glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his right, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes somewhat from the bright spotlight. \nOnce behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast pocket as the applause ebbs. \nHARCOURT Thank you all for that very warm reception. (pauses, smiles) I'm particularly grateful because I actually had the gall to write that in my notes: \"Thank you all for that very warm reception\".  Imagine how embarrassed I would've been if it hadn't have been such a warm reception. \nThe VIPs laugh.  He's won them over instantly with his charm and candor. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT \nSykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and Kipling.  We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight two nights before... but because Kipling looks so different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright.  Still, during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure what. \nSYKES William Harcourt? \nHARCOURT Yes... \nSYKES I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department. \nHARCOURT (nodding greeting) Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet. \nJETSON I am the first. \nHARCOURT Congratulations.  This is my administrative assistant, Rudyard Kipling. \nSYKES (throw away) Rudyard Kipling?  No shit? (to Harcourt) Listen, we just need a minute of your time... \nJETSON We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley. \nHARCOURT Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic. \nSYKES You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing. \nHARCOURT That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function. \nSuddenly there's a voice from O.S.: \nMAYOR (O.S.) William... \n", "test1_id": 252, "test2_input": "The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise. \nSuddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into some furniture and dives for the door. \nINT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWatson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape. Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong as he is, but he has the edge in experience. \nJetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway, ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went. \nSYKES (struggling with Cassandra) Fire escape!  End of the hall! \nJetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and charges down the corridor. \nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT \nJetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees Watson reach the ground and take off running for the parking area. \nJetson reaches the ground and gives chase. \nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nWatson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting down other rows trying to make up the distance between them. \nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT \nSykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen feet to the ground. \nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nWatson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls his gun, aims. \nThe white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there, gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to avoid being hit. \nINT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT \nWatson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas. Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car. Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass, panics and-- \nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT \n-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars. \nSykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car. \nWatson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson folds over with a \"ooowwph\" sound and drops to his knees. \nSYKES (breathing hard) I'll be damned.  It worked. (sees Jetson run up) How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo! Both barrels.  Dropped him like a bag of cement. \nJetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the I.D. \nSYKES Who is he? \nJETSON Todd Watson.  The assistant manager. \nWatson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one agonized breath. \nWATSON I don't believe this.  Look at my suit.  Look at what you made me do to my car. \nSYKES (laughing) Your girlfriend put up a better fight than you did, pal. \nJETSON We are looking for your employer, Joshua Strader. \nWATSON He's out of town. \nJETSON Why did you run? \nWATSON Because you two were chasing me. \nSYKES We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch. \nJETSON When will Strader return? \n", "test2_true": "SYKES (wearily) Watson... this is my partner here's first coupla days, and he wants to make a good impression.  Me, though, the way I feel -- this could be my last day, know what I mean?  And I'm ready to rain on you like a cow pissin' on a flat rock. \nWATSON Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been around for a coupla days.  He didn't tell me where he was going or when he'd be back.  I swear it. \nSYKES (to Jetson) What do you think? \nJETSON I believe he is probably lying. \nSYKES Through his ass. (to Watson) Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes. \nSykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket. They walk away and Watson slumps against his car. \nANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON \nas they walk wearily to the slug-mobile. \nSYKES George, you can handle the women from now on, you mind? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nWatson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he hears footsteps.  He turns with a \"What now?\" expression and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's employ. \nQUINT (to other Thugs) Okay, scrape him up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT \nHarcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs. The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d. van. \nHarcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three human Thugs. \nThey have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron. He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious. \nHARCOURT Any progress? \nQUINT My arm's gettin' tired and so far, zip. \nKIPLING He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to Strader. \nQUINT What's that mean? \nKIPLING Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to Strader is above pain or life. \nQUINT You tellin' me this guy would die before he'd screw his boss and work for us?  Nobody's that dumb. \nKIPLING It is something you couldn't comprehend, Quint. \nHarcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand. \nHARCOURT I understand you have been resisting my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but -- no longer an issue, I'm afraid... \nHarcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes widen in fear. \nHARCOURT (continuing) I will not make this offer again.  I want you to work for me, to manage the nightclub as Strader's successor. If you do, you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine... \nWatson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant. \nWATSON Sss'k'a ta'! \nHarcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring his resolve.  Then-- \nHARCOURT It is such a pity to die for an outmoded value. (rising) Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for our friend's swimming lesson. \nWatson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains. \nHARCOURT (to Watson) It's important to learn new skills. Essential to your growth as a person. \n", "test2_id": 253, "test3_input": "Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the drug.  It glistens blue on his finger.  It holds him mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so. \nSYKES (tentatively stepping closer) Is that it...? \nA beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall. \nSYKES Uh, George... \nJETSON (in O'Neal's face) Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it? \nO'NEAL (choking) What drug?  This is an oil refinery, you... \nJETSON (pushing harder) WHERE?! \nO'NEAL (unable to breathe) You... can't do... this! \nSYKES George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones... \nJETSON Stay out of this, Matthew. (to O'Neal) Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall. \nO'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided to back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the \"good cop\" role. \nSYKES Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up. \nO'NEAL (at length, with great effort) ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon. \nJETSON How much? \nO'NEAL About fifty kilos... of concentrate... and some street grade... in tubes. \nJetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure. O'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush this man. \nJETSON Where have they taken it? \nO'NEAL Encount... Encounters Club. \nFinally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor, gasping for air. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT \nThis time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set and hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically has to run to keep up. \nSYKES George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit. \nJETSON The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street. \nSYKES Why?  What's the big goddamn deal? \nJetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile, yanks it open. \nSYKES (continuing; as Jetson starts the car You destroy that drug, you destroy the case.  Don't blow the whole thing now by not following procedure. \nJETSON (through the open driver's window) Fuck procedure. \nAnd to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels out. \nSYKES Hey!! \nJetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile bashes through the barricade bar. \nSYKES GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!! \nSykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no car.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off his shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it, waving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop. \nSYKES Police.  Get out.  I need this thing.  Out, now! \nThe poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into gear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other traffic.

ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT \nCassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two alien, one human) through the deserted club. \nINT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nShe leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door. \nIt is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth. She struggles until she sees who it is. \nJETSON I am here to take Harcourt.  Where is he? \nShe hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a nod toward the office door. \nCASSANDRA In there. \nJETSON (pulling his gun) Show me. \nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nThe large suitcase rests on the expansive conference table.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens it.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the viscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual dispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room. The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light and dark. \nThe two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the drug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is. \nHARCOURT (to alien dealers) It's been a long time, hasn't it, gentlemen? \nHUMAN DEALER What is it? \nHARCOURT A sweet indulgence from out past... resurrected for our future. \nHarcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the dispensers from the suitcase. \nHARCOURT (continuing; to alien  dealers) Please feel free to sample the quality.  The experience will be everything you remember it to be... \nOne of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to his tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt-- \nALIEN DEALER Where'd you get it? \nHARCOURT I arranged to spend some time with three very resourceful men.  With a certain amount of coaxing, one of them was able to reconstitute the formula for me. (beat) They worked very well together. Unfortunately, they are no longer with us... but I was fortunate enough to reap the benefit of their endeavor. \nHe indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways gently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over him.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the dispenser. \nHUMAN DEALER Let me try some. (he does, immediately spits it out) Jesus!  Tastes like detergent! \nHARCOURT And that's all the effect it will have on you.  But when my fellow Newcomers learn they can obtain it here, they will work very hard... to make as much money as they can... to give it to me. \nSuddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to the other office: \nVOICE You haven't told him all of it. \nHarcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet, caught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder holster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then steps out himself.  It is Jetson. \nQuint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds. \nIt is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring to the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch. \nQUINT He's got the C-4 charge! \nJetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of him.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him. He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he can see her. \nQUINT (continuing) Just take it real casual, buddy. Keep your finger on that button and don't do nothing squirrely. \nHARCOURT If you release that button, you not only kill us, but yourself. \nJETSON To get you and that-- (indicates drug in suitcase) -- I would do it. \n", "test3_id": 254}

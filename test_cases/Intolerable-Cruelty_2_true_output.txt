CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON 
An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an asthmatic. 
His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at someone off. At length, a voice: 
VOICE ...Are you Joe? 
Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes. WHUSH. 
GANGSTER ...Dumbarton? 
A reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a seedy low-lit clam house. Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope adorn the walls.. 
MILES I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy. 
GANGSTER Who's the pigeon? 
MILES Excuse me? 
GANGSTER Who do you want me to kill? 
MILES Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey. 
GANGSTER Is that... one person? 
MILES Here's her picture... 
He is shoving an envelope across the table. 
MILES ...and the address where she's staying. It's the residence of a Mr. Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh, it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though he's not involved. And because of an impending legal action this needs to happen within a certain... time frame. Uh... on an expedited basis. 
The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.

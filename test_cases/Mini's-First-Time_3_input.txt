MINI Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home and tell everyone we're a couple? We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers. 
Martin stops and looks at her, surprised. 
MINI Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward? 
His face turns a little red. 
MINI I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration. 
Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed. 
MARTIN You realize he could blackmail us? If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine. 
MINI Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen. 
Her words don't appear to have calmed him. 
EXT. THE POOL - DAY 
Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini. 
MINI (V.O.) The next few days were a laugh riot. 
Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously. Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth. He instinctively pulls back. 
MINI (V.O.) Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father. 
Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference. 
INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes M channels. Mini looks very annoyed. 
MINI (V.O.) We returned home and things didn't get much better. 
MONTAGE: 
Mini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror: 
-Catholic School girl. 
MINI (V.O.) What little sex we were having    was getting dull. 
-Cheerleader. 
MINI (V.O.) Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed... 
-Naughty Nurse. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) I was bored. I became concerned that in my world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first... 
-French Maid. 
MINI (V.O.) ...at too young an age. 
-Marilyn Monroe in the sequined dress she sang to JFK in. 
MINI (singing breathily) "Happy birthday, Mr. President" 
MINI (V.O.) As for school, well, I was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death. 
THE DOOR BELL RINGS. Mini looks towards the hallway. 
EXT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well. 
MINI (V.O.) Uh oh. 
MINI Yes? 
GARSON Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I don't know if you remember me? 
MINI Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And "yes", I remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm. 
GARSON (ignoring her dig) So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI Nice work, McGruff. 
GARSON Again, I am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible. 
MINI What do you want? 
GARSON I need to ask you a few more questions about your mother's death.    M INI Sure, come on in.

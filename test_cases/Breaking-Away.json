Tall, new, limestone structures resembling office buildings. Students sit on the steps outside the buildings. They are lying around on the grass and walking to and from classes. All of them have books in hand. The wind is blowing. \nCLOSEUP - DAVE He's sitting next to his bike on the grass and looking around at all of them. In his hands he has his Italian Phrase Book: the book being his admission ticket into this world. It's obvious he's feeling a little out of place, but he enjoys looking at the campus world. A campus Police Car drives by and Dave quickly hides his face in the book. Waits for it to pass and when he looks up he is struck by something. \nMED. SHOT - KATHERINE - DAVE'S P.0.V.

He cuts through the pedestrians crossing the street maneuvering brilliantly. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSEUP - A COLLEGE GUY He's just walking. He sees the piece of paper flying around and grabs it casually.

Dave slams on his. They come to a dead stop. \nDAVE Signorina...You... He's handing her the paper but then he pauses and pulls it back just as she's about to take it. He wipes the saliva off the paper on his jersey, and then gives it to her. \nDAVE It is yours...no? She takes the paper and smiles. Then she laughs. \nKATHERINE You mean you've been chasing me with this? Well, that's redly something. Thank you very much. Talk about chivalry. Dave is just looking at her.

QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1 \nA narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation. Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their walk. MII\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is singing. The others are humming along. The melody of the song of \"0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie\" but it's a loose version. \nMIME \nAND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME \nON THE\"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P \nBLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS \nAND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS \nI HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R \nTO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P. \nI HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR \nTO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL. By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a large trophy. \nDAVE Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot \nCYRIL Did you really make all that up? They pass. \nANOTHER ANGLE The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed by them. They have to climb over some. \nMIKE I sent away for this stuff from Wyoming. It'll tell you everything. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe it when you see it. \nCYRIL And we'd work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together, eh?

Walls of stone rise up around the guys. \nCYRIL Are you really going to shave your legs? \nDAVE Certo. All the Italians do it. \nMIKE That's some country.

Man, X that'd be great. Like when they get hit on their head with a frying pan and their head looks like a frying pan-with a handle and everything. And then they go b-r-r-r. (shakes his head) And their head comes back to normal. That'd be great.. \nMIKE How come you're so stupid, Cyril. \nCYRIL I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress. \nDAVE You hear from your folks, Moocher? 567 Cont. \nREVISED - \"BAMBINO\" - 8/12/78 5 1-B Coat. \nMOOCHER .. Yeah, my Dad called.

They could use the money. \nDAVE You can come and live with me when it's sold. In Italy everybody lives together. All three of them are getting concerned about Mike. \nMOOCHER Ever since you won that Italian X bike you've been acting weird.

They see Mike standing on top of the rock above them. \nMIKE It's got no back on it! He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks.

He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive. \nCLOSEUP - OUR GUYS They are stunned. \nCLOSEUP - MIKE He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined. \nCYRIL I've never seen anyone dive off from there. \nMIS \nBASTARDS[ \n(CLIMBING DOWN \nTHE ROCK) They've got indoor pools and outdoor pools on the campus but they got to come here.

Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing hard appears in the FRAME. He tries to appear that he's not tired. He smiles. \nDAVE Buon giorno. Come sta? The Italians look stunned. The 1ST ITALIAN is annoyed. The ZTH ITALIAN seems amused. \nCUT TO: \nFRONT SHOT - THE FLATS 135 The Italians are riding hard. The effort is showing on their faces. Dave is behind them. He too is tired. But when the 1st Italian looks back to see how Dave is doing Dave manages to smile. This seems to \"psyche\" the lst Italian out. He gestures angrily to Dave to take his turn up front. Dave is thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The following conversations will have to be subtitled. \nDAVE Oggi fa caldo, none vero? (It's hot today isn't it?) \n1ST ITALIAN Roba da chiodi] (You don't say]) \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nANGLE ON DAVE \"PULLING\" He's up front breaking wind for the others. He's working hard and he's tired. The Italians behind him are likewise. Dave swings off to let another rider pull in front. As he does Dave once again smiles. He doesn't do this to fool them. He's just thrilled to be in their company. \nDAVE 'Cho tempo Para piovera? (Do you think it'll rain?) \n1ST ITALIAN \nFILAREI \n(SCRAM] ) The nth Italian tries to calm him down.

He's thinking. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nANGLE ON THE HILL 136 The Italians are switching off as they begin another ascent. It's Dave's turn to take the lead. As he goes up front the 1st Italian reaches in and pushes Dave's lever all the way forward. This suddenly shifts Dave into a very high gear. He can hardly turn the cranks. The 1st Italian smiles at him. \n1ST ITALIAN \nMI SCUSII (Excuse me!) He takes off. The other three follow him while Dave fumbles around to get back in the right gear. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nCLOSEUP - THE 1ST ITALIAN He does not look happy. The CAMERA MOVES BACK and we SEE Dave at the front again. \nCLOSEUP - DAVE He's getting a little more serious. He sees a huge pothole in front of him. He rides right toward it and then at the last second he jerks his bike aside. The 1st Italian goes right over the pothole. He's jarred and angry. Dave looks back. Smiles. \nDAVE Mi scusi! The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The lst Italian is getting a brutal look in his face. \nOUT 137 \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nANGLE ON THE FLATS All five of them are continually taking turns being up front. They are approaching a small hill. The lst Italian points to the hill. Dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles. The pace is as hard as it's been. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nANGLE ON THE CREST OF THE HILL 139 Dave is up front. Behind him we see the 2ND ITALIAN taking out his pump. Dave pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The 3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The 4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues. He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry. \n4TH ITALIAN ..Bravo[ Bravo[ Bella robal (Congratulations[ Nice work[) \nCLOSEUP - DAVE His left leg is hurt but more than that his dream seems shattered. \nEXT.

But the crowd, the other riders staring at him, the pressure of the moment is too much for Mike. He just stands there. The lead that they had is evaporating. The other riders are catching up. They are coming around the curve. Moocher runs up to Mike, pushes him away and gets on the bike. His intentions are great, but his legs are short. He can't sit in the saddle and reach the pedals.

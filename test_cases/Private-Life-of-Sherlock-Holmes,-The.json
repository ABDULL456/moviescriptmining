{"test1_input": "WATSON Here! \nHe hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor. Gabrielle is looking around the shop. \nGABRIELLE It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months. \nWatson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object. He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds. \nWhat he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside. \nWATSON Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop? \nHOLMES Maybe. (pointing off) Here comes our letter. \nThrough the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust -- except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back. \nHOLMES Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job -- doing nothing. \nHe reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane. \nGABRIELLE Mr. Holmes -- \nHOLMES Yes? \nGABRIELLE I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames. \nHOLMES It could be worse. You could be at the bottom of the Thames -- much to your discomfort -- and much to my chagrin. \nWATSON I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here. (pointing) No footprints -- just tracks. What does it mean? \nHOLMES I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice. \nThey become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain. \nWATSON (in a frantic whisper) What do we do now? \nHOLMES (unfazed) This way. \nHe leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. They flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open -- concealing them from view. \nRevealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an old BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR (addressing birds) Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I'd forgotten you? \nShe pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Some  of you will be going on a little trip  soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even  an old woman has to live. Although you  might well ask, why? \nShe cackles to herself, glances toward the front door. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Oh.   You never told me we had a letter. \nShe starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. \nThrough a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her. \nThe old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. \nA horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon. As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them. \nFIRST CARTER Morning, Duchess. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Morning. \nSECOND CARTER What have you been doing with yourself? \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR What do you think? Taking dancing lessons. (she stops in front of the cage) How many do you want this time? \nFIRST CARTER Two dozen. \nHe opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR What are they doing with all those canaries? What's going on up there? \nSECOND CARTER Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we don't want to know. \nFIRST CARTER When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions. \nThrough the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it. \nWe MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads: INVERNESS COURIER. \nFIRST CARTER (counting as he transfers canaries) ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four. \n", "test1_true": "SECOND CARTER How about that letter? Does that go, too? \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR No. That's going to be picked up in person. \nShe chuckles. The carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR (to birds) All right, my pretties. Back to sleep you go. See you tomorrow. \nShe pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. There is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off. \nWATSON (a sigh of relief) I really thought we were done for. \nHOLMES (casually) The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time. \nThey step forward, and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street. \nGABRIELLE Did you hear what she said? You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself? \nHOLMES It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it? \nWATSON (shaking his head) Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs... And what was all that about Jonah? And what do you suppose they're doing up there? And where is up there? \nHOLMES My guess would be Scotland.   Inverness, to be more precise. \nWATSON Inverness? \nHOLMES Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage? The Inverness Courier. \nGabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage, and her expression changes. \nGABRIELLE Mr. Holmes! This letter -- (she picks it up) \nHOLMES What about it? \nGABRIELLE (holding it out to him) It's addressed to you. \nHolmes takes the letter, examines the envelope.    It is indeed addressed to him. \nHOLMES Nevertheless -- \nWith the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says: DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London. \nHOLMES (reading) My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and Dr. Watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note. According to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. Your brother, Mycroft. (looking up) What time do you make it, Watson? \nWATSON (consulting watch) \nHOLMES Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft has miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft, I suggest you reset your watch. \nWatson automatcially obeys. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DIOGENES CLUB - DAY \nHolmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascending the steps of a building with an imposing Palladian facade. Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading: DIOGENES CLUB. Members Only. As they reach the top of the steps, Watson stops Holmes. \nWATSON I don't mind telling you I'm a bit apprehensive about this. \nHOLMES I'm rather curious myself as to what is going on in that Machiavellian mind of his. \nWATSON I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame Valladon. \nHOLMES Don't worry.    She's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson. \nHe opens the door and they start in. \nINT. LOBBY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY \nDominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria. Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed PORTER of military bearing, with one arm and a chest full of campaign ribbons. Holmes and Watson stride in. \nHOLMES (to porter) To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes. \nPORTER Right you are. He's expecting you in the upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen will sign in -- (opens leather-bound register, turns it toward them) Surname, Christian name, address, nature of business -- \nHe holds out the pen to them, but they are gone. He looks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up the majestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk. \nPORTER Gentlemen...! \nREADING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY \nA huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and just about as lively. \nA dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The Times.  Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the study.  Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an ash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling ash. As  he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash. \n", "test1_id": 1590, "test2_input": "WATSON Ballet? \nHOLMES There's a lake -- and there's a castle -- and there's a swan that isn't really a swan -- or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster -- \nWATSON Then what is it? \nHOLMES What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid, and has an engine for a heart? \nGABRIELLE An engine? \nHOLMES The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument, and water is an excellent conductor of sound. There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster. \nWATSON Oh? \nHOLMES Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs. Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump. \nGABRIELLE You think my husband was involved in all this? \nHOLMES Yes, Madame Valladon.    I'm sure of it. \nWATSON But why would anybody build a mechanical monster? Just to scare people? \nHOLMES Not very likely. \nGABRIELLE Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband? And why was he buried anonymously? \nHOLMES I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to -- the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments -- better known as the Diogenes Club. \nWATSON The Diogenes Club? \nThere is a knock on the door. \nHOLMES Come in. \nThe door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding a magnum of champagne. \nMANAGER Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for you. \nHOLMES (crossing to him) A bottle of champagne? I didn't order it. \nMANAGER No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These are my instructions. \nHe hands the magnum to Holmes. \nHOLMES Instructions from whom?   Deliver it where? \nMANAGER I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs. \nHOLMES Are you sure you have the right Mr. Ashdown? \nMANAGER (flatly) Quite sure, Mr. Holmes. \nHe turns and exits.   Holmes taps the bottle of champagne thoughtfully. \nHOLMES Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act. \nWATSON I don't like the sound of it. \nGABRIELLE Please be careful. \nAs Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into his sporran. \nWATSON You'd better take this with you. \nHe produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes.    Holmes ignores it, exits. \nEXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - NIGHT \nA gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart. Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle. \nHOLMES Who's minding the castle? \nGUIDE You'd better get on.     It's late. \nHolmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat beside him. \nHOLMES Where are we going?    Some sort of party? \nGUIDE You won't be disappointed in the guest list. \nHOLMES Who's the host? \nGUIDE Jonah. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. MOVING GIG - NIGHT \nAs they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who is grim and uncommunicative. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROAD LEADING TO CASTLE - NIGHT \nThe gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along the lakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart. \nEXT. URQUHART CASTLE - NIGHT \nA workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway. The guide reins up the horse in front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard -- which are now covered with a narrow red carpet. \nThe guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up the steps, examining the red carpet. As he reaches the top, he looks off. \nThe strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by torches planted in the ground. A couple of workmen are are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance of the tower. \nAs Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and Mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat. \nMYCROFT Mr. Ashdown, I presume. \nHOLMES (turning) The red runner, I presume. \n(indicates carpet) You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble just for me. \nMYCROFT It's not for you. (calling into tent) McKeller. (to Holmes) May I have the champagne, please? \nHOLMES (handing him bottle) 1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it? \nMYCROFT Mediocre.   But then again, it's not for drinking. \nA black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroft gives him the champagne. \nMYCROFT Tie it up, will you? \nThe man moves off toward the tower.   Mycroft pulls back the flap of the tent. \nMYCROFT In here. \nHolmes passes inside, Mycroft following. \nINT. TENT - NIGHT \nIt is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge- pole. There are several cots, one of them with the bedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying on a table, among a group of engineering models, are Gabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There are also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and blueprints tacked to them. \nHolmes moves around the tent, taking all this in. \nHOLMES Interesting -- and educational. \nMYCROFT Despite my most emphatic warning, you persisted in meddling. It would have served you right if you'd all drowned. \nHOLMES Sorry to be so unobliging. (stops beside torch) E. Valladon... H'mm. \nMYCROFT (indicating parasol   and stethoscope) I imagine this belongs to    the pretty lady, and this belongs to    your valet... We found them floating in    the lake. \nHOLMES Speaking about things floating in the lake -- \nMYCROFT How much do you know -- or think you know? \nHOLMES I think you're testing some sort of underwater craft -- camouflauged to mislead the gullible. I think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. I think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas... Altogether a strange contraption. \nMYCROFT Not quite that unique. Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible. But none of them could solve the critical problem -- how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective. \nHOLMES What does the Good Book say? \"And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights.\" \nMYCROFT That was our goal. And thanks to Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. It's a highly complex system of filtration -- so we had a series of trials -- \nHOLMES And at least one error. \nMYCROFT During a test run in Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas. Before they could reach the surface, Valladon and the crew were dead. \nHOLMES So you had them buried in unmarked graves, to preserve your secret. \nMYCROFT It was essential to keep the information from your client. \nHOLMES You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from fiding her husband? \nMYCROFT Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's the Imperial German Government. They were after the Belgian engineer -- or rather, his invention. They knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where -- so they enlisted the best brain in England to help them. You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse. \nHOLMES And Madame Valladon -- what part did she play in all this? \nMYCROFT Madame Valladon is dead. \n", "test2_id": 1591, "test3_input": "MYCROFT Yes, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Without any warning? \nMYCROFT That is correct, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA And without showing her colors? \nMYCROFT Indeed, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. (Mycroft stares at her) It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will have none of it! \nMYCROFT I beg your pardon, Ma'am? \nHe exchanges a look with Holmes. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Sometimes we despair of the state of the world. What will scientists think of next? \nMYCROFT That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA A dirigible? And what, pray, is that? \nMYCROFT A rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that. \nMYCROFT We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border. \nQUEEN VICTORIA (indicating sub) Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the better. \nMYCROFT May I point out, Ma'am -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser. (to equerry) Now we wish to return to Balmoral. \nShe starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows, the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmes linger behind. \nHOLMES Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman. (Mycroft is staring at the sub) What a shame. \nAll that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought. \nMYCROFT Not necessarily. If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them? \nHOLMES Give it to them? \nMYCROFT Invite them aboard for the final journey -- seven hundred feet -- straight down. \nHOLMES And how are you going to arrange that? \nMYCROFT I'm rather counting on you to do it. Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal. \nO.s., the bagpiper resumes playing. \nMYCROFT Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty? \nHe starts up the spiral staircase.    Holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN \nThe gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him, comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance. Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his hand, walks into the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nIn the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed. She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders. The other bed has not been slept in. \nThe door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in, carrying the parasol. \nHe crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol. The he moves to the French window, opens it, glances out. \nLAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN \nThe seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore, silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nHolmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a metal lamp-shade overhead. Gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed, clutching her negligee around her. \nHOLMES Sorry about that. But as long as you're up -- what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn't it? \nGABRIELLE (carefully) I think so. \nHOLMES And how would you say under the castle? Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss? \n", "test3_true": "HOLMES (indicating) Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly morning -- we don't want to keep them standing around too long, do we, Fraulein Hoffmanstal? (Gabrielle looks at him without answering) Come now. It's too late to play cat and mouse. \nGABRIELLE (flatly) Unter dem Schloss. \nHOLMES Thank you. (holding out parasol) Here's your signalling device -- it's a bit damp, I'm afraid -- would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible? (Gabrielle makes no move to take the parasol) No? Then I'll just have to do it myself. (moving toward window) I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion. \nKeeping well to one side of the open window, he extends the parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out a series of long and short signals. \nLAKEFRONT - DAWN \nvon Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the direction of the hotel. \nHOTEL - FROM MONKS' ANGLE - DAWN \nOutside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seen flashing the message UNTER DEM SCHLOSS in Morse code -- but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing the signalling. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nAs Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. Holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room. Then he looks out the window. \nLAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN \nThe monks turn away from the hotel, and with von Tirpitz in the lead, move off along the shore. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nHolmes steps back from the window, faces Gabrielle. \nHOLMES Well, it's up to the good monks now. You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal. \nGABRIELLE You're all wrong about me.   My name isn't Hoffmanstal. \nHOLMES It isn't? \nGABRIELLE It's von Hoffmanstal. \nHOLMES I stand corrected. \nGABRIELLE (glancing toward window) I suppose once they're in the castle... It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap. \nHOLMES It's more amusing than that. Once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance -- it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards. \nGABRIELLE (skeptically) You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump? \nHOLMES Better than that. We're going to let them have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're all expert sailors? And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea. \nGABRIELLE Did you say try to? \nHOLMES I would suggest you get your things together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody. \nHe opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed. Gabrielle watches him for a beat, then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes out. \nGABRIELLE I never had you fooled for a moment, did I? You knew right from the beginning -- when the cabbie brought me to Baker Street. \nHOLMES Let me see -- not quite that soon. \nHe stretches out on the bed. \nGABRIELLE It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know. I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best. I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer game. \nHOLMES Close enough. \nGABRIELLE You're just being kind.   I failed miserably. \nHOLMES We all have occasional failures. Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nWatson, back in his valet's outfit again, comes bounding down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward the door of Holmes' room. \nWATSON Holmes!   Holmes! \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nBright sunlight now floods the room.   Gabrielle, fully dressed, is standing in front of the  mirror, putting on her hat. Her packed bag has been set   out in the middle of the room, and resting on it is the  parasol. \nThe door bursts open and Watson dashes in. \nWATSON Holmes! \nIn his haste he trips over the bag, goes down. As he picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the balcony. \n", "test3_id": 1592}

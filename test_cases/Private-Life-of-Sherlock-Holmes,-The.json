{"train": "THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES \nby \nBilly Wilder and I.A.L Diamond \nTHE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES \nFADE IN: \nBRASS PLAQUE - DAY \nEngraved on it are the words: COX & CO., Bankers. Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker red buses, and other present-day London traffic. \nINT. BANK VAULT - DAY \nAn iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of them switches on the lights. On the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped packages, etc. The guards move along the shelves searching for something. \nWATSON'S VOICE Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death. \nThe guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the cord is the key. \nWATSON'S VOICE It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art -- the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective. \nWhile one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing the dusty contents of the box. \nOVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE. \nThe guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing, and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs; \na sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.; A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see a bust of Queen Victoria. \nOVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE SUPERIMPOSED. \nThe last item out of the box   is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon. The guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER.  Written in   ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph: \nTo my heirs: \nIn my lifetime, I have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes -- dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty. But there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion, I have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date. They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent. \nOVER THIS, WE HEAR THE VOICE OF DR. WATSON, reading the text. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nYORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE - DAY \nA passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century is chugging through the early morning mist. \nWATSON'S VOICE It was August of 1887, and we were returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Colonel Abernetty. \nINT. COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWN \nThere are but two passengers in the compartment -- sitting by the window, facing each other. In fact they are dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness cape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler, a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the seat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on the racks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty- three and thirty-five respectively. \nWATSON'S VOICE You may recall that he broke the murderer's alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BAKER STREET - DAY \nA hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street. \nWATSON'S VOICE He was the most brilliant man I have ever known -- and I dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in Baker Street. \nThe cab draws up   in front of 221B. The front door opens and MRS. HUDSON,   a plump, motherly woman in her fifties, wearing an apron,   hurries down the steps. She greets Holmes and Watson   warmly as they alight. \nWATSON'S VOICE I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating -- as our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest -- bless her kind soul. \nThe cabbie   starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes, Watson and   Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP THE FACADE   OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the bay window   on the second floor. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY \nIt's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, the Persian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair, the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with the cushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and the gasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes' chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the small Moorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; the gas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connecting with the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piled high with papers, clippings, research material, etc. \nHolmes is pulling up the window shades. Watson has removed his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag down on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their luggage, is just leaving. \nMRS. HUDSON I do wish you'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected.    I would have roasted a goose -- and had some flowers for you. \nHOLMES My dear Mrs. Hudson -- criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds. You never quite know when you're going to catch one. \nHe has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, which is on the dining table. \nMRS. HUDSON I'll unpack your bags. \nWATSON (removing diploma from wall) Actually, I'm rather looking forward to it. Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours -- nine to three -- and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, I know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind -- \nFrom the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot. Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by Mrs. Hudson. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAs they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one. \nMRS. HUDSON Mr. Holmes... \nHolmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun. \nHOLMES Please, Mrs. Hudson.    You're in my line of fire. \nWatson jerks Mrs.   Hudson back as Holmes lets go with another shot. The    bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass   and liquid all over the place. Holmes rises calmly from   the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away   in a drawer. \nMRS. HUDSON (outraged) How many times have I told you I will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? I should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall. \nShe points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crown above them. \nHOLMES Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. \nMRS. HUDSON Look at that mess you made -- \nWatson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on his face. \nWATSON It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up -- (hands her the diploma) -- while you unpack my things. \nMRS. HUDSON Unpack? \nHOLMES You heard him. \nA bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass. \nWATSON Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it must've been for you -- \nHOLMES Not really. It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion. \nWATSON You've made me very happy. \nHOLMES I've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond of you, Watson. \nWATSON I know that. But one likes to hear these things occasionally. \nHe notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up. \nWATSON Look at this. Covered with that nasty stuff. I'd better dry it off. \nHOLMES I'll do it. \nHe takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case. \nWATSON For a moment, I was worried that you were going to let me walk out -- that you weren't even going to try to stop me. \nHOLMES Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you here. \nWith a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the violin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics. The ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set. He places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, we STAY on the violin case. \nWATSON'S VOICE It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that. Normally, I was inclined to forgive him... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWatson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table, finishing his coffee. In front of him is a letter, on blue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets. \nWATSON'S VOICE But on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that I would gladly have murdered him -- had it not been for my saintly disposition. \nWatson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and the tickets, rises from his chair. He starts to pace -- addressing Holmes, who is off-scene. \nWATSON Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes? Why won't you go? It's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet -- the house has been sold out for months -- \nHe moves towards the door of -- \nHOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY \nHolmes is sitting in a hip-bath with a high back, soaping himself. Watson appears in the doorway. \nWATSON -- seats are going for a guinea apiece -- \nHOLMES That's precisely it. Why should someone send up two free tickets? Anonymously, at that. \nWATSON Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says -- \nHOLMES This is Dr. Watson. \nROGOZHIN Pleased to meet you. (seating himself behind them) You are enjoying? \nWATSON Immensely. \nROGOZHIN (abruptly) Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health? \nHOLMES My health?   Better consult my doctor. \nWATSON (to Rogozhin) Oh, he's in excellent shape. \nROGOZHIN (to Holmes) Any insanity in your family?   Diabetes? Asthma? \nHOLMES Would you mind telling me what this is all about? \nROGOZHIN Certainly.   Madame Petrova, she has problem. \nHOLMES Could you be more specific? \nROGOZHIN Certainly not. \nWATSON A liason with a crowned head? Compromising letters? Blackmail? \nHe glances toward the stage. \nSTAGE \nThe pas-de-deux finished, to a rousing ovation. \nBOX \nRogozhin rises, turns to Holmes. \nROGOZHIN After performance, there will be little celebration backstage -- and Madame requests your presence. \nWATSON We'd be delighted. \nROGOZHIN (to Watson) You are invited, also. \nWith a parting look he exits, pulling the plush curtains closed. \nCUT TO: \nSTAGE \nThe performance is over, the curtain is up, the party is on. Tables have been set up, with caviar, vodka and champagne. The members of the orchestra are now playing balalaikas, and crew and cast (the ballerinas still in costume, the male dancers in tights) seem in high spirits. \nHolmes and Watson, in silk hats with canes, appear from the wings, stop, survey the scene. Watson's eyes are shining with anticipation. In contrast, Holmes' face is sober and quizzical. \nRogozhin spots the two, detaches himself from a group, hurries over to join them. \nROGOZHIN There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is expecting you in her dressing room. Dr. Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile -- we have vodka, caviar, girls. \nWATSON No, thank you. \nROGOZHIN No girls? \nWATSON No caviar. Makes me break out in hives. \nRogozhin turns to a group of ballerinas, claps his hands. \nROGOZHIN Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki. Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom. \nHalf a dozen ballerinas descend on on Dr. Watson. They are giggling and chattering in Russian. Rogozhin leads Holmes off, while Watson takes in the bevy of beauties around him. \nWATSON Any of you girls understand English? \nGIRLS Nyet. \nWATSON Not one single word? \nGIRLS Nyet. \nWATSON In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos. \nHe pats a couple of the po-pos with his cane. \nBACKSTAGE \nRogozhin is leading Holmes toward Madame Petrova's dressing room. \nROGOZHIN Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you -- this is no ordinary case. \nHOLMES (gallantly) I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight. \nROGOZHIN That is because she is   forty-nine. (he hands her a   glass of vodka, with an   exaggerated smile) So Madame has decided   to leave ballet and spend life bringing up   her child. \nHOLMES How admirable. \nROGOZHIN (hands him vodka) Problem now is to find father. \nHOLMES Oh?   Is he missing? \nROGOZHIN Correct. \nHOLMES And that's why you called me in? \nROGOZHIN Also correct. We must have father, because without father, how can there be child? \nHOLMES I see. The whole thing is still in the planning stage -- \nROGOZHIN Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she is beautiful -- she now needs man who is brilliant. \nHolmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova.    She raises her glass. \nPETROVA Za zdorovie. \nROGOZHIN (raising his glass) Za zdorovie. \nHOLMES Za zdrovie. \nPetrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up.    Holmes takes one swallow, then stops. \nHOLMES What's in it? \nROGOZHIN What does it taste like? \nHOLMES Red pepper. \nROGOZHIN That's what's in it. \nWhile Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own, Holmes takes another tentative sip. \nPETROVA (to Holmes) Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj? \nHOLMES I beg your pardon? \nROGOZHIN Madame wants to know how soon you can be ready. \nHOLMES Ready? \nROGOZHIN To leave for Venice. All arrangements have been made. You will spend one week there with Madame... \nHOLMES Well, this is all very flattering. But surely there are other me -- better men -- \nROGOZHIN To tell you truth, you were not first choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi -- \nHOLMES That's more like it.   The man's a genius. \nROGOZHIN Too old... Then we considered the philosopher, Nietzsche -- \nHOLMES Absolutely first-rate mind... \nROGOZHIN Too German... And we considered Tschaikowski -- \nHOLMES Oh, you couldn't go wrong with Tschaikowski -- \nROGOZHIN We could -- and we did.   It was catastrophe. \nHOLMES Why? \nROGOZHIN You don't know? Because Tschaikowski -- how shall put it? Women not his glass of tea. \nHOLMES Pity, that. \nPETROVA (to Rogozhin) Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem. \nROGOZHIN Madame is very happy with final choice. \nHOLMES Madame mustn't be too hasty.   She must remember I'm an Englishman. \nROGOZHIN So? \nHOLMES You know what they say about us. If there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love-making. We are not exactly the most romantic of people -- \nROGOZHIN Perfect. We don't want sentimental idiots -- falling in love, committing suicide. One week in Venice -- she goes back to St. Petersburg with baby -- you go back to London with fiddle. \nBy now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reaction is slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a new light. And before Watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawns on Watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away from them. \nWATSON Hold on!    Just a moment! \nSpotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him.   The girls shrink away at his approach. \nWATSON (bewildered) What's going on? What happened to the girls? \nROGOZHIN Why?   Do you not prefer it this way? \nWATSON What way? \nROGOZHIN You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told us everything -- about you and him -- \nWATSON About me and him? \nROGOZHIN Come now, no need to be bashful. We are not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual -- but in ballet, is very usual. \nWATSON What is? \nROGOZHIN Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri -- \nWatson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently. It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales. \nROGOZHIN -- And Ilya and Sergei -- (breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth) Sergei -- half and half. \nHe pours himself another vodka. Watson grabs the glass away from him, downs it with a gulp. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT \nIn contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stage party, the room seems doubly placid. Holmes, his dinner coat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wing chair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiar adventure. Only the desk lamp is lit. From the street, there is the sound of hurried, angry footsteps approaching the house. Holmes turns his head languidly -- he knows who is coming. \nEXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT \nAn enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the center of the deserted street. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHolmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that its back is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk, turns the wick down. From off comes the sound of Watson's key rattling in the front door lock. \nSTAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT \nThe front door opens and Watson storms into the vestibule. \nWATSON Holmes! \nHe races up the stairs and across the landing, flings open the door of the flat. \nWATSON Holmes! \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWatson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway. Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from Holmes' pipe. \nWATSON There you are, you wretch! You rotter! You blackguard! Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. What do you have to say for yourself? \nNo answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not -- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes' smoking machine, with the pipe attached. \nWATSON Don't just sit there -- speak up, man! \nStill no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair. Incensed, Watson raises the opera glasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loud thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence. Watson suddenly becomes concerned. \nWATSON Holmes...?   Are you all right, Holmes? \nHe approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves  it aside -- and there on the floor is the smoking machine,  still wheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his   eyes travel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner,  working the bellows with his foot. \nHOLMES From the sound of your footsteps, I gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood. \nWATSON (with renewed fury) How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me? What the deuce were you thinking of? \nHe dashes the smoking machine to the floor. \nHOLMES Watson, you  have my most abject apologies.   But have you ever been cornered by  a madwoman?  It seemed like the only way  to get out of it without hurting her  feelings. \nWATSON What about my feelings? And my reputation? Do you realize the gravity of what you have done? The possible repercussions? \nHOLMES So there'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg... \nWATSON These things spread like wildfire. I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. I'll never be able to show my face in polite society... \nAnd if it ever got back to my old regiment -- you don't know the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut off my pension... \nMRS. HUDSON (looking up) There's a cabbie here -- he says you owe him two-and-six. \nWATSON For what? \nCABBIE (to Watson) For the fare, guv'nor. The young lady doesn't have any money. \nWATSON What young lady? \nCABBIE This one. \nHe reaches out the door, pulls in the young lady in question. She is in her early thirties, with strikingly handsome features, but at the moment she is somewhat worse for wear. She is wrapped in a blanket, her hair is wet, and there is a bruise on her temple. \nShe is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we will subsequently learn, is GABRIELLE. \nWATSON Well.  What have we here? (he starts down the stairs) Who are you, miss? What happened to you? \nGABRIELLE (slight accent) I don't know. \nCABBIE That's all she keeps saying -- I don't know, I don't know. \nThe violin music stops o.s.   Watson has now reached the foot of the stairs. \nWATSON Where did she come from? \nCABBIE From the river. I was driving down the Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the water -- drowning. \nHolmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in his hand. \nCABBIE It wasn't easy, guv'nor -- what with the cold water -- and her fighting me -- \nHOLMES (from the upper landing) Why did you bring her here? \nCABBIE Because I found this in her hand -- (gives a square of soggy cardboard to Watson) -- 221B Baker Street -- that's right, isn't it? \nWatson examines the cardboard, nods. \nHOLMES (to Gabrielle) Young lady -- what did you want at this address? \nGABRIELLE (looking up, trying to focus) I do not remember. \nWATSON (to Holmes) Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say? \nHOLMES Rather. \nCABBIE Well, gentlemen, you want her? -- it's two-and-six -- or shall I throw her back in the river? \nMRS. HUDSON Mr. Holmes.   You can't let him -- \nHOLMES Watson, you'd better accept delivery. \nWatson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them to the cabbie. \nWATSON Keep the change. \nCABBIE Thank you, guv'nor. \nHe snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that her dress is clinging to her damply. \nCABBIE No extra charge for the use of the horse- blanket. \nHe exits into the street, shutting the door.    Gabrielle hugs herself for warmth. \nWATSON You're shivering, my dear. (he puts his arm around her) \nCome along. Let me get you out of those wet clothes. \nHe starts to lead her up the stairs. \nEXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT \nThe cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is mounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about fifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up toward the Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comes abreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansom disappears into the fog. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT \nWatson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace. Holmes is putting his violin down on the table. \nWATSON Sit here, my dear. \nHe settles her in the chair. Holmes comes over, plucks the square of cardboard from Watson's hand. \nWATSON She's suffering from shock and exposure. \nHe starts to massage her wrists to restore her circulation. \nHOLMES Mrs. Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen -- get a towel -- and wipe that look of disapproval off your face. \nMRS. HUDSON Liberties -- in my house! \nShe exits huffily. \nWATSON You can't really blame her -- I mean, the way it looks -- if I didn't know you better, I might suspect you'd taken advantage of the young lady. \nHOLMES As a matter of fact, I did take advantage of her... Would you hand me the butter- knife, please? \nWATSON Of course. \nHe picks up the butter-knife from the table, suddenly turns back with a delayed reaction. \nWATSON You did what? \nHOLMES (taking butter-knife from him) Thank you. \nHe starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the butter-knife. \nWATSON (spluttering) Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are your professional ethics? Have you no sense of decency, no shame -- \nHOLMES None whatsoever. If you must know, I found her body quite rewarding. \nWATSON You cad! \nHOLMES Especially the palm of her right hand. \nWATSON I'd rather not hear about it! \nHOLMES Very well. Then I won't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase. \nWATSON That's her suitcase? \nHOLMES Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it? It was a luggage ticket -- the number rubbed off on her hand. And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train, I concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station. \nWATSON By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity. \nHolmes has now forced open the locks. \nHOLMES Or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers. \nHe opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of clothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with maribou feathers. \nHOLMES Voila! \nWATSON Let's see - what else is in here? \nThey start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase. Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters. \nHOLMES Now we're getting somewhere. \nAs he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty. \nWATSON Who do you suppose this is? \nGabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes' dressing gown. She is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed. Holmes looks up. \nHOLMES Come in, Madame Valladon. (Gabrielle stops) You are Gabrielle Valladon. \nGABRIELLE Yes. \nHOLMES (holding up photo) And this is your husband, Emile Valladon? \nGABRIELLE Yes. \nHer eyes fall on the open suitcase. \nHOLMES Sorry to have ransacked your valise.     But since you came to us for help -- \nGABRIELLE Where am I? \nWATSON 221B Baker Street. \nGABRIELLE Oh, yes... (a beat, as she orients herself) Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is Dr. Watson? \nHOLMES Dr. Watson is the handsome one. \nWatson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache. Gabrielle sways slightly. \nHOLMES That's the way he affects most women. \nHe helps her into a chair. \nWATSON Here! \nHe hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor. Gabrielle is looking around the shop. \nGABRIELLE It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months. \nWatson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object. He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds. \nWhat he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside. \nWATSON Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop? \nHOLMES Maybe. (pointing off) Here comes our letter. \nThrough the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust -- except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back. \nHOLMES Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job -- doing nothing. \nHe reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane. \nGABRIELLE Mr. Holmes -- \nHOLMES Yes? \nGABRIELLE I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames. \nHOLMES It could be worse. You could be at the bottom of the Thames -- much to your discomfort -- and much to my chagrin. \nWATSON I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here. (pointing) No footprints -- just tracks. What does it mean? \nHOLMES I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice. \nThey become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain. \nWATSON (in a frantic whisper) What do we do now? \nHOLMES (unfazed) This way. \nHe leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. They flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open -- concealing them from view. \nRevealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an old BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR (addressing birds) Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I'd forgotten you? \nShe pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Some  of you will be going on a little trip  soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even  an old woman has to live. Although you  might well ask, why? \nShe cackles to herself, glances toward the front door. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Oh.   You never told me we had a letter. \nShe starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. \nThrough a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her. \nThe old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. \nA horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon. As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them. \nFIRST CARTER Morning, Duchess. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR Morning. \nSECOND CARTER What have you been doing with yourself? \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR What do you think? Taking dancing lessons. (she stops in front of the cage) How many do you want this time? \nFIRST CARTER Two dozen. \nHe opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage. \nWOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR What are they doing with all those canaries? What's going on up there? \nSECOND CARTER Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we don't want to know. \nFIRST CARTER When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions. \nThrough the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it. \nWe MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads: INVERNESS COURIER. \nFIRST CARTER (counting as he transfers canaries) ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four. \nHOLMES Jamaican, no doubt -- either Tropical or Golosina -- I'm not quite sure. \nHe and Watson continue toward the study door. \nINT. STUDY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY \nIt is a very elegant room   -- shelves of leather-bound volumes reach to the high   ceiling, there are antique terrestrial and celestial   gloves, scientific instruments in polished brass, marble   busts of English statesmen. \nMYCROFT HOLMES is standing at a refectory table, with his back to the door, engaged in a curious operation. A dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle. As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment. \nMycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years older than Sherlock, impeccably dressed. Behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority. \nThe door opens, and Holmes and Watson enter. \nMYCROFT (without turning) Come in, come in, Sherlock -- Dr. Watson... Sit down. (Holmes and Watson seat themselves) You're looking very fit, both of you. \nWATSON Thank you. \nHOLMES (putting down hat and cane) And how are you, Mycroft? How's your gout? \nMYCROFT Under control. Except for the occasional twinge. \nHe brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes and Watson. \nMYCROFT I have a treat for you -- a very old Madeira -- 1814. There are  only six bottles left in the world.  I have two of them, and am negotiating for a third. \nWATSON If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be -- \nMycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of Madeira. \nMYCROFT The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason. Your very good health. \nHe and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes. \nHOLMES Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us? \nMYCROFT Well, I see you so rarely. How long has it been? Not since the case of the Greek interpreter. (to Watson) Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living in the same town... \nHOLMES In the same town, perhaps -- but not the same world. \nWATSON (taking another sip) Mmmm.    Superb. How old did you say it was? \nMYCROFT 1814.    One year before Waterloo. \nWATSON One year before Waterloo?    Think of that. \nMYCROFT You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor? \nWATSON Belgium, isn't it? \nMYCROFT Quite. (turning to Holmes) And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer. \nHOLMES Yes, I am. \nMYCROFT Well, I can save you a lot of trouble. \nHOLMES I'd be grateful for any suggestion -- \nMYCROFT My suggestion is that you pursue it no further. \nHOLMES Any particular reason? \nMYCROFT Because it involves the national security. We are handling this matter ourselves. \nWATSON We?   Who's we? \nHOLMES The Diogenes Club, of course. \nMYCROFT I didn't say that. \nHOLMES I have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall. \nMYCROFT That's neither here nor there. \nHOLMES It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here, there and everywhere. When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile. When there is trouble along the Indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas, alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman. \nA YOUNG MAN in morning coat and striped trousers comes in, holding a telegram. Mycroft crosses to him. \nMYCROFT (to Watson) What a fertile imagination my brother has. At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her satchel. \nWATSON As good an explanation as any. \nMycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward with it. The young man clears his throat. \nMRS. HUDSON Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand? \nHOLMES (taking gun from her) You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded. \nHe starts up the stairs, followed by Watson. \nWATSON Holmes, you didn't answer my  question. Are you planning to disobey  Mycroft's orders? He's not just your   brother, you know. You'd be defying Her   Majesty's government... \nNo reaction from Holmes. As they reach the landing, Gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of their flat. \nGABRIELLE Any news?   Did you find out anything? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY \nHolmes and Watson step inside. \nHOLMES Let's just say I know what the next step will be. \nGABRIELLE (anxious) Yes? \nHOLMES I want you to pack your things. \nGABRIELLE Where are we going? \nWATSON Holmes, let me caution you --- \nHolmes has put the gun down, and is crossing to one of the book-shelves. \nHOLMES (to Gabrielle) At 7:30 this evening, Dr. Watson and I are going to take you to Victoria Station, and put you on the boat-train. \nGABRIELLE The boat-train? \nWATSON Well, that's better. \nHolmes has taken a railway guide from the shelf and is consulting it. \nGABRIELLE You're sending me back to Brussels?   Is that it? \nWATSON Madame Valladon, you must understand... \nGABRIELLE (to Holmes, agitated) I came here to find my husband -- you were going to help me -- \nWATSON Yes, my dear. But circumstances have changed -- \nGABRIELLE The great detective! Well, maybe this case is too small for you -- \nWATSON On the contrary. It's being handled at a much higher level -- \nGABRIELLE Well, I won't go back to Brussels. Maybe you're giving up, but I'm not. (tears welling up in her eyes) I'm going to go on looking for him. And nobody's going to stop me -- even if they try to kill me. \nHOLMES (looking up from railway guide) Are you quite finished? If you recall, what I said was that we're going to put you on the boat-train -- I didn't say you were going to stay on it. \nWATSON She's not? \nHOLMES At 7:30, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station. At eight-twelve, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by their valet John -- (a glance at Watson) -- will appear at Euston Station, and board the Highland Express to Inverness. \nWATSON Mr. and Mrs.... ? \nGABRIELLE (moving toward Holmes) Thank you. I'm sorry for what I said. (kisses him on cheek) \nHOLMES That's not necessary. \nGABRIELLE (smiling through tears) I'll go and pack. \nShe hurries off toward Watson's room. \nWATSON (acidly) Maybe I should do it, since I'm the valet. \nHolmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf. \nWATSON Holmes, what exactly are you up to? \nHOLMES As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot. \nWATSON But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer? \nWithout answering, Holmes heads for his bedroom. \nWATSON Or the wife of the Belgian engineer? \nHolmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door. Gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a glove. \nGABRIELLE You don't like me very much, do you? \nHOLMES What did you say? \nGABRIELLE I didn't say it -- you did. According to Dr. Watson. \nHOLMES Oh. \nGABRIELLE He gave me some back issues of Strand Magazine. \nHOLMES The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth. \nGABRIELLE Then you deny it? \nHOLMES Not at all. I am not a whole-hearted admirer of womankind. \nGABRIELLE I'm not very fond of them myself. \nHOLMES The most affectionate woman I ever knew was a murderess. \nGABRIELLE Oh? \nHOLMES It was one of those passionate affairs -- at odd hours -- right in my laboratory. And all the time, behind my back, she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie. \nGABRIELLE You mustn't judge all women by -- \nHOLMES Of course not. Only the ones I was involved with. And I don't just mean professionally -- kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my fiancee, for instance -- \nGABRIELLE Your fiancee? \nHOLMES She was the daughter of my violin teacher -- we were engaged to be married -- the invitations were out, I was being fitted for a tail-coat -- and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she died of influenza. \nGABRIELLE I'm sorry. \nHOLMES It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted. (a beat) Good night, Mrs. Ashdown. \nHe pulls the curtain across his berth. \nGABRIELLE Good night, Mr. Ashdown. \nShe closes her curtain, as the train whistle sounds. \nINT. THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - NIGHT \nMost of the passengers in the car have fallen asleep, in various uncomfortable positions, including Watson. The monk beside Watson looks at him, to make sure he's out, then rises and moves toward a monk seated apart from the others. \nMONK (in a whisper) Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness. Die steigen dort aus. Dort muessen wir ihn finded -- den Valladon! \nThe other monk looks up.   Under the cowl we recognize the face of von Tirpitz. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. INVERNESS STATION - DAY \nThe Highland Express is pulling out of the station. As the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the tracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on the platform. A BAGGAGEMAN is loading their luggage on a hand-cart, under Watson's supervision. \nWATSON Let's see -- two, three, four -- \nGabrielle removes her parasol, which has been inserted under the straps of her suitcase. \nGABRIELLE I'll take that. \nHOLMES (to baggageman) How do you get to Glennahurich?    How far is it? \nBAGGAGEMAN Glennahurich? \nWATSON You know -- a valley -- with a yew tree... ? \nGabrielle casually opens her parasol. \nBAGGAGEMAN It's about a mile out of town. (a beat) Why would you be wanting to go there? \nWATSON Well, if it's got a view, it might be a nice place for a picnic. \nBAGGAGEMAN It's got a view, right enough -- but it's no place for a picnic. \nHOLMES Why not? \nBAGGAGEMAN Because it's a cemetary. \nGabrielle looks at Holmes. CAMERA PANS UP TOWARD an iron footbridge, spanning the railway tracks. Moving across it in single file are the seven cowled Trappist monks, with von Tirpitz in the lead. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - DAY \nFrom their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their backs to them. \nWATSON If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers? \nHOLMES Because it's their brothers who have just been buried. \nWATSON Their brothers? \nHOLMES And they're not boys. They're as tall as they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles, will you? \nWATSON Pebbles. \nHe picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men. \nGabrielle and Watson react to the sight. \nGABRIELLE They are -- how do you say it in English? -- nains. \nWATSON Midgets. \nHOLMES (nodding) Boys with the faces of old men... \nWATSON I still don't see -- \nHOLMES Would it help if I told you they were acrobats? \nWATSON Not at all. \nHOLMES Do you remember a tumbling act -- six brothers -- missing from the circus? \nWATSON Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- I completely forgot. \nHOLMES Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper. And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly useless. \nThe four midgets have now risen, and putting on their caps, move off down the avenue. Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson emerge from their place of concealment. \nGABRIELLE (worriedly) Mr. Holmes, is those are not children, then -- ? \nHOLMES Quite. The question now is -- who's in the third grave? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - NIGHT \nThe point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin lid, which starts to give with a squealing protest of nails. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Holmes, standing in the large grave, from which the earth has been removed. Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye lantern. \nHolmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a middle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest, and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding ring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him we have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile Valladon. \nGabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in a faint. Watson catches her. \nWATSON Holmes!   She's fainted. \nHOLMES (preoccupied) Hand me that lantern. \nWatson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shines the beam along the length of the coffin. \nWATSON It is Valladon, isn't it? \nHOLMES Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green -- \nThe lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon's feet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey- white color. \nHOLMES -- and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin. White canaries. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN \nAn open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward the hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby. Watson is sitting beside the coachman. Holmes and Gabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage is strapped to the back. Through the trees which line the road we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by a low-lying mist. \nThe carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which is identified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle get out. \nCLOSE SHOT - HOTEL REGISTER \nHolmes' hand is writing: Mr. And Mrs. Ashdown and valet, London. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nThe MANAGER, in kilts, is just opening the curtains -- disclosing a view of the mist-shrouded lake through the window. \nThe room is on the second floor, and is furnished in a style which has been described as Scotch Baronial -- twin beds with a night-table between them, wardrobe, chiffonier, desk, a couple of chairs, and several mounted stags' heads. \nHolmes and Gabrielle are in the room, Watson is bringing their bags through the door. \nWatson almost drops the telescope in excitement. \nWATSON There it is!    There it is! \nHolmes joins him on the balcony. \nWATSON Look for yourself. \nHe hands the telescope to Holmes. Gabrielle comes up to the window behind them. Holmes trains the telescope on the lake. \nWATSON See it?    See it? \nLOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY \nHolmes' eye slowly scans the lake, but there is no sign of Watson's monster -- just the rolling mist. \nEXT. BALCONY - DAY \nHolmes lowers the telescope. \nHOLMES I see nothing. \nWATSON Nothing? \nHe grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the lake. \nWATSON It's gone. \nHOLMES Gone?   Maybe it was never there. \nWATSON I swear to you -- I saw it -- clear as anything -- \nHOLMES Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the Nineteenth Century -- \nHe steps back into the room. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nWatson comes halfway through the French window. \nWATSON Maybe that grave-digger was right -- the swell, and the boat overturning -- \nHOLMES Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake -- but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation. \nGABRIELLE Asphyxiation. \nHOLMES (holding up wedding rings) There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries -- chlorine gas. \nWATSON That may be. But the fact remains that I saw something out there. \nHOLMES A figment of your imagination. Now let us be logical. The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle -- (picks up guide book from desk, opens it to map) The question is, which castle? \nWATSON You call yourself logical?   You're the least logical man I know. \nHOLMES Am I? \nWATSON How can you say it's a figment of my imagination, when for years you've been saying I have no imagination whatsoever! \nHe looks at Holmes almost triumphantly. \nCUT TO: \nSERIES OF SHOTS - DAY \nHolmes, Gabrielle, and Watson bicycling away from the hotel. Holmes, in knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket, and Gabrielle, holding her parasol, are on a tandem. Watson is behind them, on a bicycle with a picnic basket attached to the rack. He is in his valet's outfit, with metal clips around his trouser cuffs. \nThe three of them bicycling past a long stone wall. \nThey pedal up to an imposing castle.   Holmes dismounts, knocks on the front door. \nOur trio bicycling through a copse of trees. \nThey approach another castle. \nOn a steep road, they ride through a flock of sheep. \nThey are proceeding along a causeway, away from a third castle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE SHORE - DAY \nHolmes and Gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having lunch. Watson is pouring the wine. Their bicycles are resting nearby. \nGABRIELLE If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know... ? \nHOLMES If he's an official guide. \nThey have now reached the wall against which they left their bicycles. Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by the sound of birds chirping. \nHOLMES Listen...   Do you hear anything, Watson? \nWATSON (concentrating) No. Those birds are making too much of a racket. \nHOLMES (looking off) They're not just birds -- they're our old friends. \nWatson and Gabrielle follow his gaze. \nFrom the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown Street. They hand it to a workman, who starts up the steps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass bottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the wooden slate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID - CORROSIVE. \nHolmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are puzzled. \nWATSON Sulphuric acid? \nGABRIELLE The more we find out the less sense it makes. \nHOLMES To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine gas. (a beat) Would you mind clasping your hands, Watson? \nWATSON (obeying) Like this? \nHOLMES A little lower... Thank you. \nWatson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of the nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in the direction of the tower. \nThe workman carrying the canary cage, and the two carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the tower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross the moat and enter the tower. \nHOLMES (looking off) That tower may be more interesting than I thought -- and not just architecturally. \nOut of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two mastiffs on leashes. The dogs start to snarl viciously. \nWATSON Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant here. \nHolmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandem around, starts back in the direction from which they came. Gabrielle follows. Watson hurries after them with his bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder as the dogs continue barking. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOCH NESS - EARLY EVENING \nThe sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is still light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water. \nGabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her parasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill. \nOn the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes, the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in, and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite side of the lake. \nWATSON We have now observed the castle from the front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water... what now?  Are you planning to spend the night out here? \nHOLMES If necessary. \nWATSON You're going to catch your death of cold. (to Gabrielle) Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia? (with an embarrassed chuckle) Sorry. \nGabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen. \nGABRIELLE (pointing off) What's that? \nHolmes and Watson turn their heads. \nAbout half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian neck cutting through the water. \nWatson leaps to his feet. \nWATSON Holmes! \nHolmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat. \nHOLMES Quick, Watson. After it! \nHe grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept the monster.  Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist. \nThe monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter of a mile away. \nSuddenly Watson stops rowing. \nWATSON Holmes, what are we doing?   We should be going away from it. \nHOLMES Keep rowing, dammit! \nWatson resumes pulling on his oar.   As they row, Holmes looks over his shoulder. \nWATSON Ballet? \nHOLMES There's a lake -- and there's a castle -- and there's a swan that isn't really a swan -- or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster -- \nWATSON Then what is it? \nHOLMES What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid, and has an engine for a heart? \nGABRIELLE An engine? \nHOLMES The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument, and water is an excellent conductor of sound. There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster. \nWATSON Oh? \nHOLMES Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs. Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump. \nGABRIELLE You think my husband was involved in all this? \nHOLMES Yes, Madame Valladon.    I'm sure of it. \nWATSON But why would anybody build a mechanical monster? Just to scare people? \nHOLMES Not very likely. \nGABRIELLE Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband? And why was he buried anonymously? \nHOLMES I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to -- the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments -- better known as the Diogenes Club. \nWATSON The Diogenes Club? \nThere is a knock on the door. \nHOLMES Come in. \nThe door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding a magnum of champagne. \nMANAGER Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for you. \nHOLMES (crossing to him) A bottle of champagne? I didn't order it. \nMANAGER No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These are my instructions. \nHe hands the magnum to Holmes. \nHOLMES Instructions from whom?   Deliver it where? \nMANAGER I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs. \nHOLMES Are you sure you have the right Mr. Ashdown? \nMANAGER (flatly) Quite sure, Mr. Holmes. \nHe turns and exits.   Holmes taps the bottle of champagne thoughtfully. \nHOLMES Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act. \nWATSON I don't like the sound of it. \nGABRIELLE Please be careful. \nAs Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into his sporran. \nWATSON You'd better take this with you. \nHe produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes.    Holmes ignores it, exits. \nEXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - NIGHT \nA gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart. Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle. \nHOLMES Who's minding the castle? \nGUIDE You'd better get on.     It's late. \nHolmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat beside him. \nHOLMES Where are we going?    Some sort of party? \nGUIDE You won't be disappointed in the guest list. \nHOLMES Who's the host? \nGUIDE Jonah. \nHOLMES Dead? \nMycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid. \nMYCROFT The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle Valladon. \nHe hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looks at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous Gabrielle. Holmes lowers  the photograph. Behind it, Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance. \nMYCROFT The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night -- apparently fished out of the Thames -- and apparently suffering from amnesia -- is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents. Am I going too fast for one of the \"best brains in England?\" \nHOLMES Go on. \nAs Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked parasol and examines it. \nMYCROFT They planted her on you quite neatly, I must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump. Very much like using a hog to find truffles. And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral. \nEXT. CASTLE - NIGHT \nA coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the door of the coach are the initials \"V.R.\" \nINT. CASTLE COURTYARD \nThe entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops. Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger. \nWaiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, are Mycroft and Holmes. Lined up on the other side of the torch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in their best clothes. \nOut of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty, QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India. She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black. \nMycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her. \nMYCROFT Your Majesty. \nHe bows. The Queen extends her hand to him, and he touches it. \nMYCROFT I trust you had a pleasant journey, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA It was long and it was tedious. And it had better be worth our while, Mr. Holmes. \nMYCROFT I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be. \nA lady-in-waiting and a uniformed equerry have now descended from the coach. Mycroft leads the party up the steps. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen? \nMYCROFT We call it a submersible, Ma'am.    It travels under water. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Under water?    What a fantastic idea. \nThey have now reached the top of the steps. \nMYCROFT Ma'am, may present some of the scientists who were responsible for this achievement. J.W. Ferguson, naval architect -- \nFIRST SCIENTIST (bowing) Your Majesty. \nMYCROFT Professor Simpson, our leading expert on hydraulics -- \nSECOND SCIENTIST (bowing) Your Majesty. \nMYCROFT W.W. Prescott, co-inventor of the revolving periscope -- \nTHIRD SCIENTIST (bowing) Your Majesty. \nMYCROFT And this is Sir Arthur Grisby, our authority on maritime ballistics -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA We don't claim to understand any of this. But England is proud of you, gentlemen. To think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat -- \nMYCROFT (trying to correct her) Well, not exactly, Ma'am -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA -- and underwater plants and coral reefs -- (noticing Holmes) Young man -- what was your contribution to this project? \nHOLMES I'm afraid it was rather negligible, Your Majesty. \nMYCROFT (to the Queen) This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have been following your exploits with great interest. \nHolmes bows, touches the Queen's extended hand. \nHOLMES Thank you, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment? \nHOLMES In a manner of speaking, Ma'am. \nMYCROFT Yes, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Without any warning? \nMYCROFT That is correct, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA And without showing her colors? \nMYCROFT Indeed, Ma'am. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. (Mycroft stares at her) It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will have none of it! \nMYCROFT I beg your pardon, Ma'am? \nHe exchanges a look with Holmes. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Sometimes we despair of the state of the world. What will scientists think of next? \nMYCROFT That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA A dirigible? And what, pray, is that? \nMYCROFT A rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second. \nQUEEN VICTORIA Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that. \nMYCROFT We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border. \nQUEEN VICTORIA (indicating sub) Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the better. \nMYCROFT May I point out, Ma'am -- \nQUEEN VICTORIA And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser. (to equerry) Now we wish to return to Balmoral. \nShe starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows, the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmes linger behind. \nHOLMES Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman. (Mycroft is staring at the sub) What a shame. \nAll that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought. \nMYCROFT Not necessarily. If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them? \nHOLMES Give it to them? \nMYCROFT Invite them aboard for the final journey -- seven hundred feet -- straight down. \nHOLMES And how are you going to arrange that? \nMYCROFT I'm rather counting on you to do it. Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal. \nO.s., the bagpiper resumes playing. \nMYCROFT Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty? \nHe starts up the spiral staircase.    Holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN \nThe gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him, comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance. Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his hand, walks into the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nIn the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed. She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders. The other bed has not been slept in. \nThe door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in, carrying the parasol. \nHe crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol. The he moves to the French window, opens it, glances out. \nLAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN \nThe seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore, silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN \nHolmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a metal lamp-shade overhead. Gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed, clutching her negligee around her. \nHOLMES Sorry about that. But as long as you're up -- what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn't it? \nGABRIELLE (carefully) I think so. \nHOLMES And how would you say under the castle? Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss? \n", "test1_input": "MRS. HUDSON Missing? \nHOLMES Something very crucial. (picks up a small feather) You have been tidying up against my explicit orders. \nMRS. HUDSON Oh, I made sure not to disturb anything. \nHOLMES Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system. By the thickness of it, I can date any document immediately. \nMRS. HUDSON Some of the dust was this thick. \nShe demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger. \nHOLMES (promptly) That would be March, 1883. \nHe blows the feather away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nSTART on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows. CAMERA PANS UP to the top of the chemistry table, on which an elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has been set up. Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at the table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope. \nWatson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure for Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger. \nMrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. The accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough. \nMRS. HUDSON How can you stand this? Why don't you let me air the room out? \nWATSON Please, Mrs. Hudson -- he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash. \nMRS. HUDSON (drily) I'm sure there's a crying need for that. \nWATSON In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar. Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes. \nMRS. HUDSON All of which will end up on my rug. \nShe is now pulling on the rope which lowers the dumbwaiter. \nWATSON That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson. \nMRS. HUDSON (heading for door) All right. If you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate... \nShe exits, shutting the door. For a while, the two go on working. Then Holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry table. \nHOLMES She's right.    I am suffocating. \nWATSON Let me open a window. \nHOLMES Not from lack of air -- from lack of activity. Sitting here week after week -- blowing smoke rings -- staring through a microscope -- there's no challenge in that. \nWATSON Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology... \nHolmes has opened his violin case and taken out his fiddle. \nHOLMES How I envy you your mind, Watson. \nWATSON You do? \nHOLMES It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But my mind rebels against stagnation. It's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built. \nHe has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to improvise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothing amateurish about it -- he plays quite well. \nWatson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly the music stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes has put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard. He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of cocaine, starts toward his bedroom. Watson pushes the writing arm to the side, rises from his chair. \nWATSON Holmes -- \nHolmes   pays no   attention, continues into the bedroom. Watson   crosses   to the open door. Inside the bedroom, Holmes   has put   down the cocaine bottle on the washstand, and is   rolling   up his left sleeve. \nWATSON Holmes, where is your self-control? \nHOLMES Fair question. \nFrom a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes a hypodermic syringe. \nWATSON Aren't you ashamed of yourself? \nHOLMES Thoroughly.    But this will take care of it. \nHe has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, and inserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to draw up the liquid. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BAKER STREET - DAY \n", "test1_true": "WATSON'S VOICE Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes it was opium, sometimes it was hashish. And once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was no telling how long it would last. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY \nRain beats on the windows.    Holmes and Watson are in the middle of an argument. \nWATSON The only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants. \nHOLMES Now, now, Watson -- you mustn't underestimate your other charms. \nHe starts into the bedroom. \nWATSON Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself in there once more -- \nHOLMES I intend to do nothing of the sort. \nHe takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the washstand, starts back into the living room with it. \nHOLMES Not until you replace this needle.    It is getting rather blunt. \nAs Watson glares at him, the door opens and Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in. Holmes hides the hypodermic behind his back. \nMRS. HUDSON I made you some tea and cress sandwiches. \nShe opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull it up. \nWATSON Mrs. Hudson, I want you to pack my bags. \nMRS. HUDSON Are you going away for the weekend? \nWATSON And beyond.   I'm moving out. \nMRS. HUDSON Moving out? (she looks at Holmes) \nHOLMES I'm just as surprised as you are. \nWATSON You heard me, Mrs. Hudson.     And let's not waste any time. \nMrs. Hudson sighs, exits into Watson's bedroom. \nHOLMES May I be so bold as to ask where you'er going? \nWATSON I don't know yet. But I intend to resume my practice. I am, after all, a doctor. And quite a competent one, if I say so as shouldn't. \nHOLMES You'll find it very dull -- snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys -- \nWatson is glancing around the room, searching for something. \nHOLMES If you're looking for your medical bag, you hid it under the Moorish table. (as Watson crosses to it) Which shows a little more imagination than last time -- when it was under your bed. \nWatson picks up the Moorish table, disclosing the medical bag, standing on end. He sets the bag down on the fender, opens it. \nWATSON I will, of course, continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you. \nHOLMES Where am I going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits? \nWATSON (taking hypodermic needle out of bag) Here's a fresh needle -- and here's my farewell present to you. \nHe takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on the mantel. \nWATSON If you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you doing it. \nHe snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom. \nHOLMES Watson... \nWatson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door. Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece. He starts pacing. After a moment he stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above. \nINT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThere are two open valises on the bed. Watson is moving around the room, collecting various odds and ends, while Mrs. Hudson packs his clothes. \nMRS. HUDSON It's so sad. You and Mr. Holmes -- after all these years -- (she sobs) \nWATSON Please, Mrs. Hudson -- none of that. \nMrs. Hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open valise, blows her nose. \nMRS. HUDSON I'll wash this and send it on to you. \nWATSON I'll be at Brown's Hotel. \nMRS. HUDSON (still sniffling) I know how it feels -- I once went through a divorce myself. \n", "test2_input": "HOLMES Where is he? What are you doing in London? \nGABRIELLE I don't know. \nHOLMES When did you arrive from Brussels?     Where are you staying? \nGABRIELLE I don't know. \nHOLMES What happened at the river?   Think! Pensez! Concentrez vous! \nGabrielle bursts into sobs. \nWATSON (stepping forward) That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit you to question her in this condition. (helps the sobbing Gabrielle out of the chair) Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed. (Mrs. Hudson gives him a look) I'll sleep on the couch. \nMRS. HUDSON Come, my dear. \nShe puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying, leads her into Watson's bedroom. \nWATSON I'd better mix her a sleeping potion. \nHe gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag, and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea- cup. \nHOLMES Watson, I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital. \nWATSON Under no circumstances. \nHOLMES She should have medical attention. \nWATSON She can get that from me. But more importantly, she must be protected -- there has already been one attempt on her life. \nHOLMES This temporary amnesia -- how temporary is it? \nWATSON It depends on the extent of the injury. It's like veils shrouding her memory. It could clear up in a few days -- or a few weeks. \nHOLMES Watson, this is a very small flat -- we don't want to clutter it up with women... \nWATSON Holmes, we've never had a case like this. A woman comes to us with a problem -- we don't know who the woman is -- and we don't know what the problem is. Don't you find that challenging? \nHOLMES Quite. But we can't afford to wait for those veils to lift -- we must break through them as quickly as possible. \nWATSON You   really feel it's that urgent? \nHOLMES I do. The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her. \nWATSON Oh. \nHe picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it, carries it toward the door of his bedroom. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BAKER STREET - DAWN \nThe street lamps are still lit. A policeman, on patrol duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his truncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead. Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building, flattens himself against the door. \nFrom the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water- sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as well as the street. \nThe policeman waits till the wagon is past, then steps out of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAWN \nWatson is asleep on the couch, covered with a blanket. He doesn't look as if he were in a very comfortable position. \nINT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN \nHolmes, in a dressing gown, is standing by the window, studying the square of cardboard with the green smudges on it. His bed has not been slept in. \nINT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nGabrielle is asleep in Watson's bed. The door opens slowly, and Holmes looks in. He studies the sleeping Gabrielle for a moment, then quietly pulls the door shut. As the latch clicks into place, Gabrielle awakes and sits up in bed, her back to CAMERA. She is nude. \nGABRIELLE Emile? \nShe starts to get out of bed. \nINT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN \nHolmes is back in his room, once more examining the cardboard by the light of the window. The door of Watson's bedroom opens, and Gabrielle comes out. \nGABRIELLE Emile? \nHolmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway. \nGABRIELLE Emile?   Is that you, Emile? \n", "test2_true": "GABRIELLE (hurrying toward him) Ah, Emile. I thought I'd never find you. (embracing him) Hold me. Hold me tight. (Holmes puts his arms around her) It's been such a long time. So many nights. You know what I did before I left Brussels? \nHOLMES What? \nGABRIELLE I hope you won't be angry with me. I bought myself an expensive negligee. \nHOLMES Did you? \nGABRIELLE (moving toward bed) A pink negligee with maribou feathers. Don't you think that's a foolish thing for a married woman? (she gets into bed, beckons to him) Come. \nHOLMES Where is the negligee? \nGABRIELLE In my luggage... Come here. \nHOLMES (moving toward her) And where is your luggage? \nGABRIELLE (impatiently) I don't know. Come, my love.   Come. Please. \nAs she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoning gesture, Holmes notices something on the palm. He takes her hand in his. There, in the same green ink as the smudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be the letters \"I\", \"O\", and Greek \"E\". Crossing to the wash- stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returns to the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle's hand. \nGABRIELLE What is it, Emile? What are you doing? \nClearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image of the lettering on Gabrielle's palm -- the number \"301\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY \nThe table is set for breakfast, and Mrs. Hudson is opening the curtains, flooding the room with sunlight. Then she moves over to the couch, where Watson is sleeping in an awkward position. \nMRS. HUDSON Dr. Watson! (she claps her hands and he wakes up) Your porridge is getting lumpy. Hadn't you better get up? \nWatson tries to rise, falls back with a moan. \nWATSON I would like to very much. But -- (he turns over on his stomach) Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back? \nMRS. HUDSON Yes, I would. \nWATSON Please!   I'm in excruciating pain. \nMrs. Hudson tentatively rests her knee on Watson's back. \nWATSON A bit higher -- just below my seventh vertebra -- (Mrs. Hudson follows instructions) That's good. Put your arms under mine -- fold them behind my neck -- \nMrs. Hudson presses down harder, and there is a distinct snap. \nWATSON Bless you. (he rises, rubbing his neck) That damn couch. (crossing to table) You'd better see if our patient is awake. \nHe seats himself at the table. Mrs. Hudson crosses to the door of Watson's bedroom, opens it, starts inside, then stops. \nMRS. HUDSON Dr. Watson.   She's gone. \nWATSON Gone? \nHe jumps up from the table, joins Mrs. Hudson, looks past her. The bed is empty. Gabrielle's clothes are in evidence, but there is no sign of her. \nWatson strides towards Holmes' bedroom. \nWATSON Holmes!   Holmes! She's gone! \nHe throws the door open, is about to step inside when he sees something that makes him freeze. \nINT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY \nGabrielle is asleep in Holmes' bed, covered by just a sheet, and obviously naked underneath. Holmes is not in the room. \nMrs. Hudson comes up behind Watson, in the open doorway, peers over his shoulder. \nMRS. HUDSON (scandalized) Well, I never! \nThere is the sound of the hall door opening, and they both turn. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nHolmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, with leather straps around it. Tucked under the straps is a white parasol. And attached to the handle of the suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, in green. \nHOLMES (inhaling deeply) Mmmmm. I smell porridge.   Lumpy as usual, I suppose. \nHe sets the suitcase down on the couch, as Watson and Mrs. Hudson approach. \nWATSON Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just wondering -- how -- (points from his bedroom to Holmes') \nMRS. HUDSON (sternly) We certainly were. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY \nHolmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake through his telescope. Watson appears through the open French window behind him. \nWATSON (excitedly) Holmes, I saw it again -- that thing -- it came from the castle -- it's out there \nLOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY \nA trial of bubbles is moving along the surface. Suddenly there is a muffled explosion from below, and a geyser of water shoots up into the air. \nEXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY \nHolmes slowly lowers the telescope. \nHOLMES It was out there. Now it's gone. \nWATSON Gone? \nHOLMES Forever.   Look for yourself. \nLOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY \nThere is a great turbulence in the water. Up to the surface pops the bottle of christening champagne, with rope and ribbons still attached. Then a copy of the Bible pops up. \nEXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY \nWATSON A bottle of champagne?... and a Bible?... \nHOLMES That's all that's left of H.M.S. Jonah. \nHe steps through the window as a puzzled Watson lowers the telescope. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nWatson follows Holmes in from the balcony. \nHOLMES It would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible. What a fitting end for Trappists -- now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake. \nWATSON (to Gabrielle) Do you know what he's talking about? \nThrough the open doorway comes Mycroft.   In the corridor behind him is one of his aides. \nMYCROFT Fraulein von Hoffmanstal? \nGABRIELLE Yes, Mr. Holmes. I'm all ready. \nMYCROFT If there's one thing I like about the Prussians, it's their punctuality. \nGABRIELLE If there's one thing I dislike about the British, it's their climate. I understand your jails are quite damp -- and your heating facilities totally inadequate. \nMYCROFT They are. But you're not going to jail. You're going back to Germany. \nGABRIELLE Germany? \nMYCROFT You will be conducted to the Swiss-German border, and be exchanged for one of our agents -- a man named Ibbetson. \nGABRIELLE Thank you. \nMYCROFT Don't thank me. Thank my brother.      It was his idea. \nGabrielle looks at Holmes, but he avoids her eyes. \nMYCROFT (to Gabrielle) Frankly, I think we are making a very poor deal. You much better than most operatives working for British intelligence. (turning to Holmes) Don't you agree, Sherlock? \nHOLMES (with a small but gallant bow to Gabrielle) And better than some consulting detectives. \nMycroft signals to his aide, who comes in from the corridor and picks up Gabrielle's bag. \nMYCROFT (to Gabrielle) Shall we? \nGABRIELLE (reaching for parasol) I'll take that. (to Holmes and Watson) Gentlemen. \nShe turns and walks out the door, Mycroft following. Watson's bewilderment has now reached monumental proportions. \nWATSON (folding his arms) All right, Holmes -- you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want to. \nHOLMES I appreciate that, Watson. \nWATSON After all, I'm only your official biographer -- \nHOLMES Anyway, I don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over Strand Magazine. \nWATSON The public has a right to know these things. If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings? \n", "test3_true": "EXT. HOTEL - DAY \nMycroft's aide comes out of the hotel with Gabrielle's suitcase, loads it into an open carriage waiting in front of the entrance. Gabrielle emerges, carrying her parasol, and accompanied by Mycroft. He helps her into the carriage, gets in beside her. \nThe aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off. Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel. \nEXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY \nHolmes is framed in the open window, watching the carriage. Watson comes up behind him. \nWATSON If I promised not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me? As your friend -- as your valet -- \nHOLMES Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal message. \nWATSON A message? \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe carriage is moving away from the hotel. Gabrielle has her parasol over her shoulder, and it opens and closes, opens and closes. \nGABRIELLE - IN MOVING CARRIAGE - DAY \nShe continues to signal with the parasol, unnoticed by Mycroft. \nEXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY \nWatson is straining forward to see out the window. \nWATSON What is she saying? \nHOLMES (slowly) Auf Wiedersehn. \nWATSON Auf Weider---? The nerve! \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe carriage disappears down an avenue of trees, Gabrielle's parasol still flashing its message. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BAKER STREET - DAY \nThere is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up along the curbs. Traffic is light. Householders are shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians are hurrying along bundled up against the cold. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY \nHolmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking jacket, are at the breakfast table. There is snow on the window-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate. Watson is reading the morning paper. Holmes is sorting through his mail. \nHOLMES (holding up envelope) H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club. \nWATSON Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for membership. \nHOLMES If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother. \nHe has slit open the envelope. Watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face remains expressionless. Slowly he puts down the letter, rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out into the wintry street. \nWATSON Aren't you going to finish your breakfast? \nHolmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee. \nThen glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs. It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads: \n9th December, 1888 Dear Sherlock, My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad. \nIt might interest you to know that \nThe page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the other side. \nshe had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs. Ashdown. \nSincerely, \nMycroft \nWatson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table. \nWATSON Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this. \nHOLMES (quietly, without turning) Where is it, Watson? \nWATSON (after a beat) In the files. May to July, 1885. \nHolmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk.   From a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three  files marked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's   the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  three volumes pasted on the bottom. \n"}

The Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie. 
THE RAT I had a really nice time tonight. 
STACY Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck. 
The Rat nods glumly. 
THE RAT I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. 
STACY Do you want to come inside? 
THE RAT Aren't your parents asleep? 
STACY No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. 
THE RAT Okay. Sure. I'll come in. 
We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's face. 
INT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING 
They walk in the front door. The Rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room. 
THE RAT Where's your brother? 
STACY I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? 
THE RAT No. That's okay. 
STACY Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. 
THE RAT Naw. I don't mind. 
Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair. 
STACY Will you unzip me? 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
as the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first time he's ever done anything like that. 
STACY (CONT'D) Thanks! 
She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her room open. 
STACY (CONT'D) You can come in, if you want! 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
He is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's room. 
INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to notice. 
THE RAT So... pretty nice house you've got here. 
STACY Thanks. So... (puts hands on hips) What do you want to do? 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
as he struggles with the memory of Damone's words. "Always call the shots." 
THE RAT I don't know. 
STACY Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? 
THE RAT Sure. 
Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him. Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her. He almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly... 
STACY This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? 
THE RAT (looking pained) Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan. 
Her knee grazes him again. Does she expect something? 
THE RAT (CONT'D) Look, Stacy, I want you to know that... 
The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is woeful as he completes the sentence. 
THE RAT (CONT'D) ... I've got to go home. 
STACY Do you really have to go? 
THE RAT Well... it's getting kind of late.

ABEL Please. Don't get going on this. We are a big new house. He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. The alarm will be in on Monday. It was some kid. They aren't coming back. 
She looks at him with considerable concern. 
He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first then gives in. 
INT. TRAINING ROOM AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - NEXT MORNING 
ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element. He is a salesman. 
ABEL What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. But now... 
He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white handkerchief. 
ABEL (CONT'D) When this door opens you begin to close. It must always be spotless. If they see you have ever done this before it is over. 
He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Now, you do this and only this... You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. Very very slowly and small. (MORE) 
ABEL (CONT'D) Don't look up at them. Just at the cloth. Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise. 
INSTRUCTOR Do you hear that noise... that's the noise. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX What noise? 
ABEL It means you are close... Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. And whatever it is you always take the fancy option. 
INSTRUCTOR Can I get you a coffee or tea? ABEL A tea please. 
INSTRUCTOR We have some homemade lemonade or a soda. 
ABEL I'd love a lemonade, thank you. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Why? 
ABEL Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. 
Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD FRONT DESK) comes to the door. 
STANDARD FRONT DESK They need you. 
ABEL I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. And that's never easy. So to get them over the line you need to close them. So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them... 
ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You stare longer than you should. Because this is not a joke. You will only keep this job if you close. And that's not funny to you. And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth. 
ABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a long beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well... it was great to meet you. Welcome and I wish you luck. 
ABEL walks out of the room and straight into. 
INT. LARGE STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY 
There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the drivers have company meetings is very basic. 
The room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in. He stands aside. 
STANDARD FRONT DESK Trucks 16 through 23 you should be ready to go... 
As STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps. ABEL Good morning. First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. So, on that front we have these. He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ANDREW comes into the room behind ABEL and stands. 
ABEL (CONT'D) These will be in every truck by the end of the week. Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the BACK) Yes, Eddy. 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY I have heard that the union is considering recommending other more active options for us to consider. Do you know about this? 
ABEL looks to ANDREW. 
ABEL We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time. 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY So this radio is what we got? ABEL Yes. 
EXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY 
ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house. CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. 
ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions. 
ANNA Catherine... Catherine. Katie!

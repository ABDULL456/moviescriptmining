MRS. CUSHING Would you wait a moment, please. I'm on the phone, can't you see I'm on the phone? (rummaging through a stack of charts, large paper forms in quadruplicate) ...Of course not, do they ever? (hangs up, takes two charts from the desk, pushes through the waiting line) Would you mind, please. I have to get through, do you mind? 
She makes her way to the door and goes out into... 
EMERGENCY AREA, ENTRANCE LOBBY 
...which is congested. Mrs. Cushing enters... 
EMERGENCY, ADMITTING AND TREATMENT ROOMS 
NURSE (on phone) Give me that one again... thirty- two? 
Facing the desk are six curtained treatment rooms, mostly open to view. Behind the desk are a supply room and another treatment room. Both are occupied, the former by a PARANOID LADY wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to by a very patient young intern. 
PARANOID LADY They follow me everywhere. Three big black men. Naked, completely exposed. Right in the street. Hanging down to their knees. Disgusting. They're waiting out there for me now... 
...and in the other room, a man in his thirties is being treated for some sort of head lacerations. In one treatment room, the Chief of Emergency Service, DR. SPEZIO, a man in his late thirties, along with an intern, an anesthesiologist and a nurse, is bent over a naked and comatose young black woman of eighteen, covered somewhat with a sheet. She's a junkie, being intubated, i.e. a small endotracheal tube has been inserted into her mouth. This is the most melodramatic of the varied activity here. 
A middle-aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed in another treatment room; a nurse attends him. 
An asthmatic middle-aged woman sits in still another room being administered her 500 mg. of amenophylene subcutaneously. 
The curtains on another room are drawn for privacy. On chairs in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held in his lap. 
A young mother with a five-year-old daughter with a badly cut arm is being attended to by the back wall. The Emergency Room Nursing Supervisor, MISS ARONOVICI, a pretty woman in her mid-twenties, is sterilizing the little girl's wound. 
Mrs. Cushing makes her way to Miss Aronovici. They detest each other. 
MRS. CUSHING Did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named Mitgang? 
MRS. ARONOVICI (continuing to treat the little girl) The concussion? 
MRS. CUSHING I don't know. They just called me. They said you didn't fill out the chart. And where do you come off sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay? 
Miss Aronovici turns to Mrs. Cushing, regarding her sweetly. 
MRS. ARONOVICI Sally, would you get the fuck out of here. The patient's in the Holding Room. You want his Blue Cross number, you go in and you get his Blue Cross number. 
Mrs. Cushing elbows back through the line of patients waiting at the Admitting desk. 
MRS. CUSHING Do you mind, please... 
There are now three nurses behind the desk, all of them on phones. One nurse calls to Dr. Spezio. 
NURSE O.P.D. wants to know how that asthmatic they sent down is. 
DR. SPEZIO (just leaving the group around the junkie) She's fine. We'd like to keep her here a little while. 
Spezio heads for the door where he is intercepted by Mrs. Cushing. 
MRS. CUSHING May I see you a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind. 
DR. SPEZIO (sighs, calls back to the triage nurse) I'll be right back. 
He goes out, followed by Mrs. Cushing, into... 
EMERGENCY AREA, LOBBY 
Spezio and Mrs. Cushing move between laundry and supply carts. 
MRS. CUSHING (thrusting some papers at the doctor) If you don't mind, Doctor, is this your handwriting? 
Spezio stops, sighs, examines the paper.

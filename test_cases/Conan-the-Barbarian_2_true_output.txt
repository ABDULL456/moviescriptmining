CORIN Go. There is a hunting lodge in the North Pass with provisions. 
CONAN No! I will fight! 
Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face. Corin's eyes are half-crazed. 
CORIN This fight is over, but yours has just begun. You wanted to be a warrior of the tribe, Conan--now you must be its last. 
CONAN Father, I am not afraid to die. 
CORIN Good. Make your death have purpose. 
BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again, BOOM. 
A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away the bolt. 
In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and -- 
THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a crisp. 
Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his back. 
Corin falls to his knees. 
CONAN No! 
Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support beams. 
Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan, pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from his fallen father. 
Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow. 
KHALAR SINGH (O.S.) I said I wanted a word with him. 
Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge. Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier, grinning from ear to ear. 
Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold. 
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) As promised. 
PICT (strange dialect - SUBTITLED) Their heads. You promised me their heads. 
KHALAR SINGH All you wish, once we are gone. 
The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh stares down at Corin, sizing him up. 
Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge. 
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) I take no pleasure in this day, barbarian. Your people are fierce warriors, deserving of every story told of them. But now you must choose the story for yourself. I am Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked from the best Hyboria. My second, Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo and his Shadow Scouts from the jungles of Zingara. And countless others. They all had a day like this one. They all chose a way forward. 
Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice. 
Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to give his son away. 
CORIN What is it you want? 
KHALAR SINGH I seek neither gold nor steel, but flesh and blood. The last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years. 
Corin LAUGHS. 
CORIN Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each man is free here. 
KHALAR SINGH But I seek a woman. 
Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians women are being herded by the slavers. 
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) A queen in hiding. Point her out and you'll spare the lives of your own. Perhaps even your wife? 
CORIN My wife was killed, long ago, by swine such as you. 
Khalar nods, understanding. 
KHALAR SINGH Then our stories began in the same place, Cimmerian. I too lost my wife to marauders. How many men, in how many lands have suffered so? The only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown. That is the legacy I seek. Will you join me? 
It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his tongue, unmoved. 
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D) Very well. Then death will be your story. Your men will die. And your women too, when I am done with them. None will survive to carry your name forth, and over time, even your enemies will forget you ever were. You will be wiped from the pages of history. (to his men) Take your blood, but leave the kill.

He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside. 
LOUIS Why do you do this Lestat? 
LESTAT I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah! 
He stands up. The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical. She looks at Louis. 
GIRL It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me out! 
LESTAT Of course it's a coffin. You're dead, love. 
Louis screams at Lestat 
LOUIS Lestat - finish this - 
LESTAT You finish her - if you feel so much - 
The girl grabs Louis and pleads. 
GIRL You won't let me die, will you? You'll save me? 
LESTAT But it's too late, love. Look at your wrist, you breast. 
He picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing. 
LESTAT Unless I make her one of us... 
LOUIS NO!!! 
LESTAT THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!! 
The girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears. Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck. She dies at last. 
A terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis. 
LOUIS My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from... 
LESTAT In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you. 
Louis leaves without a word. 
EXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT 
A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another. Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind, walking down the street, gripping one, then another. 
LOUIS (V.O.) Am I damned? Am I from the devil? Is my very nature that of a devil? And all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed. 
A smaller side street, in which every house is marked with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis is following them. A man passes with a lantern. 
MAN Don't go that way Monsieur. It's the plague. Go back the way you came. 
Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to himself. 
LOUIS The way I came... 
He walks on, following the rats. 
LOUIS (V.O.) ... and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying. 
A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it. 
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
A little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair. 
CLAUDIA Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm frightened, please wake up. 
As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes are being eaten away by rats. 
Louis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis. 
CLAUDIA Monsieur, please help us. Papa's waiting for us at the ship. Please wake mama, Monsieur. 
She runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face. 
LOUIS (V.O.) And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity for her gaunt face? Why do I wish to warm her tiny arms? Comfort her beating heart? 
She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck. 
Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon. Gradually another sound replaces it. 
LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. 
Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway.

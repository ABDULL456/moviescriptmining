(BACKING AWAY) You didn't get here in time. My game is dead. 
(FOCUSSING) You murdered my game. 
VINOKUR 
(LAUGHS) No, just your pod. I replicated the entire contents of your pod when I fixed your nerve boards. They're in safe-keeping. They're all in one piece. 
GELLER You copied eXistenZ? 
VINOKUR (soft, pleading) Allegra, come over to Cortical Systematics. Yes, yes, Cortical Systematics. I'm defecting and so are all the Antenna Research top brass, Pellatt, Melzack, Sherrin, everybody good. 
GELLER You're a spy for Cortical Systematics. 
PIKUL 
(CONFUSED) Wait a minute. Cortical Systematics is just the qame version, it's only... 
I 9 
VINOKUR 
TIGNORING PIKUL) Not a spy, exactly. I think of myself as a personnel exchange engineer. If you want to be reunited with your creation, you'll come over to us. eXistenZ, by Allegra Geller. Only from Cortical Systematics. 
GELLER 
(DEFIANT) Only from Antenna Research. 
VINOKUR But why stay with them? Look at that mess down there. How could you trust Antenna again, when they've endangered you like this? Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from him. 
GELLER (referring to cashier) You know, this guy was actually going to kill me. Vinokur looks to Pikul for support. 
VINOKUR 
(TO PIKUL) Can you talk to her? I mean, we can take you with us too. But before Pikul can respond, Geller, now sitting next to the cashier's body on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with the submachine gun. Vinokur falls with a startled expression on his face. Pikul, absolutely horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the weapon out of her hand, picks it up himself. 
PIKUL What the fuck are you doing?! You've killed him! Are you gonna kill me next? 
A- 
GELLER 
(LAUGHS GIDDILY) C'mon, Pikul. He's only a game character. And I didn't like the way he was messing with my mind. 
PIKUL 
(SUDDENLY CALM) Didn't you? You didn't like that and so you killed him? 
GELLER He was only a game character.

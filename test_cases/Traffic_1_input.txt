CAROLINE Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci section or Banal Love Songs of the Nineties? 
Seth looks at her.  He has a crush. 
SETH Banal Love Songs it is. (hits keys) Hey, you wanna try something? 
She nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand pulling her past the stoned people on the couch -- 
IN THE KITCHEN 
Seth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water. Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the flame under the spoon. 
CAROLINE What are you doing? 
SETH (concentrating) Just watch. 
He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles. 
He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He hands it to Caroline. 
SETH Inhale the smoke and hold it. 
CAROLINE What is this, like freebase? 
SETH Not like.  It is. 
He lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle crackles and pops, then starts to smoke -- 
SETH Go...  Go! 
There's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most of it. 
SETH Hold it. 
She pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely. 
SETH See... Now, you see. 
Caroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as she can. 
Finally she exhales -- 
CAROLINE More. 
The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY 
The White House CHIEF OF STAFF meets with Robert Wakefield. The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor. 
This is a man you do not want to disappoint. 
CHIEF OF STAFF Until you officially take over the office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or having someone in the room.  There are a lot of interests in this town and, right now, they're all scared of you.  The reason they're scared of you...technically, you have veto power over their budgets.  So think about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna want to speak to you.  And that's the good news... You'll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a specially prepared question.  Their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart.  If you lecture them, they won't think you respect them.  If you respond with utter humility, they will.  Remember, this is about your respect for them, and the President's respect for them. Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up. (beat) It'd probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor.  I'll have Jeff Sheridan take you over. Also, four weeks from today you will give your first official press conference.  In it you will outline the President's strategy for winning the war on drugs. (beat) Okay, anything else? 
ROBERT I'll be sure to let you know. 
INT. EXECUTIVE BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY 
Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who has found his place. 
SHERIDAN I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you. 
ROBERT Like you protected Landry? 
SHERIDAN I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for. 
INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY 
Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier with a sense of humor. 
Landry is putting some personal items in a box. 
GENERAL LANDRY Jeff, you want to excuse us for a minute? 
Sheridan nods and leaves. 
GENERAL LANDRY (bemused, off Sheridan's exit) Functionaries.  Nice people, the Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes all they do is start rumors. 
Robert and Landry shake hands. 
ROBERT You've done a fine job here, Sir. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it. 
Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere. 
GENERAL LANDRY I'm not sure I made the slightest difference. (wistful) I tried...  I really did. 
ROBERT There are a lot of encouraging statistics.  The work's just started, but I intend to see it through. You've got my word on that. 
GENERAL LANDRY You're here for two years, three maximum.  What'd they promise you? Court appointment?  What?  District? Appeals? (checks Robert's reaction) Not Supreme... Supreme? 
ROBERT I've come in to do a tough job and that's what I'm going to focus on. 
General Landry SIGHS. 
GENERAL LANDRY When Kruschev was forced out, he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor.  He said "When you get into a situation you can't get out of, open the first letter and you'll be saved.  And when you get into another situation you can't get out of, open the second."  Soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place.  So he opened the first letter.  It said, "Blame everything on me."  So he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm. (beat) He got into another situation he couldn't get out of, so he opened the second letter, which read, "Sit down and write two letters." 
They stare at each other a beat.  Then Landry smiles.

EXT. MANOLO'S STREET, MEXICO - DAY 
A cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the street.

BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between the Bug's legs. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward out of harm's way. 
The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration. 
JAY What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand and fight like an arthropod! 
In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto its back, trying to drag it down. 
JAY (CONT'D) You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe you're a badass in your hive, but this is New York City. You're just another tourist here! 
The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet through the air. 
Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage. 
But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at the Bug, extending his arm at the creature. 
JAY You're messing with the wrong species, Bug -- 
He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He flicks it off... 
Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster... 
Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces. 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage... 
Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects... 
JAY Hey, Bug! 
CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH. 
ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound. 
ON JAY. He smiles. 
JAY (CONT'D) If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of yours. 
He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot over another roach. 
CRUNCH! He crushes another one. 
JAY (CONT'D) Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you know, here's your old Uncle Bob! 
He steps forward again -- CRUNCH! 
ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes. 
INT. BUG - NIGHT 
Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun... 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY - NIGHT 
Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds his foot over another one. 
JAY What's that? Can you hear what he's saying? 'Help me! Help me!' 
CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving toward Jay. 
ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on, poising his foot over another roach. 
JAY Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who that is! 
The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up. 
BUG Don't do that! 
Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up, straight at the Bug's head. 
JAY That's your Momma! 
He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares up at him, unflinching... 
JAY (CONT'D) Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off more than you can chew? 
and at that very moment...

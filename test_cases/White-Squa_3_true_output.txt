Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down with their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great mainsail starts to rise. 
LAWFORD Tie it off!! 
SKIPPER (to Bill) Outer. 
BILL Outer Jib! 
CHARLIE (confused) Outta what? 
Coached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist the jib. 
SKIPPER (to Bill) We'll bear off to port and run down wind. 
BILL Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward. 
The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George, John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing. 
Lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the others move into their positions.  When Bill sees the yardarm crew is in place... 
BILL Unstop the squares! 
YARDARM CREW Unstop the squares!! 
SKIPPER (to Chuck) Fall off to port.  Ease her around to a heading of northeast.  Sing out when you're there. 
As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward. 
Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails. 
CHUCK (in a whisper) Ah... Northeast... sir. 
SKIPPER (barking) Speak up boy! 
Chuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out. 
CHUCK Northeast sir! 
SKIPPER Unfurl the squares! 
Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with the added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position. 
Chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty of the canvas that the Albatross carries. 
BILL Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail! 
SKIPPER Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water. 
CHUCK Yes, sir. 
SKIPPER All stop on the engine. 
BILL All stop on the engine! 
Bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves it to the stop position. 
SKIPPER Behold gentlemen.  The power of the wind! 
As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed. Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a magical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer. 
SKIPPER Did we lose anybody? 
ALICE Not yet. 
LONG SHOT 
The Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful image of another time.  And yet, here she is. 
ON DECK 
Each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment. Music builds. 
SKIPPER Chart us a course for the windward side. 
Alice considers his request. 
ALICE That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there. 
SKIPPER It's time these boys saw some real blue water. 
EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER 
The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is fierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well. 
The crew has never seen mountains of water like this. Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear life.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains perfectly dry. 
SKIPPER Well... now that I have your undivided attention... I'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points... 
TERRY (aside) This guy is certifiable... 
PHIL Suicidal... 
SKIPPER The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up. 
Caught, Terry and Phil button up. 
SKIPPER Second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr. Butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges.  He's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over. 
Skipper directs the next comment directly at John.

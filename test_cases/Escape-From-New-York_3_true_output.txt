DRUNK (to the tune of Joy to the World) Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . . 
SNAKE All right, get your machine ready.  I'm coming out. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK 18 hours, Plissken. 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT 
SNAKE Listen to me, Hauk.  The President is DEAD, you got that?  Somebody's had him for dinner! 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK Plissken, if you get back in that glider I'll shoot you down.  You climb out, I'll burn you off the wall.  You understand that, Plissken? 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT Snake stares at his walkie-talkie. 
SNAKE A little human compassion . . . 
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT Snake walks on.  He's in an area with streetlights.  He keeps going. 
EXT. POD -- NIGHT Snake stares at the pod.  No clues.  He looks around.  Nothing.  As he comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily.  He touches his neck.  It's like he can feel the cores dissolving. 
A crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what he's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole covers start to rise up.  He runs off. 
EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows. 
INT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT Snake backs into a corner.  The floor is weak and starts to go out from under him once.  He gets into the shadows.  There's someone there. 
GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS You a cop? 
Snake levels his gun at her. 
SNAKE No . . . 
GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS You've got a gun.  You got a smoke? 
Snake tosses her his cigarettes.  She lights one.

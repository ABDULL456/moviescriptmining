JACKSON Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson? 
KEYES Yes. 
JACKSON Then my answer is no. 
KEYES What do you mean no? 
JACKSON I mean this is not the man that was on the train. 
KEYES Will you swear to that? 
JACKSON I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon. And if I say it, I mean it, and if I mean it, of course I'll swear it. 
KEYES Thank you. 
Keyes turns to Neff. 
KEYES There you are, Walter. There's your proof. 
Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson. 
KEYES Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen. 
JACKSON Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased indeed. 
NEFF How do you do. 
JACKSON Very fine, thank you. Never was better. 
KEYES Mr. Jackson, how would you describe the man you saw on that observation platform? 
JACKSON Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man, about ten or fifteen years younger than the man in these photographs. 
KEYES Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't he, Walter? 
NEFF Fifty-one, according to the policy. 
JACKSON The man I saw was nothing like fifty- one years old. Of course, it was pretty dark on that platform and, come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me. But I'm positive just the same. 
KEYES That's fine, Jackson. Now you understand this matter is strictly confidential. We may need you again down here in Los Angeles, if the case comes to court. 
JACKSON Any time you need me, I'm at your entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses paid, of course. 
Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it. 
KEYES Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office. 
Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he says. 
JACKSON (To Neff) Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff? 
NEFF Never. 
JACKSON Wait a minute. Do you go trout fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way. 
NEFF Nope. Never fish. 
JACKSON Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the name. There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis. 
NEFF No relation. 
JACKSON Let me see. This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable man, too, I'm told. 
Keyes rejoins them at this point. 
KEYES All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you go down to the cashier's office -- room twenty-seven on the eleventh floor. They'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight. 
JACKSON Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit me better. There's a very good osteopath down here I want to see before I leave. 
Keyes has opened the door for Jackson. 
KEYES Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put her on the expense account. 
Jackson doesn't get it. 
JACKSON Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure. 
He goes out. 
KEYES There it is, Walter. It's beginning to come apart at the seams already. A murder's never perfect. It always comes apart sooner or later. And when two people are involved it's usually sooner. We know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else. Pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is. He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet. Their emotions are all kicked up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. They can't keep away from each other. They think it's twice as safe because there are two of them. But it's not twice as safe. It's ten times twice as dangerous. They've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop. They're stuck with each other. They've got to ride all the way to the end of the line. And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery. 
He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches. 
KEYES (Continued) She put in her claim and I'm going to throw it right back at her. (Pats his pockets again) Have you got one of those? 
Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of his hand and lights his cigar.

CIRQUE DU FREAK

FADE IN: CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS. Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider. As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR appears from the bottom of frame. Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops, suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg tentatively through the air... 
DARREN'S VOICE Come on... Just a little lower... WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over his head, is DARREN SHAN. Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent. The spider just hangs there. 
DARREN Come on... I'll take good care of you. All the bugs you can eat. 
MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren, Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble. Maybe that's why they're friends. 
STEVE Hey, Darren! No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can see any feet in front of the bowls. 
STEVE Did you fall in? Darren! 
DARREN'S VOICE Shhh... Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up. INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall. 
DARREN You're gonna scare him away. 
STEVE Man, we're getting killed out there. It's three to nothing. Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little. 
DARREN Your problem, Steve, not mine... Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet. WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling. The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve who flashes a wicked grin... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist: 
STEVE GOAL! Three to one! The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball. Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP! Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal. 
STEVE 
(EXULTANT) Three to two! Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult. 
STEVE What does that prove? Huh? The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them. 
DARREN Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2. Lunch's almost over. 
STEVE That's why he kicked it. To kill time. Well, I still got time to kick your face. 
DARREN 
(BLOCKING HIM) Forget it. The ball. Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief. 
GOALIE Thanks, Darren. He's crazy. Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak. 
THE STREET Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street. From seemingly out of nowhere... A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out. It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS. 
STEVE You idiot! The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren. But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off. A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve notices, snatches it out of the air. Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear down the street. Creepy... 
STEVE Look at this. The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20 - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor. 
STEVE .Human oddities and other living curiosities... 
(TO DARREN) Other. Does that mean not human? 
Darren shrugs, takes the flyer. 
DARREN A freak show. Ever been to one? 
STEVE

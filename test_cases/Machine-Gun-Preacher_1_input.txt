And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out. He leans over and torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him. 
INT. DORM - NIGHT 
The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the younger ones whimpering, starting to cry... the darkness becoming too much... reminding them of past horrors... and then we hear a FAINT VOICE in this dark room... singing quietly... an ancient African lullaby... and then other little voices joining in... singing this song they all know... a song their mother's once sang to them... 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
... Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in the dark... listening to the children sing. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING 
A SLOW DISSOLVE... life springing up in the camp... daylight breaking... a routine seen here... Betty, Rose and the other camp women arriving at the orphanage... cooking fires being lit... soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a long night... 
... and Sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag... discovering William curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in the dirt... been there all night. William stirring awake, seeing Sam above him and scrambling to his feet. 
SAM Mornin, buddy. 
William, no response. Just staring up at him. 
SAM (CONT'D) Ain't you gonna say nuthin? 
William, nothing. 
SAM (CONT'D) Ok then. 
And Sam walks across the compound followed by William a few paces behind... and he reaches Deng, Betty, Nineteen, and a few of the other volunteers waiting by the truck... 
DENG (MEANING WILLIAM) Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard. 
SAM Guess I do. 
Sam tosses his bag into the back, says goodbye to everyone... 
SAM (CONT'D) Take care of things while I'm gone, ok? 
DENG I will, Preacher. 
They shake hands and Sam gets into the truck... and we see William already here, sitting in the backseat. 
SAM You can't come with me, buddy. 
DENG (to William, Arabic) Get out of there. 
But William isn't moving... 
DENG (CONT'D) (ARABIC) Come on! -- out! -- 
... and finally Deng reaches in and grabs him... tries to pull him out but he fights back... yelling as Deng drags him out of the truck... 
INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY 
Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound... and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms... and finally he breaks free and SPRINTS for the truck as it drives off... fast as he can... chasing Sam until he no longer can. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH/KITCHEN - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah!"... and then Sam's voice over it all... 
SAM (O.S.) In your actions you give service to the Lord... 
INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - SAME 
Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the congregation listening in rapt attention... 
SAM ... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom! 
Ad-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie and Paige in the congregation listening... as we go -- 
INT. HALLWAY/FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY 
Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen little children running around this playroom... 
LYNN We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue? 
VOLUNTEER Good. Hey Pastor. 
SAM Sue. 
Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner rehearsing for a Christmas play... 
SAM (CONT'D) Been thinkin we need to put up a playground. Swings. Some things the kids can climb on. 
LYNN We can't build anymore. Not for awhile. 
SAM You said Sundays has been full. 
LYNN Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money. (MORE) LYNN (CONT'D) Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow. Times is tight. 
SAM Be good for them kids, Lynn. 
LYNN They got the playground over in Cairnbrook. And they can play at the school on weekends if they want 
Sam turning to her -- 
SAM Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange. 
Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in Africa.

EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945) 
ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning three steps of a front stoop. 
INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) 
TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a crossword puzzle. 
A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter. 
Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets. Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays. 
A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat. 
EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945) 
A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley. 
INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945) 
A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in a pool of blood on the tablecloth. 
INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) 
A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family War..." 
The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE has fallen asleep on his arms at the table. 
SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses. 
The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods appreciatively. 
MAN Nice Augie...nice. 
EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46) 
Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb. 
Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile. 
Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette. 
One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up. 
The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks. 
SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes. 
He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car: 
DRIVER Pick up your sister? 
SONNY Yeah. 
The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars. 
INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46) 
He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again. 
CONNIE'S VOICE Who is it? 
SONNY It's me, Sonny. 
We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him. 
SONNY (tenderly) Connie, what is it? 
He turns her around in his arms. 
Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment. 
CONNIE (desperately) It was my fault!  I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me.  He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. 
Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe. 
SONNY I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. 
He starts to leave. 
CONNIE Oh Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't. 
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly. 
SONNY Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do? Make your kid a orphan before he's born. 
She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves. 
EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET 
CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. "Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball. 
CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we recognize that it is SONNY. 
His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has CARLO by the throat. 
He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand. 
SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned. 
SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon. \nTed gags on his spaghetti. \nELAINE I just can't go on living with a man who refuses to deal with reality, Ted.  I have to go now.

A DETECTIVE kneels beside the body which now has a chalk mark around it. \nSERGEANT (lookind down at Detective) When is this senseless killing going to stop? \nDETECTIVE HALLICK Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a pattern here.  This is the 12th victim this week with a chalk mark around the body.  I want this whole area cordoned off!  I want everyone in this terminal booked and beaten until they talk.  I want an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I want the entire population of Hawaii off that rock and into the water within one hour. \nHallick stands up and finds the area surrounded by 30 accordian players playing \"Lady of Spain.\" \nDETECTIVE HALLICK Sergeant.

McCrosky stops him. \nMcCROSKY Get me a readout on their fuel capacity. \nCONTROLLER 3 Yes, sir. \nCONTROLLER 4 Here's all the available information on the sun.

(spotting Jacobs) Jacobs, I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now! \nJACOBS First the earth cooled.  Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best TV special on Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with Albania.  Then... \nMcCrosky leaves Jacobs babbling. \nMcCROSKY Things sure haven't changed. \nMcCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself. Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand loosens the tie, he drinks coffee with the other, a cigarette dangles from his lip. \nINT. CABIN - CLOSEUP OF TED \nHe is lost in thought.

CABIN - ANOTHER ANGLE \nElaine stands over Ted looking at the empty bottle of stress pills. \nELAINE My God. \nStella approaches in nurse's uniform splattered with blood. A cigarette dangles from her lip.  She wipes her hands on a blood-splattered towel. \nSTELLA He's finally come to terms with his own psychosis. \nELAINE But he was right!  He's not crazy! \nSTELLA Miss, I'm a nurse with a dying F-A-T-H-E- R, I know what I'm talking about.  Now I'm going to need fresh sheets, gauze, Q-tips, and all the vaseline you have on board! Now! \nElaine leaves, looking back at Ted with empathy.  Mary passes. \nSTELLA (to Mary) I'll need all the boiling water you can get your hands on! \nMary leaves and a MAN passes holding a tattered arm. \nEXT. ANOTHER DARK STREET - CLOSEUP OF TED \nstanding, looking at a bar.  The glow of flashing neon sign reflects off his face.  He pulls out a cigarette.  A woman's hand shoots INTO FRAME holding a lit zippo.  Ted draws deeply on the cigarette. \nTED (V.O.) There I was, minding my own business when I looked up and saw a pair of legs that went forever. \nANGLE ON WOMAN'S FEET \nPAN UP AND UP AND UP.  She is all legs -- no torso, no head, just legs -- about two stories high. \nTED (V.O.) But I had a date with Harry's.  It was little more than a hole in a wall on the south side of Chicago. \nANGLE ON A HOLE \nbashed in the side of a brick wall.  A neon sign over the hole reads, \"HARRY'S GOODTIME BAR.\" \nINT. HARRY'S \ndark, smokey bar.  PAN very tough faces standing along the bar. \nTED (V.O.) Harry's was perfect for me.  The kind of place you go if you don't want to be recognized. \nKEEP PANNING tough faces, but now they all wear Groucho glasses and noses. \nTED (V.O.) It was rough, real rough. \nANGLE ON POOL TABLE \nwith four players -- all have broken thumbs in casts. \nTED (V.O.) The kind of place you could score anything, from junk... \nOne guy hands another guy a large, rusted car fender for money. \nTED (V.O.) ...to Phil Donahue's book. \nPHIL DONAHUE signs a stack of books at a table. \nTED (V.O.) At Harry's you could count on a fight breaking out almost every night. \nTWO PROFESSORS argue at a table. \nPROFESSOR 1 And I say essence precedes existence. \nPROFESSOR 2 You're crazy!  Existence precedes essence. \nPROFESSOR 1 Essence! \nPROFESSOR 2 Existence! \nProfessor 2 slugs Professor 1 sending him flying across the room.  Professor 1 gets up and throws a judo chop which Professor 2 stops by holding a book up in both hands.  The book splits in two like a piece of wood split by a karate chop. \nTED (V.O.) There was a small trio in one corner. \nTwo midgets play light jazz -- piano and bass. \nTED (V.O.) And a larger trio in the other corner. \nFive 300-pound musicians play some tune in another corner. \nANGLE ON TED AT BAR - CLOSEUP OF TED \nHe pulls out a cigarette.  A bare foot with zippo held in toes comes INTO FRAME and lights it. \nTED The last thing I wanted was Elaine to see me down on my luck.  Well, it was just my luck.  In she walked with a group from the space program. \nANGLE ON DOOR \nElaine and Simon and two other couples, who look like clean- cut NASA types out of \"The Right Stuff,\" walk in laughing and take a table. \nTED (V.O.) They'd come to Harry's to slum it and try their hand at the video bull. \nThe group prod Elaine to try the bull.  A cowboy hat flies across the room.  She grabs it, pulls it on, and moves to the bull which is surrounded by others in cowboy hats. Elaine hops in the saddle.  A sinister character puts a quarter in and madly flips knobs. \nSFX:  VIDEO GAME \nThe saddle doesn't move -- all the action is on the screen but Elaine throws one hand back and kicks her legs. \nTED (V.O.) Elaine made that ride look easy.  It was obvious why I was still nuts about her. She loved life.  I didn't want her to notice me so I borrowed a pair of dark glasses. \nTed takes a pair of dark glasses off a passing blind man who walks perfectly until the glasses are gone, then starts stumbling and crashes over a table. \nTED (V.O.) Grabbed an alto sax and joined the group. \nTed takes an alto sax from a passerby who also stumbles and crashes over a table when he loses his sax. \nTED (V.O.) I stayed in the background not wanting to draw attention to myself. \nEveryone looks around trying to see where the terrible grating sax sound is coming from. \nTED (V.O.) Then what happened?  Elaine's crowd talks her into joining us for a song. \nElaine hops up on the stage, grabs a mike and starts to sing \"Stormy Weather.\"  She sidles up to Ted and goes into a medley of old songs. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHOURS LATER \nElaine's singing is just as bad as Ted's sax.  They have cleared the joint and play and sing alone.  Elaine's group finally pull her out.  She hasn't recognized Ted. \nELAINE (to Ted) I don't know who you are or how you lost your sight, but I'll never forget this night as long as I live. \nPULL BACK leaving Ted alone on the stage still playing. Chairs are turned up on tables.  One table has chairs turned up with the people still sitting in the chairs. \nSTELLA (to a male passenger) I'm afraid that leg's going to have to come off. \nA leg is passed to her from OUT OF FRAME.  She takes it while still looking at the chart. \nSTELLA Wait.  This isn't your chart.  You just had a touch of air sickness. (handing him back his leg) You'll be fine. \nA WOMAN sitting next to the MAN WHO IS HOLDING HIS LEG grabs Stella. \nWOMAN I'm terrified. \nSTELLA (shakes her hand) And I'm a nurse.  Everything will be okay. Pass it on. \nThe Man with the leg passes it to the passenger in seat behind. \nMAN WITH LEG Everything will be okay.  Pass it on. \nThe leg gets passed from seat to seat as passengers say, \"Everything will be okay.  Pass it on.\" \nCLOSEUP OF TED \nlying unconscious in a corner.  A puppy crawls INTO FRAME and starts licking his face.  LOOSEN TO FIND Jimmy standing over Ted.  Ted comes to, feels his jaw and pulls himself up. The ship jolts. \nJIMMY Are you feeling okay, mister? \nTED I'm feeling just fine, son.  Just fine. \nTed pushes by Jimmy, a look of great purpose on his face. \nINT.

I want you to listen to me and listen good. \nThe buyer checks out the baggie -- it's mostly twigs.  The seller is trying to explain the situation with his hands. \nMcCROSKY Twenty years ago I helped a young pilot through a storm over Chicago. \nThe buyer grabs the seller's shirt and tries to get cash back.  A fight ensues. \nMcCROSKY He didn't have a crew either.  He said he couldn't do it.  But when the going got tough that kid pulled it together. \nThe seller's shirt is ripped.  Knives are pulled. \nMcCROSKY You might have read about him; he made all the big papers and the Canadian Jewish News. \nThe seller is stabbed. \nMcCROSKY I don't know where he is today but if he was up there right now, I know he'd find some way to turn that bucket around and get the hell out of there, pronto! \nANGLE ON JACOBS \nJACOBS I wish I could talk like that -- so macho yet so sensitive. \nANGLE ON McCROSKY'S BOOK - \"PEP TALKS FOR ALL OCCASIONS\" \nMcCrosky slams it shut. \nMcCROSKY I just hope I said the right thing. \nTED (V.O.)

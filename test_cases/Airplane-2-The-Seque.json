REAR OF TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT \nSARG (imagine George Kennedy), dressed in a tuxedo, tie undone, with a huge cigar, which he eats during the conversation, talks to his wife on his car phone.  A worker in hard hat waits next to him.  Behind the worker are fuel drums and a large sign that reads:  DANGER, FUEL -- ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING, ABSOLUTELY NO SPITTING. \nSARG (on car phone) Marge, you better go without me.  We've got a condition red. \nSPLIT SCREEN WITH WIFE AT HOME. \nMARGE (in evening gown, a cigar stuck in her mouth) We've got a condition red with our marriage.  I think you're in love with that shuttle, not with me.  I want a divorce, Sarg. \nSarg lights his cigar. \nSARG Is there someone else, Marge?  Is that it? \nSarg throws the lit match towards the \"ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING\" sign.  The worker grimaces but nothing happens. \nMARGE Sarg, there's been someone else for fifteen years.  You were just too involved in your work to see it. \nThey hang up.  Sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits it in the direction of the \"NO SPITTING\" sign, blowing the worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.  Sarg hops into his car, takes a Lava lamp from the seat and puts it on the car roof -- like Kojak's flasher.  The lamp flashes, the SIREN WAILS, as Sarg pulls away. \nINT. SARG'S CAR - ON THE MOVE - NIGHT \nHe thinks about his wife.  SPLIT SCREEN FLASHBACK OF THEIR BEDROOM.  Marge, a cigar in her mouth, is in bed with five football players -- other half-clad athletes (hockey, baseball, wrestling, basketball) line up for their turn at her.  Sarg has to climb over them to kiss her goodbye. \nSARG Don't wait up for me, sweetheart.  We're testing the retro-rockets tonight. \nMARGE You just can't see it, can you, Sarg. \nSARG We'll talk tomorrow, hon.  I promise. \nEXT.

It's a pretty long trip to Mercury. \nA PORTER approaches. \nPORTER Can I help you folks? \nJOHN (handing him a bag) Thanks. \nPORTER (noticing Scraps) Is that your puppy, son? \nJIMMY Yeah, his name is Scraps and he's going to Mercury with us. \nPORTER No dogs are allowed on the shuttle, son. \nJIMMY But they said... \nPORTER (pulling out a handgun) Scraps will have to be shot.  I can do it for you here if you like. \nHe SHOOTS. \nJIMMY Scraps!!! \nPORTER (laughing) Just joking.  Blanks.  See, Scraps is fine. \nAlice, John, and Porter crack up while Jimmy cries. \nALICE It was just a joke, Jimmy. \nAlice and John look at each other as if there is something wrong with their son. \nANGLE ON MAN WITH CAGE \nA man lifts a large dog cage out of the trunk of a taxi. Inside is another man dressed in S&M leathers. \nMAN WITH CAGE (to Man in Cage) If we can't fit you under the seat, you'll just have to be locked up with the luggage. \nThe man in the cage seems to relish the latter suggestion. Two Porters lift the cage onto a conveyor belt next to Jimmy's dog. \nEXT. GANTRY - NIGHT \nSarg stands beside the burnt panel on the side of the shuttle.  He is eating another cigar, holding a burnt wire, and talking into a walkie-talkie. \nSARG There's no way this wiring could have passed inspection without Simon Kurtz's okay! \nSPLIT SCREEN OF KRUGER IN HIS OFFICE \nKRUGER (on phone) Just patch up the damage and get that ship ready to fly.

GANTRY - NIGHT \nSarg looks at the wire and shakes his head. \nSARG (to worker) Ted Striker was right six months ago when he test-piloted this sucker.  And what did he get for telling the truth?  A one-way ticket to Palukaville. \nSarg spits a chunk of cigar on the ground, blowing the worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION. \nEXT. WILD BLUE YONDER - DAY \nA jet fighter streaks across the sky. \nINT. JET - DAY \nTED STRIKER is at the controls.  His oxygen mask hangs loose from his helmet.

Ted lies on the bed soaked with sweat, a drink in his hand, a cigarette dangling from his lip.  He takes a drink and, forgetting to remove the cigarette, swallows it without batting an eye.  LOOSEN to find a CRUCIFIX above the bed with a real person on it. \nTED (V.O.) (to self) Who could have figured it would come to this.  It'll be twenty years this week that I lost my entire squadron over Macho Grande.  Planes, too. \nSUPER:  DOG FIGHT FOOTAGE \nVOICE You're too low, Striker!

We HOLD on them.

Elaine. \nELAINE (turning around) Te...! \nTED That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk. \nSimon pulls Elaine away.  They all walk and talk. \nELAINE Ted, we've been worried sick ever since you escaped from the Ronald Reagan Institute For The Mentally Feeble. \nThey walk faster.  The b.g. starts whipping by as if they're running.  Wind blows in their hair. \nTED Are you on the Mercury mission? \nSIMON That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return. \nThe b.g. moves faster.  The wind gets stronger.  They pass a marathon refreshment stand and are handed wet sponges and cups of Gatoraid. \nTED It's got to be stopped! \nELAINE But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out. \nTED I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why. \nSIMON You're still crazy, Striker.  Come on, sweetheart. \nSimon pulls Elaine away as she looks back with empathy. \nELAINE What did Ted mean? \nThey leave Ted standing. \nSIMON Elaine, he's still sick. \nANGLE ON TED \nThe wind is still blowing in his hair even though he stands still.  Ted has a FLASHBACK. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ROCKET HANGAR \nTed, in flight coveralls, follows after Simon who is overseeing the operation. \nSIMON You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker. \nTED (holding wire) Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures. \nSIMON You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications. \nTED I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown. \nA NEWSPAPER BOY passes. \nNEWSIE Shuttle test pilot goes mad! \nA TECHNICIAN -- JACOBS -- enters with drawings of flight outfits. \nJACOBS Sir, these are the designs for the flight uniforms.  I think the captain's is to die. \nSIMON (with drawings) Good, good, no, no, good.  What's this?! I said no studded dog collars, Jacobs. \nJacobs grabs the drawings and leaves in a huff. \nTED You won't get away with this, Simon! \nTed turns to leave and bumps right into Elaine.  She holds him. \nELAINE Ted, what's wrong? \nTED (pulling away from her) Ask Simon. \nIn b.g. a car is parked by a huge rocket engine.  A worker opens the hood and strings jumper cables to the rocket.  A sign above rocket reads, \"ROCKET ENGINE TEST AREA.\" \nELAINE Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground. \nTED There's nothing wrong with me! \nELAINE Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti. \nTED You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! (ranting) It's all here in the design specifications!

Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. \nELAINE (crying on Simon's shoulder) Simon, why has he become so... so... \nSIMON So mentally ill? \nElaine collapses on Simon's shoulder, sobbing.  Simon smiles evilly.  The technician with the jumper cables, b.g., signals the driver to start the car.  The car revs and the rocket fires. \nDISSOLVE BACK TO: \nSCENE \nTed still standing alone and muttering. \nTED (to self) I'm perfectly sane. \nTed notices Stella Barrington looking at him. \nSTELLA Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help? \nTED Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing. \nSTELLA You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington. \nTED Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? \nSTELLA Yes.  He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury. \nTED I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go. \nSTELLA You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand. \nTed leaves. \nINT. TERMINAL - OUTSIDE DRUGSTORE \nSIMON Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. \nELAINE (checking her watch) Don't be too long. \nSimon walks into the drugstore past a DRUGGIST who whispers to him: \nDRUGGIST Uppers, downers, coke, speed, hash, Tampax. \nANGLE ON ELAINE \nTed approaches.  We see light flashes from a 25\u00a2 photo booth. \nTED Elaine. \nELAINE Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself. \nA WOMAN IN BLACK GARTER BELT emerges from photo booth followed by a donkey. \nTED Elaine, what happened to us? \nELAINE Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \nThe Druggist hands Simon a huge bottle of pills.  The label reads, \"ANTI-FEAR PILLS.\" \nSIMON (looking at the label, \"ANTI- FEAR PILLS\") What does this word mean? \nDRUGGIST (looking at label) 'Fear,' to be afraid or over-anxious. \nSimon swallows a handful of pills, braces himself and walks out right through the plate glass window without feeling a thing. \nINT. TERMINAL \nTed is still following Elaine. \nTED Elaine, someone has to listen to me.  I'm going right to mission control. \nA kid bops by with a huge (5'x3'x2') oak cabinet, TV/stero console perched on his shoulder. \nMUSIC:  DISCO. \nELAINE Ted, you should go right back to the hospital. \nElaine leaves and Ted has another FLASHBACK. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

JANE Saw what? 
JAKE That I'm still in love with you.   I admitted it, I told her about us and I've left her. For you. 
JANE No, no, no.... What do you mean??? Jake, this is crazy! (worried the kids will hear, whispers) Are you telling me the truth? 
JAKE (nods) This feels so right Jane. 
As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her PJ's, looking confused. 
GABBY (from the porch) What's going on? 
JANE Nothing. Honey, set the table, I'll be right in. 
GABBY Mom, you're the only one who cares if the table's set. 
JANE Okay, then do it for me....just go in please. 
Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch. LUKE What's up, Dad? 
JAKE Having some problems on the home front, just wanted to talk to your Mom for a sec. 
Jane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley joins the Kids. LAUREN Problems on the home front?   Is one of you seeing someone else? 
Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake. 
JAKE (off Jane's cue) No, it's nothing like that. I just need to find a hotel or something for a few days `til I get my head together. 
GABBY It's that serious? 
Jake nods. 
LUKE Mom, can Dad stay here for a few days? He can share my room. 
JANE I don't think that's the best idea, Luke. 
GABBY Daddy, are you crying? 
93   ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP                                 93 He turns away from the kids.   The tears could be for dramatic effect, could be real. 
JAKE I'm sorry. 
All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane. 
LUKE (begging) Mom........ 
97   EXT. FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER              97 Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been lifted. His energy is in full bloom. 
JAKE Mommy's the best cook in the world! 
98   EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - LATER THAT DAY                     98 Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.    She looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face. 
JAKE Thank you for saving me Janey. 
JANE Jake, you knew the kids were all here. Shouldn't we have talked about this? Agreed this was the right thing to do? This is so typical. Only thinking about works for you. 
JAKE I'm sorry, I guess I should've called before showing up. 
JANE -- And I'm not sure you even left Agness. Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out...

ANGLE ON MASTERS MASTERS Will Mr. William Babowski please come forward. BB walks over to the defense table and sits down. MASTERS You have the right to have a lawyer present if you so wish. BB I do not wish. CUT TO: 
149   EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY                               149 Tilley walks down the street toward his car. Suddenly he realizes that there's an empty space and his car is gone. Tilley's a little confused, thinking that perhaps he parked elsewhere. A YOUNG BLACK KID walks up to Tilley. (CONTINUED) 
149   CONTINUED:                                                 149 KID Did you have a car parked here? A Cadillac? TILLEY Yeah.   What about it? KID A man told me to say they took it. TILLEY Who took it? KID Man said, the tax man.     Gave me a dollar to tell you so. Tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where his car had been. TILLEY Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low can you get? How low can you get? He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear. He mumbles to himself. TILLEY They're lowlife. How can people come and take a man's car?... His Cadillac? CUT TO:

The hearing is continuing with BB at the defense table, and Stanley watching. MASTERS I think with the number of violations on your record, Mr. Babowski, this commission has no recourse but to revoke your state license. 
CAMERA ON STANLEY MASTERS    (O.S.) Would you please drop    off your license with the clerk    of the commission on your way    out. (CONTINUED) 
150   CONTINUED:                                             150 BB BB (leaning into the microphone) Thank you. BB gets up and walks to the back of the  room. He stops at the same desk as Tilley, but instead  of going into his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches  into his suit pocket, pulls out a license document and  tosses it onto the table. Then he heads out the door. CUT TO: 
151   EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY                                 151 BB walks down the street, making for his car. He sees Tilley still standing in the vacant parking space. Tilley sees BB. BB stops. BB Sorry about your license. TILLEY Yeah.   You in there? BB Yeah.   They got my license as well. TILLEY Sorry to hear it. BB What are you doing standing there? 
TILLEY This is where my car used to be. BB Stolen? TILLEY I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits! Thieving sons of bitches! BB looks at Tilley for a beat. BB You need a ride uptown? TILLEY I could use one. (CONTINUED) 
151   CONTINUED:                                            151 BB Come on. They cross the street and go toward BB's Cadillac. BB gets in the driver's side, Tilley gets in the passenger side, and the car pulls out. CUT TO: 
152   INT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY                              152 BB's driving and Tilley's in the passenger seat. TILLEY Some bullshit commission, huh? (beat) Tell me, where's it written it the Constitution that says you can't hustle for money? Where's it written? It ain't like I went into an alley and hit a guy over the head with a brick and stole his money... not like I broke into somebody's house and stole his stuff. All I'm doing is selling... where's the crime in that? BB I don't know what the world's coming to. TILLEY You're telling me. I don't know what the world's coming to.

KIT You smoke Pall Mall? 
HOLLY Yeah. 
He is surprised to discover this. 
KIT Nah, you hadn't seen me when I'm going after something, honey. Tough? 
He cocks his head just thinking about it. She reaches for the radio to change the station. He pats her hand away. 
KIT Hey. don't touch that... Nat King Cole. 
EXT. BADLANDS - NIGHT 
They dance in the headlights to the tune of "A Blossom Fell" coming over the car radio. She is wearing the rich man's jacket. After a moment Kit whispers in her ear. 
KIT Boy, if I could sing a song like that... I mean, if I could sing a song about the way I feel right now, it'd be a hit. 
They continue dancing. 
EXT. CADILLAC ON PLAINS - DAY 
Two shots of the Cadillac heading across the Badlands at dawn. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Kit knew the end was coming. He wondered if he'd hear the doctor pronounce him dead, or if he'd be able to read what the papers would say about him,the next day, from the other side. He dreaded the iea of being shot down alone, he said, without a girl to scream out his name. 
INT. CADILLAC - DAWN 
Holly yawns with fatigue. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Then, for an instant, the sight of the mountains in the dawn light got his hopes back up. 
Kit shakes his head with admiration and wonder. 
KIT God, what a sight... Tell me this, honey. What does a little Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that? 
She turns to look at the mountains. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - THEIR POV 
Mountains in the distance closer now than ever before. 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT. OIL RIG 
The Cadillac drives up to an oil rig. Kit gets out of the car. 
KIT Love this air. 
The ROUGHNECK in charge of the rig steps out of his trailer. It seems there is nobody else around.

Nels is nodding.  Nodding. 
NELS I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate. 
SUSAN MARIE Carl never lied. 
NELS Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude. 
And then.  As if it had just occurred to him... 
NELS Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you? 
SUSAN MARIE He had no reason to. 
NELS Carl ever say he got one? 
SUSAN MARIE I can't speak for him. 
NELS You can speak for what he said. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks... 
HOOKS (O.S.) Objection, badgering the wi... 
CLICK.  All the lights in the courtroom go OUT.  A loud murmur.  A FLICKER of light.  Then, they go OUT again. 
The crowd BUZZES, laughs, the gavel RAPS.  The lights come ON.  A collective sound of relief.  The gavel AGAIN.  Finally, silence. 
NELS Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques... 
SUSAN MARIE Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore. 
A silence.  A deep one. 
NELS The question is more about the defendant's attitu... 
SUSAN MARIE That's all he said. 
She arches her throat. 
SUSAN MARIE And we can't ask him anymore. 
INT. ISHMAEL'S DESOTO, CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT 
Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry fields of Center Valley. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) My father had bought the DeSoto fifteen years before.  Driving it reminded me of him.  Which I considered a neutral fact... 
He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for his convenience. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Actually, it was pleasant. 
Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Snow made all the fields into one. The notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no sense. 
Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) But I knew such things occurred. Having been to war and all. 
The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind them.  And gets out. 
He crunches over to where Hisao works... 
ISHMAEL May I give you folks a lift? 
Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair from her eyes. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) I didn't look at her.  I thought that would be best. 
Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side. Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face Ishmael... 
HATSUE My father is grateful for your kindness.  But he will free his car, shortly. 
Ishmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel. 
ISHMAEL Okay, I'll help. 
INT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT 
Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him. 
ISHMAEL I know it's caused you trouble. But don't you think the snow is beautiful, coming down? 
His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet hair pasted against her cheek. 
HISAO Yes, very beautiful. 
Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart away.  Hers hold. 
HATSUE This trial is unfair.  You should write about that in your newspaper. 
He keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road. 
ISHMAEL (calmly) What should I say? 
HATSUE Just that.  This trial is wrong, they are calling a good man a killer. It is only about prejudice, and that is unfair. 
He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him. 
ISHMAEL We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t... 
HATSUE I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper. 
And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror. 
ISHMAEL Maybe I should write a column. What do you think? 
She studies his face. 
HATSUE What do you think? 
No smile.  On either side. 
ISHMAEL I think people.  Should be fair.

SHERIFF I'm the what? 
TOM AND JIM 
Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water. 
HANK 
Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try it again. 
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT 
PHIL For twenty years you've been -- 
SHERIFF For twenty years I've been eating shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! From now on everything I eat is gonna be shit-free! 
BEHIND THE CRYPT 
Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then... 
WAYNE AND HANK 
Come around on both sides. 
TOM 
Starts shooting at them with the two pistols. 
WAYNE AND HANK 
Pull back. As they go... 
TOM 
Sees... 
KAREN'S ARM 
Draped over the side of Wayne's boat. 
TOM 
Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne. 
CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT 
Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and grabs... 
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK 
And pulls it out of the boat. 
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT 
SHERIFF Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do you want me to draw pictures? 
Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff. 
PHIL I can't let you do it. 
SHERIFF Oh for -- (beat) Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna go. I'm gonna hear one of two things out of you. Either I'm gonna hear you say you're in with us, or... (moves close to Phil's gun) ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me. 
Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales. 
SHERIFF (one hand) Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or... (other hand) ...you kill me. Your choice. 
The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, lowers the gun. 
SHERIFF There we go. 
SOMETHING 
Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. It's... 
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK 
And it starts sinking in the water. 
BEHIND THE CRYPT 
Tom sees... 
JIM 
Haul himself into the ski-boat. 
WAYNE (O.S.) In the boat! 
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK 
Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat. 
JIM 
Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire. 
TOM 
Starts swimming for the boat. 
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK 
See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when... 
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK 
Explodes and...

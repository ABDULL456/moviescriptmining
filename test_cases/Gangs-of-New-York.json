{"train": "NEW YORK CITY 1844 \n8 EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE) \nThe same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look (MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city. The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points . The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square. Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor. The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the creaking of masts in the winter WIND. \nCUT TO \n9 EXT. HARBOR DAY \nA closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: \"IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness. Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current, each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle. \nPOLICEMAN Where's your family, sonny? \nJohnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him. \nJOHNNY (lilting brogue) My mother's just there. \nHe gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, they are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside. \nJOHNNY On the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was three others fighting for her bed. \nPOLICEMAN And your father? Where's he, then? \nJOHNNY I never knew him. \nPOLICEMAN (taking Johnny's hand) \nWe better see to you, then. \nCUT TO \n10 EXT. STREET NIGHT \nThe Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the Five Points. \nPOLICEMAN Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points. But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery and the Bowery. Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face. \nPOLICEMAN Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to sport. But there's places to put up a boy on his own. \nThree WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall. Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces. \nJOHNNY And those? What are those? \nPOLICEMAN Well, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of... \nWe SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE. \nPOLICEMAN ... sort of whatnot. \nTRANSVESTITE Say, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend. \nThe Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick. The Transvestite screams and falls ... and Johnny RUNS. \nPOLICEMAN Hey! \nBut Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life. \nCUT TO \nINT. MORTUARY NIGHT \nA funeral chapel. \nVallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the Dead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends down and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam. \nHAPPY JACK We passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to carry all this, and carry you a while, too. \nHe stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket. \nAMSTERDAM Where will my father rest? \nHAPPY JACK Potters Field, with everyone else. \nAMSTERDAM My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in fresh ground, facing east. \nHAPPY JACK What difference where he faces? \nAMSTERDAM He'll face east for the second coming of Christ. \nHAPPY JACK Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there. \nThe Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director who resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling a lovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand. The woman is obviously drunk, the girl frightened. \nMR. CORNELIUS Will you have music, entlegen \nWOMAN (MAGGIE) My daughter'11 do any song you like. \nHAPPY JACK Not tonight, Maggie, we got... \nMonk Eastman interrupts from the Background. \nMONK How much? \nMAGGIE Any ned in your pocket, sir. \nMONK hands MAGGIE some coins. \nMONK She sing sweet as she looks? \nMAGGIE Pure celestial, sir. (to girl) Go on, Jenny. \nAMSTERDAM Later. \nHe turns with the plank in his hand and starts to RUN back through the crowd. \nJOHNNY Hey! \nJohnny manages to GRAB the other end of the plank. But Amsterdam's so strong he YANKS him right along. The Crowd YELLS as it parts for Amsterdam, who CHARGES through using the plank like a battering ram, with Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and momentum... ... toward Mr. Cornelius' window. Amsterdam SHATTERS the window and the Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS. Amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin, which falls over, spilling Vallon's BODY, knocking the boy over. Amsterdam picks himself up as Johnny stands frozen. \nAMSTERDAM Help me. \nHe starts to pull his fatherls body from the window. \nAMSTERDAM Come on! Help me, goddamn it! \nIn a daze, Johnny steps forward and HELPS Amsterdam pulls the body onto the street. \nNow: the SOUND of WHISTLES and WHEELS and RUNNING HORSES as a wagon full of POLICE arrives on the scene. Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling insults. \nThe police RUN toward the window. Mr. Cornelius dithers at the front of the crowd. \nAmsterdam and Johnny exchange a look. Then Johnny RUNS for it. Amsterdam stays with the body... \n... as the cops close in, SWINGING clubs. Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a couple of times. The Crowd yells. A COP swings his arm back to give Amsterdam a good wallop... \n... and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Easy, crusher. What's this all about? \nCRUSHER Ask the boy. \nAMSTERDAM I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to wait on a permit, but he only wanted time to... \nBILL picks up the Tammany sign from the ground. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising. (to cop) Better go along. I'll see to all this. \nCOP The boy... \nBILL THE BUTCHER Take the little malefactor. The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Give the boy what he paid for. \nCUT TO \n17 EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nAmsterdam is HURLED into the police wagon. The door is locked behind him. He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window, SEES ... \n... Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight. \nThere are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same advertisement: \"Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!\" A SILHOUETTE ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby. Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side for good measure. Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind. \nAnd across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window. The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall. \nCUT TO \n18 INT- TOMBS DAY \nA huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum. Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other PRISONERS, all of them older than he. At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way. AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to hear... \nPRISONER Ain't his first Tombs trip. \nANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him. \nJAILER What do they call you? \nAnd this is the first time in the film we have heard his name. \nAMSTERDAM Amsterdam. \nThe JAILER looks him over. \nJAILER Your full name. \nAMSTERDAM Vallon. \nThe JAILER writes this down with a scratchy pen. \nJAILER First name? \nAMSTERDAM I told you. \nJAILER (skeptical, resigned) Address? \nAMSTERDAM Got none. \nJAILER I'll put city. Now what's your age? (Amsterdam shrugs.) Maybe twelve. Got a family? \nAMSTERDAM No more. \nJAILER Well, where was they from when you had one? \nAMSTERDAM (beat) City. \nJAILER (writing) Disrobe. \nAs Amsterdam obeys, the Jailer turns to the Cop in the leather helmet standing at his side. \nJAILER What's the charge, Asbury? \nCOP Theft. Assault. Creating a ... \nBOSS TWEED But you don't understand at all. \nBill keeps walking. \nBOSS TWEED There's a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow streets. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (turns now) You just stay out of my place. \nBOSS TWEED Yes, alright. Gladly. It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver. \nBill waits for Tweed to continue. But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage. \nBILL THE BUTCHER It's good work. \nBOSS TWEED As far as it goes. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise. \nBOSS TWEED But we're talking about different things, Bill. You describe the present. I see the possibilities. Look to the future. There is so much more. \nThe Butcher starts to look interested. \nCUT TO \n25 INT. TWEED'S OFFICE NIGHT \nLater. The Natives have cleared out; only Tweed and the Butcher remain. The cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been straightened. Bill stands beside the door, while Tweed relaxes in a chair. \nBOSS TWEED There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel. Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected. \nBOSS TWEED (Cont'd) And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the Five Points, I'm prepared to extend you an opportunity. You can work for Tammany... \nBILL THE BUTCHER We work for no one. \nBOSS TWEED ... beside Tammany... in the performance of these civic obligations. And for a satisfactory... I'm prepared even to say equitable... financial participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined the city New York has become. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle work. Might build you up. \nBOSS TWEED We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Then get cops to do it. \nBOSS TWEED Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Appearance means nothing. \nBOSS TWEED Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher. \nBill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and sits down close to him. \nBILL THE BUTCHER If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business. \n26 EXT. STREET NIGHT \nA small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled \"Americus Co./Tammany Hall.\" Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES. As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire, Tweed, in a white coat and fancy fire helmet, steps off the fire wagon to address an ONLOOKER. \nTWEED Anyone inside? \nONLOOKER No, praise God, but all we own... \nTWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits on it. \nONLOOKER Well? \nTWEED Waiting on reinforcements. \nThe SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does not move from the plug. \nTWEED That's not them. It's only the Black Jokes. Seems your fire interrupted their festivities. \nThe wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words \"Black Joke Fire Co.\" written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British Redcoats, still others as Indians. The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief. \nCHIEF May I point out that the building is burning to ashes? \nTWEED Certainly. And may I then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your distance. Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL sounds. Tweed's \"reinforcements\" have arrived: the Native Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug. \nTWEED Alright, boys! To work! \nThe MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends water spluttering everywhere. But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately. \nTWEED Next building over, boys! Mustn't let it spread! \nThe men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that is in no danger at all. A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back. \nKILLORAN Another proud night for Tammany, Bill. \nTWEED Just tell them... (lowers his voice) ... to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open. \nIndeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS Bill The Butcher as he rushes by. \nTWEED Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot out the back. \nBill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches Tweed. \nTEARFUL WOMAN The Black Joke could have saved my house! \nTWEED Black Joke had no business here, Madam. \nTEARFUL WOMAN Their business was to save my house! \nTWEED Tammany's your business. When we're here to call upon there's no need of other. We understand loss, Madam, and take care of our own. \nSHEENY MIKE We can't go back to Corlears Hook, they'll be watching... \nSHANG We'll make for Blackwells. \nJIMMY SPOILS And which way's that through this fog? \nJohnny throws his hands up for quiet. From close by comes the SOUND of COP'S VOICES. They are near. Very near. The boys stay as still as they can... ... and the VOICES recede again in the thick fog. \nJIMMY SPOILS Should have asked them directions as they drifted by, Shang. \nSHANG You'd have liked that, wouldn't you Coal Face? You're the only one they'd miss in the dark. \nSHEENY MIKE Let's quiet, or we'll all be found out! \nAs the BOYS stay still, their boat DRIFTS against an outcropping of land and STOPS. \nSHANG Alright. We lay up here till first light. Then we run back across the river. \nJIMMY SPOILS (contemptuously) River pirates! \nSpoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow. Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for the sun. \nCUT TO \n34 EXT- BLACKWELLS ISLAND DAWN \nShang drowses in the boat, fighting fatigue, then succumbing to it. But h's brought awake suddenly by a loud SPLASH. He looks in the direction of the noise, SEES ... ... the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat in the crook of his arm. \nAMSTERDAM (to everyone) \nPush off! Or his pipe snaps! The other boys are too stunned to resist. They push the boat away from the island. \nAMSTERDAM Head straight out, then turn for the current. \nHe pushes Shang away from him. The two boys stare at each ather, finally remembering... \nSHANG (breathing hard) Figured you for dead. \nAMSTERDAM Close enough. \nSHANG This is my crew. And welcome to join, if you've the mettle. We're river pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers... \nAMSTERDAM (casual disdain) You're lost. \nSHANG Yeah? You've no business saying anything against us! Do you know how much you cost us? You know how much that body's worth? \nAMSTERDAM I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in. \nSHANG Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis. \nAMSTERDAM I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just keep sailing, or we're all done for. \nSHANG (beat; to crew) Go ahead then. (beat; to Amsterdam) He was in his prime. He'd have fetched thirty dollars easy. \nCUT TO \n35 INT. HIDEOUT DAY \nA ramshackle room near the docks. It is part meeting hall, part living quarters for the gang, and part clearing house forstolen goods. SHANG presides over a boisterous meeting. \nJIMMY SPOILS You're as flat as Broadway going north. We can't run the river no more. We're poaching the Natives and the Harbor cops are looking for us. \nSHANG The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about them? \nSHEENY MIKE Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang. But do you have the sand to go against the Natives? \nSHANG It ain't the time to go against the Natives. We've got to build first. Then we go. \nJIMMY SPOILS If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink. \nAmsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him. \nAMSTERDAM Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives? \nJOHNNY I don't know. He acts like it. \nAMSTERDAM If he only acts, held be better on the stage. (looks away) Like her. \nHis tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart. Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang. \nJOHNNY Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points. \nJenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat. \nAMSTERDAM Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider? \nJOHNNY Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses. \nJenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it with a shrewd, appreciative eye. \nSHANG That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk. \nHe puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way. \nSHANG You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam. \nJenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now. \nSHANG Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts more than men, being morts. \nAMSTERDAM Yeah? And why is that? \nJohnny STOPS and Amsterdam continues on by himself. \nCUT TO \n39 INT. MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY \nEchoing. Dank. Amsterdam holds a candle high for light. RATS skitter. He crosses the main floor, enters one of the side tunnels. \nCUT TO \n40 INT. ROOM/OLD BREWERY \nA tiny room we recognize from the first scene: this is the place where Amsterdam lived with his father. He crouches and TEARS UP some floorboards, then quickly LOWERS HIMSELF into the hole. \nCUT TO \n41 INT. UNDER FLOOR/OLD BR.EWERY \nA short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make. Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE. \nAmsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open. Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's father. \nAmsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it. The candle light makes the blade GLEAMS. \nCUT TO \n42 EXT. ALLEY/OLD BREWERY DAY \nA shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels, broken glass and insensible drunks. \nAmsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ... \nShang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES. \nShang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a business deal, and the Second Man walks away. \nAmsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND... doesn't see Amsterdam... and walks off in the opposite direction, across Paradise Square. \nCUT TO \n43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAY \nThe main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political dealings of dubious virtue. \nBill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it. Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna. Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran. \nTWEED I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin. \nPETITIONER #l (GLEASON) My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill humors... \nKILLORAN We can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo. \nTWEED But the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our constituents. Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff... \nGleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcher looks on with amusement. \nTWEED A friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out an arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason's wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of how much the barrel ... \nGLEASON (figuring rapidly) Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars. \nTWEED ...and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution... \nBAFF The same again. At least. \nTWEED At least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at that (Gleason and Baff splutter) But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit a bill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box for further experiment. Hello, Bill. \nKilloran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES. \nTWEED Bolt the door. \nBill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around his head, he keeps his eyes closed. \nTWEED Scotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I know. Scotchy's a good man. \nTWEED Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and use it for his own. (opens his eyes) You got to give him over, Bill. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him than any two others. As do you. \nTWEED Alright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game off to one side. Did you know that? (Bill shrugs) I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in here complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuse Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ... a few practically suggest. (eying Bill significantly) ... our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example. BILL THE BUTCHER (beat) Charles McGloin will do. \nTWEED I'll set the trial for Friday. \nCUT TO \n44 EXT- TOMBS DAY \nCAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head. \nThe CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS, \"HOKEY-POKEY\" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the holiday spirit. \nJenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on. \nFurther back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her. \nJenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd. \nASSISTANT HANGMAN Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward. \n44 CONTINUED: \nCUT TO \n47 EXT. BROADWAY DAY \nAs Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main thoroughfare. \nJENNY Are you a spy, then? \nAMSTERDAM Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say. \nJENNY Appreciator of what? \nAMSTERDAM A good touch. \nShe STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye. \nJENNY Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I do it or not. \nAMSTERDAM Just take a minute, I was Just... \nJENNY I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with anyone's rules but my own. AMSTERDAM What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day, the better his. It don't seem gute right. \nJENNY (a little curious now) What's it to you? \nAMSTERDAM Give him this. \nHe hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the same one she gave Shang. \nAMSTERDAM \nAnd you can keep a little more of what you earned. \nJENNY How'd you come by this? \nAMSTERDAM I got my own touch. \nJENNY Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement? \nAMSTERDAM It's your rules, right? So you decide. \nShe looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her neck like a kerchief. \nCUT TO \n48 INT. HIDEOUT \nA gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches them both. \nShang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck. \nSHANG Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that? \nJENNY From Amsterdam. \nSHANG (beat) It don't suit you. \nCUT TO \n49 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT \nA SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS. Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and whores. \nJACK Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions. \nCITIZEN Nothing but our safety, of course. \nJACK All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there. \nHe gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS. \nThe cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as \"an anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution... a service of Tammany Hall.\" As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.' \nJACK Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe. \nWOMAN CITIZEN (apprehensive) Even against them? \nA small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation, come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for action \nJACK Against them especially. Let me demonstrate. \nJack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off. \nJACK We'll be back for this at our leisure. \nWOMAN CITIZEN You dare leave it here? \nJACK Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine. \nThe Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ... but \nShang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly. \nSHANG You know that's Jack's. \nBOY So what? \nAMSTERDAM It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag. SHANG That watch is a small price for free run of the Points. \nAMSTERDAM If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due. \nSHANG We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts. It's the living day to day. \nJOHNNY He's our Tammany man. \nKilloran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has been keeping his own count. \nKILLORAN ... remarkable... \nAMSTERDAM (With an edge) Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of Johnny Siroccols. \nKILLORAN Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points. \nAMSTERDAM Best but one? Who's better? \nKilloran looks up. Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam, SHAKES his head \"NO\" VIGOROUSLY. Killoran gets the message. \nKILLORAN (smooth) Maybe nobody. But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's come out in front. \nAMSTERDAM I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe. \nKILLORAN Tonight. At the victory celebration. \nCUT TO \n64 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA \nA Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES, HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING, GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR... \nBOSS TWEED (V.O.) Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ... \n... and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription. \n64 CONTINUED: \nWELL-WISHER \"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes.\" \nTWEED A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany. Now, tell 'em what it means, Mayor Wood. \nWOOD \"Fortune favors the bold.\" \nTWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back. \nBOSS TWEED What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City? \nWOOD Well, I could certainly see ... \nKILLORAN (interrupting) We've got a motto. \nBOSS TWEED what is it? (no one knows) Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor, you'll make sure the Latin's right? \nAs Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room... \n... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA... \n... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by \nCHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST... \n... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists. \nEveryone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER. \nAbove the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST... \n... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER. \nBOUNCER I don't know you, you don't enter. \nAMSTERDAM (enjoying himself) Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week. \nJOHNNY (more temperate) Daniel Killoran knows us. \nBOUNCER Oh he does? \nJOHNNY We work for him. \nAMSTERDAM The hell we do. \nJOHNNY (to Amsterdam) Tampen down, will you? \nBOUNCER Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go on! \nHe SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now, and they step forward together toward the Bouncer... \n... until Killoran intervenes. \nKILLORAN (to Bouncer) It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's work for a good wage. \nKilloran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes firmly. \nKILLORAN A fine first showing. But second best. \nAMSTERDAM Second, eh? You don't say so. \nKILLORAN It's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always sweep the field. \nAMSTERDAM What? \nKILLORAN We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday. \nAMSTERDAM (to Johnny, glaring) Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours? \nJOHNNY No, I didn't have no idea ... \nPAGODA SPECTATOR Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum. \nThe Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED. Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment. \nThe Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver. \nBill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air... \n... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTER and HARDER with every toss. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (in full control) What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet. \nThe Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH... \n... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and every time he catches it by its handle ... \n... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standing very close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ... \n... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past the second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until it SLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent... \n... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND. \nThe Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out until ... just as smoothly, just as confidently... \n... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat. One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand. \nBill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer. \nBILL THE BUTCHER There's for your beauty and your song. \nThe Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the Butcher's implements. \nNow two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand. \nThe Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament. \nBill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others. \nAMSTERDAM Mr. Poole! \nBill turns, searching out the voice ... \nAMSTERDAM Bill Poole! \nAnd SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm, smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic. \nAMSTERDAM My compliments on your exhibition, sir. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Thank you, sir. \nAMSTERDAM It was like watching a dance. (Bill nods his thanks) Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely) You know me, sir. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Do I? Are you missing a finger? \nAppreciative laughter from the crowd. \nAMSTERDAM No. A father. \nThe laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger man. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Do you have a name? \nAMSTERDAM Amsterdam. \nBILL THE BUTCHER That's a New York name. (suddenly smiles) shall we drink to it? \nAMSTERDAM Indeed. (they drink) And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that? \nBILL THE BUTCHER Priest Vallon's son? (Amsterdam nods) Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man. \nAMSTERDAM Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth what they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you. \nDEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their fan-tan ignore this confrontation. \nBILL THE BUTCHER What do you want, boyo? \nAMSTERDAM I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father. \nAmsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch. \nAnd Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand like lightning. \nAnd just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD... \n... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING. \nAmsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the Butcher... \n... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each other... \n... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam. \nAnd neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time ... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers. \nAnd, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to the main floor. \nThe Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN. \nIn the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike. \nJENNY Go easy! Go easy. It's over. \nJOHNNY He knew what he was doing, hitting you. \nJENNY Let's get him up. \nShe grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet. \nJENNY (Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face) Therels too damn little of him left to know anything. \nThey start across Paradise Square, holding him up... \n... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points... \n... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door. \nDISSOLVE TO \n66 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY \nAnother DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating. \nDon Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says .... \nDON WHISKERANDOS Someone's here for you. \nMONK EASTMAN That so? What's he look like? \nDON WHISKERANDOS He looks pretty damned sorry. \nMONK EASTMAN (looks at Amsterdam) Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave? \nAMSTERDAM No thanks. \nMONK EASTMAN Face is too sore, eh? I understand. \nAMSTERDAM No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden. \nMONK EASTMAN We're all even, son. There's nothing more between us. \nAMSTERDAM I'd like it if there was. \nMONK EASTMAN Are you proposing employment? \nAMSTERDAM A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can learn from you. \nMONK EASTMAN Boyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learn nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either. \nAMSTERDAM The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign over the Points. \nMONK EASTMAN And Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say? \nAMSTERDAM Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak. \nMONK EASTMAN Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about what they got in their hands. (beat) Listen, son... take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger spoils an edge. \nAMSTERDAM Then you say no? \nMonk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like NOTCHES- \nMONK EASTMAN You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on your own. \nAMSTERDAM Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then. \nMONK EASTMAN Fair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing. Although I do hold money preferable to all. (Amsterdam turns to leave) \nBut I'm sure we'll have news of each other. \nAMSTERDAM Bound to. \nAs he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don Whiskerandos for another hot towel. \nCUT TO \n67 EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nA large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon. \nBOSS TWEED (to the people as they grab the coal) Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people... \nAs he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You sent me word. \nBOSS TWEED We could use help here. Grab a sack. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I keep my hands clean. \nBOSS TWEED (now he looks at him) So I've observed. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (tense) Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me at the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out. \nBOSS TWEED What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had? Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails. \nBILL THE BUTCHER It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind. \nBOSS TWEED Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman. (Bill's incredulous) I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US. \nBILL THE BUTCHER What? \nBOSS TWEED Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you. But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us all. \nNow ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess. \nNow it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's tense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head. \nJenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he walks back to the GANG. \nNow Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny. \nJenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her head. Yes. Him. \nA small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,\" arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other COUPLES join them. \nAMSTERDAM So you accept? \nJENNY What? \nAMSTERDAM You accept to be my mort and no one else's. \nJENNY (teasing) No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you. \nAMSTERDAM (going along with the joke) It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around. \nJENNY Maybe you'll look better later. \nThe Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the floor. \nAMSTERDAM I will if we're together later. (she smiles) And what about after that? After tonight? \nJENNY I chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go with someone else. \nShe takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS on Amsterdam's face. \nAMSTERDAM I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're ready. No more. \nHis eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny NODS and they DANCE AWAY ... \n... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet. \nCUT TO \n70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT \nIn the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door. \nJOHNNY (whispering) Amsterdam. (louder; hissing) Amsterdam! \nAMSTERDAM (V.O.) Who is it? \nJOHNNY Me. \nAMSTERDAM Come on in. \nJOHNNY I don't want to come in! You come out. \nAMSTERDAM Just a damn minute. \nAMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep on the floor inside. \nAMSTERDAM What do you want? \nCUT TO \n71 EXT. PIER/DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT \nJust before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM follows JOHNNY out of the house. \nJOHNNY I'm going to fight you. \nAMSTERDAM Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else? \nJOHNNY Now. \nAMSTERDAM You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny? (Johnny turns, determined) Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this? \nJOHNNY So when I lose no one will see. \nAnd he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking him down. \nThe two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such extravagant energy that they soon... \n... ROLL OFF the pier... \nCUT TO \n72 EXT. PIER DAWN \n... onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting .... \n... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow. \nAmsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even. \nThe Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity. \nAmsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment. \nAMSTERDAM Satisfied? \nJOHNNY Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night. \nAnd he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down beside him. \nBOSS TWEED I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other. Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart. \nKilloran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly, discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS across the restaurant floor... \n... past the Band and the Dancing Giris ... \n... to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING DOOR, his face has lost its humor. \nCUT TO \n75 INT. KITCHEN/RESTAURANT/PARK ROW \nA madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume. \nAs Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as it's carried out the door. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. (takes a big bite) It's good, what is it? \nBOSS TWEED Pheasant. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing like this. \nBOSS TWEED You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with him, and you come back with his blood on your hands. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (chewing his food) He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no one. \nBOSS TWEED You stand for anything if I tell you. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when you talk. \nAs they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of WAITERS. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you ain't earned it. \nBOSS TWEED What did you earn us, killing Monk? \nBILL THE BUTCHER Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior. \nBOSS TWEED I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book, \"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.\" I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire. \nBOSS TWEED (measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else. But Bill, I'm only saying... I'm counselinm... look in the distance. You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners. \nBill grabs another piece of food from a tray. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Howls these manners? \nBOSS TWEED Fine, if you're hungry. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'm always hungry. \nBOSS TWEED I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us together than separate. We'll dine together sometime. \nBill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage. \nCUT TO \n76 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW \nLater. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he PICKS from them. \nBOSS TWEED Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is there to take his place? (as Killoran starts to answer) Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be killed, but he must be checked. \nKILLARAN It could be a police matter. \nBOSS TWEED Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must come from within the Points, not without. \nKILLORAN The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has sand. \nBOSS TWEED That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking like a fine filet. Who else is there? \nKILLORAN Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither. \nBOSS TWEED What would that be? \nKILLORAN The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn revenge for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward. He'll have the skill and power soon enough. \nBOSS TWEED Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like. \nKILLORAN And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues? \nBOSS TWEED I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use. They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied. \nKILLORAN Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied. \nBOSS TWEED I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ... well, damn it all, Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of that, eh? \nBoss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights, filling the room with deep shadows. \nKILLORAN It'd be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even edifying. \nBOSS TWEED But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that. (as he walks away) I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that food for the canaries. \nCUT TO \n77 EXT. STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE DAY \nThe sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street, nicknamed \"The Bloody Angle.\" SOUND of a horse and cart as we see a row of UPTURNED mostly WOMEN and YOUNG CHILDREN. \nA NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down. \nHe sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins. \n79 CONTINUED: \nJOHNNY Did your mother have the same color? \nI don't know. \nJOHNNY (as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders) Lie back, I want to look at you. (his eyes glide along her body) What's that mark? \nEMMA LOSS I always had it. \nJOHNNY (touching her lightly) And there? Is that a scar? \nEMMA LOSS (she looks at her naked belly) There was a baby. They cut it out. \nJOHNNY And that on your shoulder? That looks old. \nEMMA LOSS Yeah, I got that when I ... \nJOHNNY (interrupting, quiet) I don't want to know when. Don't tell me about before or what you used to be, I don't want that. \nEMMA LOSS What about your scars. Do you have scars? \nJOHNNY None I ever seen. Maybe you can find them. \nHer hands and mouth cover his body. He closes his eyes. \nCUT TO \n80 INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCEIS \nAnother room. Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny walks in. \nAMSTERDAM Go on. I can see you later. Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny. \nJENNY What are you doing? \nAMSTERDAM I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of business. You understand business. \nJENNY Sure I do. But there's something else I still don't understand. At Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me? \nAMSTERDAM Yeah. I did. \nShe HITS him. In the face. Hard. Not a slap. A solid PUNCH. His nose starts to gush blood. He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow, keeping his eyes an her. \nJENNY Meantime's over. \nAMSTERDAM Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much blood. \nJenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his nose. \nJENNY Put your head back. \nAMSTERDAM That don't work. \nJENNY Put your head back I said. \nAMSTERDAM (as she tends to him) So why so sudden, then? \nJENNY Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain I can't decide. Now I decide, you say it's sudden. \nAMSTERDAM It's the whore did it, then. \nJENNY Don't flatter yourself. \nAMSTERDAM It's because you're jealous. \nJENNY It's because you didn't lie about hitting me. \nAMSTERDAM Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then. \nHe reaches to pull her down on the bed. \nJENNY Not here. There's too much past. \nCUT TO \n81 INT. ROOM/DEAD RABBIT HOUSE \nThe room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight. Amsterdam and Jenny have just made love. \nJENNY It must be morning. \nAMSTERDAM I don't care, I'm not getting up. \nJENNY This is what you meant, then? It's going to be just the same from now on? \nAMSTERDAM What? \nJENNY Every morning I wake up next to you. \nAMSTERDAM Or you don't wake up at all. \nJENNY We only just started in and you're already threatening me. \nAMSTERDAM It's not a threat. (no teasing now) It's a declaration of love. \nJENNY I prefer my kind. This kind. \nShe reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine DIAMOND RING, which she slips on his finger. Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of course) suspicion. \nJOHNNY It's not just citizens in there? \nGENT 1 Of course it is. \nJOHNNY with arms? \nGENT 2 From their damned gang. Some of them live there. \nAMSTERDAM Some of who? \nGENT 2 \nThe Native Americans. \nJOHNNY We didn't contract for that. \nGENT 1 We'll pay extra for the danger. \nAMSTERDAM No danger. But you will pay extra. (turns; to gang) Let's go and greet some Natives. \nUnder SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS, the GANG STORMS the building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were attacking a medieval fortress. ARMS reach out from windows to try and pull them off. The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS. As they charge inside, the CAMERA RISES to an OVERHEAD shot and we ... \nDISSOLVE TO \n86 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nLater. The same OVERHEAD ANGLE. BODIES litter the street everywhere. Some dead and wounded Rabbits lie near NATIVES who have gone to their reward. Some BUILDING RESIDENTS wander the street in a daze. JOHNNY is collecting money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches with Jenny. He's carrying a rifle he took from the building. \nAMSTERDAM (to Gents) Alright, then? \nGENT 2 Very much alright. Quite a spectacle. \nAMSTERDAM Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a moment, gents. (he turns to Jenny) You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree, did you not. \nJENNY I did, yes. \nAMSTERDAM Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure what you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're saying... \nGENT 2 (interrupting) Excuse me, we have to finish and... \nAMSTERDAM (to Gent 2) Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment. (back to Jenny) Where do you settle? \nJENNY Amsterdam, what are you saying? \nAMSTERDAM I'm asking, where does anyone settle? \nJENNY I don't know, you mean a place, a home? \nAMSTERDAM A home yes. \nGENT 1 Excuse me, but we really must conclude. \nAMSTERDAM (ignoring him) Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home. \nNo one sees it coming. Amsterdam FLASHES around, swinging the BUTT of his rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him breathless to the ground. Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt into Gent 2's face, knocking him cold. \nAMSTERDAM Fine place. Room enough for all. (to Johnny) Get them out of here. \nGENT 2 They'll come back looking for you. \nAMSTERDAM With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing bastards even for ned. (to Jenny) Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ... \nJENNY (interrupting) I know this building. \nCUT TO \n87 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER \nAs Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals, of the two- and four-legged variety. \nJENNY These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle. \nAmsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to see... \n... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo. \nStooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name \"Maggie Everdeane.\" \nJENNY We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought her back here. Dug this myself. (beat) Families. Give here what I gave you. \nAmsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's grave. \nJENNY She'll keep an eye on this for us. How about some help? \nHe KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones. \nAMSTERDAM You trusting me with your treasure, then? \nJENNY Just take another look at it to remind you. I can always do fine on my own. \nAmsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him. \nJENNY What's mine is yours, is that it? \nAMSTERDAM I could use this, too. \nFrom the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS. \nJENNY You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh? \nAmsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to dig again. \nCUT TO \n96 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nSTART CLOSE ON: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the election returns. And, below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of TAMMANY BOYOS, looking up at the wire. \nBOYO 1 I ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on. \nJOHNNY This election'll be over unless we get up there. \nKILLORAN \"We?\" This was your notion, you go up there. \nBOYO 2 (looking at polling place) Him. He looks likely, and he ain't workin'. \nHe points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the polls. \nJOHNNY (calls to him) Sheeny Mike, you want to make ... (to Boyo 1) ...how much? \nBOYO 1 A dollar. \nJOHNNY (to Sheeny Mike) Five dollars? Just to help us? \nSHEENY MIKE (a bit wary) What's the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany. \nBOYO 2 Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ... \nJOHNNY (interrupting) He knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell him youlre helping, if that's the way you want it. And you can keep the full five. Just start climbing. \nSHEENY MIKE (beat) Where's the ned? \nBoyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him a large pair of SHEARS. Mike wipes his palms on his pants and STARTS UP the pole. \nFor Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They watch Mike's ascent with pleasure. \nSheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole. He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below. A couple of SPECTATORS have stopped to watch as well. \nMike gets to the top of the pole, REACHES OUT--STRETCHES OUT-toward the telegraph wire with the shears... \n... strains... reaches ... MAKES THE CUT. \nOn the ground, Johnny looks relieved. The Boyos offer a partmocking round of applause. \nIn the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike TURNS to acknowledge the applause. Just briefly. But long enough so he's distracted. He sees the upturned FACES fill suddenly with fear, and he TURNS when he HEA.RS a sharp, odd WHISTLING NOISE. \nA LIVE TELEGRAPH WIRE is coming at him. He doesn't even have time to scream. The wire hits him, whipping around him as JOLTS OF NT leap through his body and he FALLS to the ground. \nCUT TO \n97 EXT. PARADISE SQUA.RE DAY \nHANDS pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it off... past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching... and Johnny, who is on the other. \nJOHNNY He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him. \nAMSTERDAM He wasn't Tammany. Not like you. \nJOHNNY He made the right choice. \nAMSTERDAM You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your family! \nJOHNNY (slowly) I didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's my own and what isn't. You're not my family. And I swear, I swear on the Virgin Mother's eyes ... I know what I'm doing, Amsterdam. It's you that's always been blind. (they look at each other) I'll say my farewells. \nJohnny KNEELS down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow. \nJOHNNY You still smell like drink. \nHe nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he RISES a half-dozen NEWSBOYS DASH into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and crying... \nNEWSBOYS New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany ticket prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows Armageddon for crime! \nJOHNNY (looking at Amsterdam and Jenny) Can't you hear the future? \nHe walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys. \nCUT TO \n98 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA \nThe place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives. They sit at a round poker table with a green felt top. \nJIMMY SPOILS We say the Square is the place. Let Barnum sell the tickets for a share of the price... \nNATIVE SECOND (interrupting) A small share. \nJIMMY SPOILS And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal. \nNATIVE SECOND Who works the crowd? \nAMSTERDAM Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'll cut their hands off. After the fight. \nNATIVE SECOND We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other fighting. I know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black Birds, and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters. \nAs these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far side of the room. \nBARTENDER Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet. \nMOTHER JOYCE My ned's on the boy. He's got the youth, and he's got the hunger. \nBARTENDER Is he so hungry you'll put up a hundred? \nLITTLE GIRL Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming. \nCUT TO \n103 EXT. STREET/FIVE POINTS NIGHT \nAs Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS. \nBOY My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for you? \nJenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to pick it up as Rioters rush by her. \nCUT TO \n104 EXT. PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT \nMATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The piers are BURNING. The docks are ash. \nSAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it \n... but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny--20 maybe, Jennyls age when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like two jungle beasts over a kill. \nJENNY I'd kill you for this. \nThe Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava. \nJenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on her ... working the oars clumsily, furiously ... moving the boat across the water, trying to get away from the city... \n... and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRON--like the side of a glacier... bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny turns, SEES it. It is ... \n... the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE). It LOBS cannon fire into the city, setting off tremendous explosions. Jenny TURNS back for the shore... \n... as cannonballs land, devastating rioters. \nCUT TO \n105 EXT. SHORE/RIVER NIGHT \nMATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst... \n... injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally, RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is theirs; cops and militia are in retreat. \nJenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland. \nCUT TO \n106 EXT. DOYERS STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT \nFurther from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle. And STOPS. \nWeird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT. The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering. \nAt the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and starts to BACK out of the alley. \nThe Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises, burning, to the top of the lamppost ... \n... where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night. From these mad SHADOWS, we... \nDISSOLVE TO \n107 EXT. ROOF/JACOB-S LADDER NIGHT \n... the face of Amsterdam, stepping out of the SHADOWS of the roof. There are flames in the distance. The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he speaks. \nAMSTERDAM No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of this. \nJIMMY SPOILS I want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle. I want to address who done it. \nAMSTERDAM Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay with us. You'll have a little of your own back. \nJIMMY SPOILS How's that? \nAMSTERDAM These riots are a gift. They... \n... he PAUSES just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the outside ladder leading to the roof: it's Jenny, returning. \nAMSTERDAM ... they've made everything clear, as you might say. (to Jenny) Are you with us, then? \nJENNY Until I can get out. I'll go with you... (straight at Amsterdam) ...meantime. \nAMSTERDAM Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street. \nJIMMY SPOILS The Armory! We'll have to beat the militia to get there. \nAMSTERDAM There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and militia? \nJENNY I can show you from here where they are. I doubt they'll get to the Armory in force before midday tomorrow. \nAMSTERDAM We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody. Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery. \nJIMMY SPOILS Why, we going to take a sail to Europe? \nAMSTERDAM No. But we could, after this. We're going... (slowly, savoring this) ...we're going to take the banks. The government banks. (awed silence from all) Are we not? \nJENNY (beat; steps forward) Seems we are. \nOne by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But they stand with Amsterdam. \nCUT TO \n108 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT \nJOHNNY (interrupting) Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed ain't going to wait around for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a chance. \nAMSTERDAM Chance of what? \nJOHNNY A chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the Armory too. \nAMSTERDAM And what's any of it mean to you? \nJOHNNY It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still part of me here. I don't want to see you lose everything in your life at once. \nAMSTERDAM I'm going to lose nothing. (beat) If you believe me, you can stay. \nJOHNNY I got to go. \nHe turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES- \nJENNY So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the same side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you? \nFrom Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we... \nDISSOLVE TO \n111 INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT \n... Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ... \n... the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame. \nAnd Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Murder Me? No one's going to murder me. \nAMSTERDAM Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because that's the only way you'll ever see it coming. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got no reason to care about any danger to me. \nAMSTERDAM One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, not Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you, Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell. \nAMSTERDAM Fine, so long as I pass you on my way. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you. \nAMSTERDAM Someone I credit. \nBILL THE BUTCHER That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I am Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough. \nAMSTERDAM You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be mine. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and opening you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how I'm going to enjoy doing it. \nAMSTERDAM Why don't I make it easy for you, then. \nHe TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the entire gang of Natives. \nAMSTERDAM Same as you're making it easy for Tweed. \nHe keeps walking... through the Natives ... dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Amsterdam! (Amsterdam looks around) Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy. \nAmsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walking through the enemy camp as we... \nDISSOLVE TO \n112 INT. JACOB'S LADDER \n....Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. All the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others. \nAs the group passes, others STAND and walk with them... \n... until the whole gang is rallied... \n... and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building. \nDISSOLVE TO \n113 INT. BASEMENT \nAs Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo like repeated rifle shots. \nDISSOLVE TO \n114 INT. TUNNEL \nThe whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons. \nFrightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appear in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts. \nAs the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father. Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day too. \nDISSOLVE TO \n115 INT. TUNNEL \nThe last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS it down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out. \nCUT TO \n116 EXT. CANAL STREET DAWN \n... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street. \n120 CONTINUED: \nFIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander. \nBILL THE BUTCHER We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break! \nMILITIA COMMANDER I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out! \nBILL THE BUTCHER Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move! (turns to his men) Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us! \nBill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to FOLLOW. \nBILL THE BUTCHER We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on! \nThe men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever. \nBill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him. \nHe has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND shakes ... he fires... too soon! ... \n... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill. \nThe Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ... \n... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above him now, looking down at him. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this? \nJOHNNY Tweed. \nBill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You'd lie to save your friend. \nJOHNNY (in terrible pain) No. There's no friends for me. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Me the same. Pity us both. \nHe EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (to his men) Hold your fire! (toward the Armory) In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam! \nThe Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward, gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him. \nAmsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory. \nAMSTERDAM Go on, then, talk. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You and me. \nAMSTERDAM (beat) Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body. \nBill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour... \n... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves. \nAnd Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory. \nCUT TO \n121 INT. ARMORY DAY \nAs the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island. \nBill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at his feet. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Your friend made different friends lately. \nAMSTERDAM Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive? \nBILL THE BUTCHER It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door. \nAMSTERDAM I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You'd lay aside what's between us? \nAMSTERDAM I'm not forgetting where I put it. \nBILL THE BUTCHER If you do, I'll remind you. (he turns, leaves) \nAMSTERDAM What's your call, Bill? \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'm considering where's my better chance. \nHe walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS it himself and strides out into the street. \nCUT TO \n122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY \nBill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines. \nFrom inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him. \nThe sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives. \nAmsterdam WATCHES intently. \nThe Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound... \n", "test1_input": "Gangs of New York \nGangs of New York by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan. 3rd Draft (1993). More info about this movie on imdb.com INT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY \nHalf in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not flinch. The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we hear. VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket. \nVALLON No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son. \nHe hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son. Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn. \nCUT TO \n2 INT. HALLWAY \nVALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him. They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path. \nCUT TO \n3 INT. ROOM \nAnother room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall. A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit. Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves. \nCUT TO \n4 INT. HALLWAY \nJack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross. \nHAPPY JACK Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest? \nVALLON No, Jack. For a baptism. \nNow a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS. MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous. Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig. \nRABBIT WARRIOR We'll send a few across the river today, Priest. \nHe joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink. The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow. \nCUT TO \n5 INT. ROOM \nVast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on... ... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead. Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up. He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat. Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries. Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after them. The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog. \nSHANG What's the fight? \nAMSTERDAM The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll all be settled today. \nSHANG Are you Native or Rabbit? \nAMSTERDAM (points to rabbit on pike) What do you think? \nSHANG Looks alright. I'll stand by you, then. \nCUT TO \n6 INT. HALLWAY \nThe group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel. In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN (MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door. \nVALLON \nI don't know you. \nMAN (lightly) I suppose there's to be a fight. \nVALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice. \nVALLON Derry? \nMAN Donnegal. Name's Monk Eastman. \nVALLON And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman? \nMONK lf there's money in it. \nVALLON Fight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest. \nMONK Well, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how I'm not quite a Native American myself. \nVALLON Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later. \nMONK Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me double. Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man, in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes his head look even bigger. \nVALLON (as the door splinters settle) Stand with us then. \nCUT TO \n7 EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER) \nWINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet. VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints Brewery. It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage. WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero. The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or never came at all. VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal. Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles. Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather. \nVALLON Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled? A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young, lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved, instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE. \nOn the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight. They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team. \nBILL THE BUTCHER On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who holds sway. \nVALLON Bene. \nBILL THE BUTCHER By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds. \n", "test1_true": "BILL THE BUTCHER Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns wounded has been touched by God. \nVALLON It wasn't God who touched your eye. \nBILL THE BUTCHER It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from his death. \nVALLON I don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it. \nBILL THE BUTCHER There is another matter. \nVALLON Say it out and quick, before spring gets here. \nBILL THE BUTCHER No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the halt and maimed. \nVALLON So? \nBILL THE BUTCHER So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits can smile out of both sides of his face. \nA pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE BUTCHER's feet. In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass. The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled. \nVALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose, underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down, like the blades of a jackknife. \nVALLON Prepare to receive the Lord. \nAnd the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into BATTLE. VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again. Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder. \nThen a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling. Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them. BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm. The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with CHEERS. \nVALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once. \nMonk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone. The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new star in the making. \nThe Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs. \nA NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary, delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach. \nA NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range against several Rabbits. \nA RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to GOUGE his face. \nThe NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's face. \nAmsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks around in growing PANIC for his father. \nSHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING him... ... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat. \nSHANG (desperate) I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of five generations! \nPEG-LEG Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian. \nHe pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving the BOY quaking. The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise Square. The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops. \nThe POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the wagons. \nThere are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of the wind and the GROANS of the wounded. Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time. The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain behind, dead on the ground. The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront each other once again. Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity. Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him. VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible fury. Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. He hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street, which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb and driven it through his heart. Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the knees. The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is hysterical. \nVALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon to help... ... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between the Butcher and his father... As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting, falling back... looking for his chance... ... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off balance... \n...just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father FALLING, tries to turn but... \n... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get away... ... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his enemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering, VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's a terrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away. Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam by the arm, making him drop his hatchet. \nBILL THE BUTCHER You need a weapon? Use a knife. He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the Butcher sunk into his father's chest. \nBILL THE BUTCHER It makes a deeper cut. And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's heart. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Say a benediction, Priest. \nVALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (to Amsterdam) Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against the Native Americans. Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (announcing) Ears and noses will be trophies of the day. \nThe Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the Natives have clearly carried the day. The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him. Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his throat. \nVALLON Can't..can't cross the river... with steel through my heart. Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly something he is meant to do himself. Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon tries not to cry out. The knife does not move. Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony. Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain. Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart. He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam. \nMONK That's yours, rightfully. Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat, REMOVING some money. \nMONK And this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral. \nAMSTERDAM No! He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior intervenes. \nHAPPY JACK It's fair. \nAmsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks, then on his left eye. The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him: a last moment of recognition. VALLON Hon ... AMSTERDAM No, Pa! \nVALLON ... honor me... think of me ... don't never look away. Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him. \nRABBIT WOMAN Take the body. Bring the boy. Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at them, like an animal. \nRABBIT WARRIOR Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now. \nAMSTERDAM Get away! Get away! \nHAPPY JACK Leave him be. He's his to mourn. \nAnd the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down the narrow streets. Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies. Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping solitary vigil over his father. \nA TITLE is superimposed across this scene: \n", "test1_id": 969, "test2_input": "AMSTERDAM This mob ever have a proper name? \nJOHNNY We was called after Shang when we was named at all. \nAMSTERDAM We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history. They were legend, and we'll live up to them. \nCUT TO \n55 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT \nAmsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river. There's a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck. \nIt's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat, and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's she's looking at him. \nShe uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him. \nAMSTERDAM What's this then? \nJENNY Payment for the silk. \nThen DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to make love. \nCUT TO \n56 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT \nLater. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her warm in the chill air. \nJENNY You were waiting for me out here, weren't you? \nAMSTERDAM Maybe I was, yeah. \nJENNY You was that sure of me? \nAMSTERDAM Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing. \nJENNY It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy. \nAMSTERDAM Alright. \nHe sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave. \nJENNY I'll say when I want to, not you. \nAMSTERDAM Stay then. (beat; smile) One way or another, I get what I want. \nJENNY (looking at him) Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted. \nAMSTERDAM You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me what I'm wanting. \nJENNY You got blood in your eye for someone. \nAMSTERDAM It's just I can't look away, that's all. \nJENNY Who from? \nAMSTERDAM Bill Poole. \nJENNY You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him. \nAMSTERDAM 'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece. \nJENNY You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager Bill the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does. \nAMSTERDAM He'll know about me soon enough. \nJENNY And after the Butcher? \nAMSTERDAM You. \nJENNY Is that so? \nAMSTERDAM You'll be in love with me. \nJENNY Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So why look for more than that. \nAMSTERDAM That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one else for either. \nJENNY Why? \nAMSTERDAM 'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other. \nJENNY I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be good in that? \nHe stares at her. \nAMSTERDAM We'll see. \nJenny pulls the coat tighter around her. \nJENNY It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do. \nAMSTERDAM And what about the meantime? \nJENNY Meantime's business. \nCUT TO \n57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nA CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker, a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the political spiel. \n", "test2_true": "Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes, Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square. \nSHEENY MIKE Any Irish hears that will be out for blood. \nAMSTERDAM The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could. \nSHEENY MIKE We'd do the same. \nAMSTERDkM Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference. \nJOHNNY Tammany earns better. That's the difference. \nAMSTERDAM I ain't seen their ned yet. \nJohnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain the day's deal. \nJOHNNY You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal. \nSHEENY MIKE It's sound, Amsterdam. \nAMSTERDAM Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get it. \nJOHNNY It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work. We work for Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure. \nJIMMY SPOILS So we're politicians just for today. \nAMSTERDAM Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves. \nCUT TO \n58 MONTAGE \nThe Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters. They pick up DRUNKS in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit MORTS raust PATRONS in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai SAILORS from saloons; corral CITIZENS as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to get them to vote. It's the strong arm of democracy. \nCUT TO \n59 EXT. POLLING PLACE DAY \nOn one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a RABBLE of potential voters; on the other, POLICE doing their best. Behind and all around, various WARD HEELERS and SMALL-TIME POLITICIANS, representing both the Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood. Varicus factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their VOTERS into the polls. \nJIMMY SPOILS He's got the right to vote, damn you! COP Not four times he don't. (shoves a Voter) There'll be no damned repeaters here! \nThe Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted VOTER, while other gang members rush to GRAB VOTERS leaving the polls. \nPANDEMONIUM. \nCUT TO \n60 INT. TAMMANY HALL DAY \nThe main floor is jammed with CLUBMEN and PARTY RACKS. Daniel Killoran bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by JOURNALISTS. \nBOSS TWEED I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every horse thief is a Know-Nothing. \nGood-natured LAUGHING all around. Even TWEED seems amused. Killoran catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him. \nKILLORAN The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at the polls yet. \nBOSS TWEED Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we need, Daniel. I want a triumph. \nCUT TO \n61 INT. DON WHISKERANDOSO BARBER SHOP DAY \nAmsterdam roughly deposits REPEAT VOTERS in the barber chairs, as the BARBERS work FRANTICALLY to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise alter appearances. As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him with bay rum and pushes another REPEATER down in his place. Johnny keeps count of the turnover. \nDON WHISKERANDOS (BARBER) \nNow that's eight... and how many still to come ... \nHe looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their turn under close supervision. \nREPEATER I already voted once today. Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood. \nAMSTERDAM Once? Come here and do your duty. \nAmsterdam GRABS him and SLAMS him down in a chair. \nCUT TO \n62 INT. FAN-TAN PARLOR DAY \nAmsterdam and some RABBITS BURST into the front door, frightening and scattering all the Chinese GAMBLERS. \nAMSTERDAM (barking orders) Line up like soldiers! \nSHEENY MIKE They got no notion what you're talking about. \nAMSTERDAM (To Johnny) You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand. \nAmsterdam GRABS the nearest two CHINESE by their PIGTAILS and HURLS them against the wall. \nCUT TO \n63 INT. OPIUM DEN \nAmsterdam and the Rabbits PROWL the murky darkness where OPIUM EATERS lie in bunks stacked high against the walls. The Rabbits start ROUSING and rounding up the Opium Eaters. Jimmy Spoils SLINGS a couple over his shoulder like flour sacks. Amsterdam SHOVES two more out the door, past an admiring Daniel Killoran. \nKILLORAN (to Johnny) I come to see if our counts square. You boys have made a remarkable showing.... \nAMSTERDAM Who the hell's this? \n", "test2_id": 970, "test3_input": "... the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, a half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his fierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated headline over his picture: \"Fresh Scourge of the Five Points.\" The date reads \"June, 1863.11 \nAMSTERDA.M (V.O.) And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended. \nFrom this illustration, we quickly... \nDISSOLVE TO \n92 EXT. RIVER DAY \n... Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to \nhis feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring. \nAMSTERDAM Now! Finish him now! \nFar up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators. \nJOHNNY Our man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry? \nFIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears carrying a sign announcing \"Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter 2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD off his knuckles. \nA GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum . \nBARNUM I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ... (indicates one side of the ring) ... and the Native Americans. \nHe FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives. Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition. \nBARNUM Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition. With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wonders that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway... \nThere are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism. \nBARNUM ... P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural, from nature and from myth! (continued boos) And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents.. (indicated fighters) ... fists up! \nThe Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging. A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck, the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place again. \nJOHNNY Dobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives has never lost before. \nAMSTERDAM Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before. \nJOHNNY That'll shame them thorough. \nAMSTERDAM There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range. \nIt's time to squeeze the trigger, John. \nThe next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other furiously. \nJOHNNY Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammany pushing back. \nAMSTERDAM That don't matter any more. \nJOHNNY It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heart and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're going to have to throw in with Tammany some way. \nThe action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2. \nJOHNNY They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been! \nIn the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time KNOCKS HIM COLD. \nAMSTERDAM (indicates Fighter 1) You call that strong, John? \nIn the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam WAVES them back. \nAMSTERDAM (to Johnny) This is our time now! \nBARNUM (trying to make official announcement) The winner... gentlemen, please! ... the winner in the 39th round is the Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ... please, gentlemen! \nThe unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdam iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but the champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum. \nBARNUM Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdam promises ... (Amsterdam whispers to him briefly) \n... something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest these are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong ever done in the Five Points. \nThe crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. Only Johnny seems glum, concerned. \nThis is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death... \nAMSTERDAM (interrupting, emphasizing) To the death. If he can stand up to it. \nBARNUM ... on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The names of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ... and Mr. William Poole, known to all as ... \nBILL THE BUTCHER (leaping up) They know me by any name, you son of a bitch! \nThe crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down and cool him off. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (yelling) I'll have him stretched on a spit! \nKilloran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakes his head vehemently. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (to Killoran) You got no more to say about this now. \n92 CONTINUED: \nAMSTERDAM Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your terms. \nKILLORAN (to Bill) Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my attention. (yelling to Amsterdam) Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done. \nHe walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam. \n", "test3_true": "AMSTERDAM I remember it better from another time. \nHe takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on. \nCUT TO \n93 INT./EXT. DRAFT REGISTRATION OFFICE \nSTART CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher- \nBut we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second, very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN. \nCLERK Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act. Keep it somewhere safe. \nPROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN I'll keep it with me. \nThere is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man, and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous Young Man heads for the door... \n... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves. \nDRAFTEE 1 Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too. \nDRAFTEE 2 Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg. \nThe Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves. \nPROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but... \nBOSS TWEED No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300 exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced. \nThe Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran. \nKILLORAN You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to hurt us in elections. \nBOSS TWEED It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them. (to Draftees) Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of crisis! \nDRAFTEE 4 We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what! \nBOSS TWEED Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how... \nDRAFTEE 5 Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you fight! \nDRAFTEE 6 That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see! \nBOSS TWEED (as he backs off) Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding. (to Killoran) Holy Mother. \nTweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees snakes down the block and into Paradise Square. \nBOSS TWEED Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you think Amsterdam will do our work for us first. \nKILLORAN He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern \nBOSS TWEED Not so daunting as this. (turns to the Draftees in the street) Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great struggle... \nThere is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside. \nOUTSIDE DRAFTEE Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind! \nBOSS TWEED Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days? \nCUT TO \n94 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nElection Day pandemonium. The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans--identifiable because of their long dusters--strongarm REPEATERS into the polls. \nHis attention is drawn to a HARRIED TELEGRAPH OPERATOR, who is being SHOUTED at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering volumes of the voting registry. It's chaos. The poor Operator can't cope. \nCUT TO \n95 INT. TAMMANY HALL \nIt's chaos here, too. The large main room is filled with TELEGRAPH OPERATORS receiving election returns. There is SHOUTING and CONCERN throughout the room. Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry. \nBOSS TWEED I swear that science will be the death of industry. \nKILLORKN The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get the repeaters in and out. \nBOSS TWEED (losing patience) Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain. (Killoran looks at him blankly) Do something! \nJOHNNY If you'll allow me. \nThey both TURN to see Johnny standing coolly before them. \nJOHNNY There's a scheme we might try. \nKILLORAN You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come in. \nBOSS TWEED A moment please, Daniel. One moment. (to Johnny) You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam? (Johnny nods) And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here? \nJOHNNY Opportunity. Science and opportunity. \nKILLORAN You got opportunities enough among your own. \nJOHNNY I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And I like to stay with the advantage. \nBOSS TWEED Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps you're even saying... that your friend and your gang may be ... well, lagging behind the great march of history? \nJOHNNY Something like that, yeah. \nBOSS TWEED Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind. \n", "test3_id": 971}

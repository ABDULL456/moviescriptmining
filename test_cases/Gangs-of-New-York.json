{"test1_input": "JOHNNY He's our Tammany man. \nKilloran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has been keeping his own count. \nKILLORAN ... remarkable... \nAMSTERDAM (With an edge) Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of Johnny Siroccols. \nKILLORAN Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points. \nAMSTERDAM Best but one? Who's better? \nKilloran looks up. Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam, SHAKES his head \"NO\" VIGOROUSLY. Killoran gets the message. \nKILLORAN (smooth) Maybe nobody. But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's come out in front. \nAMSTERDAM I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe. \nKILLORAN Tonight. At the victory celebration. \nCUT TO \n64 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA \nA Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES, HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING, GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR... \nBOSS TWEED (V.O.) Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ... \n... and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription. \n64 CONTINUED: \nWELL-WISHER \"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes.\" \nTWEED A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany. Now, tell 'em what it means, Mayor Wood. \nWOOD \"Fortune favors the bold.\" \nTWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back. \nBOSS TWEED What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City? \nWOOD Well, I could certainly see ... \nKILLORAN (interrupting) We've got a motto. \nBOSS TWEED what is it? (no one knows) Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor, you'll make sure the Latin's right? \nAs Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room... \n... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA... \n... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by \nCHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST... \n... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists. \nEveryone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER. \nAbove the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST... \n... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER. \nBOUNCER I don't know you, you don't enter. \nAMSTERDAM (enjoying himself) Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week. \nJOHNNY (more temperate) Daniel Killoran knows us. \nBOUNCER Oh he does? \nJOHNNY We work for him. \nAMSTERDAM The hell we do. \nJOHNNY (to Amsterdam) Tampen down, will you? \nBOUNCER Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go on! \nHe SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now, and they step forward together toward the Bouncer... \n... until Killoran intervenes. \nKILLORAN (to Bouncer) It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's work for a good wage. \nKilloran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes firmly. \nKILLORAN A fine first showing. But second best. \nAMSTERDAM Second, eh? You don't say so. \nKILLORAN It's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always sweep the field. \nAMSTERDAM What? \nKILLORAN We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday. \nAMSTERDAM (to Johnny, glaring) Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours? \nJOHNNY No, I didn't have no idea ... \n", "test1_true": "KILLORAN That's only right. Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout the Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone ... \nAMSTERDAM I sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with him, or any who calls him one of theirs. \nKILLORAN Well, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a further insult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me... \nHe REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his hand away. \nAMSTERDAM Where is he? Where's Bill the Butcher? \nKILLORAN Listen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If you and Bill Poole have matters to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give a good dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five Points will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could, as the Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration. Personally, I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't you? \nAmsterdam stares at him as we... \nCUT TO \n65 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA \nAs a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in the middle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them... \n... past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in the evening, and everyone has been drinking. Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES ... \n..Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyone pays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, and NEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due.... \n... while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his eye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny. Johnny takes advantage of the situation. \nJOHNNY I got experience. It's the education I lack. \nJENNY And you heard I was a good teacher? \nJOHNNY I don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be good at everything you did. \nJENNY That's right. \nJOHNNY And tonight I got the ned. \nJENNY And now what? \nJOHNNY Now I'm ready for you. Unless there's an arrangement between you and Amsterdam. \nJENNY (glancing over at Amsterdam) Not to my thinking. \nJOHNNY (needs to be sure) Amsterdam... listen up, Amsterdam... \nAmsterdam glances over at them. \nJENNY (to Johnny) You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't have to ask him nothing. \nAMSTERDAM What? \nJOHNNY (makes his decision) How's the evening passing? \nAMSTERDAM Fine. Why? \nJOHNNY (puts his arm around Jenny) 'Cause it's treating me fine too. \nShe gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny following her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS toward Jenny. \nAMSTERDAM This is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game. \nJENNY I said already, it's not a game. It's business. \nJohnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam's gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again... \n... and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam, take him all in... but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK steps up to pay court.... \n.... and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS ... \nMASTER OF REVELS Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please ... we will now... raise the cages and start the bidding! \nThe Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISE the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the second-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even as the cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women and children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation, trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible in their impossibly cramped space. \nJohnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the door behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE... \n... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead center of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY. He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all his butcher's implements. \nThe place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge wooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise from the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now. \nThe Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED toward the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT and SHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself. \nNow the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS. The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously... \n...and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knife MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot. She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING... \n... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful, deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been, or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar; the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. When one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKS knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole. \nNative Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. They AVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too sober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB his hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes. \nCenter floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ... \n... as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple of Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ring they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escort him to Bill ... \n... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer. They land on the floor, inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the Natives bring the Groper to Bill. \nBILL THE BUTCHER Evening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to be famous? \nGROPER How much will it cost? \nBILL THE BUTCHER Just a moment of your time. My men will assist you. \nThey do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion. \n", "test1_id": 969, "test2_input": "He sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins. \n79 CONTINUED: \nJOHNNY Did your mother have the same color? \nI don't know. \nJOHNNY (as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders) Lie back, I want to look at you. (his eyes glide along her body) What's that mark? \nEMMA LOSS I always had it. \nJOHNNY (touching her lightly) And there? Is that a scar? \nEMMA LOSS (she looks at her naked belly) There was a baby. They cut it out. \nJOHNNY And that on your shoulder? That looks old. \nEMMA LOSS Yeah, I got that when I ... \nJOHNNY (interrupting, quiet) I don't want to know when. Don't tell me about before or what you used to be, I don't want that. \nEMMA LOSS What about your scars. Do you have scars? \nJOHNNY None I ever seen. Maybe you can find them. \nHer hands and mouth cover his body. He closes his eyes. \nCUT TO \n80 INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCEIS \nAnother room. Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny walks in. \nAMSTERDAM Go on. I can see you later. Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny. \nJENNY What are you doing? \nAMSTERDAM I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of business. You understand business. \nJENNY Sure I do. But there's something else I still don't understand. At Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me? \nAMSTERDAM Yeah. I did. \nShe HITS him. In the face. Hard. Not a slap. A solid PUNCH. His nose starts to gush blood. He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow, keeping his eyes an her. \nJENNY Meantime's over. \nAMSTERDAM Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much blood. \nJenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his nose. \nJENNY Put your head back. \nAMSTERDAM That don't work. \nJENNY Put your head back I said. \nAMSTERDAM (as she tends to him) So why so sudden, then? \nJENNY Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain I can't decide. Now I decide, you say it's sudden. \nAMSTERDAM It's the whore did it, then. \nJENNY Don't flatter yourself. \nAMSTERDAM It's because you're jealous. \nJENNY It's because you didn't lie about hitting me. \nAMSTERDAM Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then. \nHe reaches to pull her down on the bed. \nJENNY Not here. There's too much past. \nCUT TO \n81 INT. ROOM/DEAD RABBIT HOUSE \nThe room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight. Amsterdam and Jenny have just made love. \nJENNY It must be morning. \nAMSTERDAM I don't care, I'm not getting up. \nJENNY This is what you meant, then? It's going to be just the same from now on? \nAMSTERDAM What? \nJENNY Every morning I wake up next to you. \nAMSTERDAM Or you don't wake up at all. \nJENNY We only just started in and you're already threatening me. \nAMSTERDAM It's not a threat. (no teasing now) It's a declaration of love. \nJENNY I prefer my kind. This kind. \nShe reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine DIAMOND RING, which she slips on his finger. Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of course) suspicion. \n", "test2_true": "JENNY You said I was the best thief in the Five Points. But I got restless. Will you wear something I got? \nCUT TO \n82 EXT- UPTOWN STREET DAY \nA long street of tree-shaded houses. Spacious lawns. North of the Five Points. Considerably north. This is the first time we have been outside the Five Points and Paradise Square. The city rent place. \nJenny and Amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street. Amsterdam, dressed in a suit, can't quite conceal his wonder as he stands staring at the house. \nAMSTERDAM What is this place? \nJENNY My jeweler's. \nShe GESTURES for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a maid's outfit. \nJENNY Come on. \nAMSTERDAM I don't see nobody. \nJENNY That's the best time. They're all having lunch. \nCUT TO \n83 EXT. UPTOWN HOUSE DAY \nAt the back door of the grand house, as Jenny OPENS it slowly and glances inside. \nAMSTERDAM You're off your head. \nJENNY (pleased, showing off) You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if you're scared. (Amsterdam looks at her) Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their doors open. They live like they're not in New York. \nShe GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly through an open kitchen door. \nHe WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal; SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension. \nHe loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his arm she surprises him thoroughly. \nJENNY Come on. I might still be taken for a maid. But you're nobody's notion of a butler. \n84 EXT. UPTOWN STREET DAY \nAs Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house. She holds his arm. They look young and full of hope, like a servant couple just over from the old country enjoying a day off. \nJENNY The Police Commissioner lives the next street over. I was thinking of visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods. They keep all their graft in cash. \nAmsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual. She opens her satchel a little way, then NUDGES him to have a lock at the swag inside. \nJENNY How's that for ten minutes? \nAMSTERDAM It's a lot to fence. \nJENNY I'm not going to fence it. I'm going to keep it and take it where no one will recognize it. \nAMSTERDAM Where would that be? \nJENNY Somewhere west. Far west. Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into that territory. \nAMSTERDAM That's a hard journey for a woman alone. \nJENNY You'd be with me. \nAMSTERDAM You got it all planned and straight, is that it? \nJENNY Once I said I'd be with you I wanted someplace we could be together. Someplace better than here. What's the matter with that? \nAMSTERDAM Nothing. Except there's no place but here for me right now. I got to settle things. \nJENNY Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about settling down, not settling debts. \nAMSTERDAM You don't have my obligations. \nCUT TO \n85 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nThe Dead Rabbits SWEEP across the bustling square, Johnny and Amsterdam in the lead. \nJOHNNY It's a fair day's wage. We just move the people out of the building, and collect. \nAMSTERDAM Who from? \nJOHNNY Who owns the building. (points) Them. \nThe gang approaches a tumbledown BUILDING called Jacob's Ladder because of the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof. Two well-dressed GENTS stare at the building fretfully. \nGENT 1 (to Johnny) I'm glad you came in force. There's half a hundred people still in there. \nGENT 2 Maybe more. \nGENT 1 And not one's given rent the whole year. \nAMSTERDAM You live here? \nGENT 1 No, no, of course not. \nAMSTERDAM I mean in the city. A ways north, I'll bet. \nGENT 2 Yes. Why? \nA RIFLE SHOT sounds from an upper window and a Rabbit falls wounded. They all DUCK FOR COVER. \n", "test2_id": 970, "test3_input": "... the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, a half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his fierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated headline over his picture: \"Fresh Scourge of the Five Points.\" The date reads \"June, 1863.11 \nAMSTERDA.M (V.O.) And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended. \nFrom this illustration, we quickly... \nDISSOLVE TO \n92 EXT. RIVER DAY \n... Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to \nhis feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring. \nAMSTERDAM Now! Finish him now! \nFar up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators. \nJOHNNY Our man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry? \nFIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears carrying a sign announcing \"Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter 2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD off his knuckles. \nA GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum . \nBARNUM I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ... (indicates one side of the ring) ... and the Native Americans. \nHe FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives. Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition. \nBARNUM Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition. With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wonders that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway... \nThere are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism. \nBARNUM ... P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural, from nature and from myth! (continued boos) And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents.. (indicated fighters) ... fists up! \nThe Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging. A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck, the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place again. \nJOHNNY Dobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives has never lost before. \nAMSTERDAM Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before. \nJOHNNY That'll shame them thorough. \nAMSTERDAM There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range. \nIt's time to squeeze the trigger, John. \nThe next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other furiously. \nJOHNNY Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammany pushing back. \nAMSTERDAM That don't matter any more. \nJOHNNY It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heart and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're going to have to throw in with Tammany some way. \nThe action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2. \nJOHNNY They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been! \nIn the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time KNOCKS HIM COLD. \nAMSTERDAM (indicates Fighter 1) You call that strong, John? \nIn the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam WAVES them back. \nAMSTERDAM (to Johnny) This is our time now! \nBARNUM (trying to make official announcement) The winner... gentlemen, please! ... the winner in the 39th round is the Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ... please, gentlemen! \nThe unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdam iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but the champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum. \nBARNUM Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdam promises ... (Amsterdam whispers to him briefly) \n... something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest these are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong ever done in the Five Points. \nThe crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. Only Johnny seems glum, concerned. \nThis is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death... \nAMSTERDAM (interrupting, emphasizing) To the death. If he can stand up to it. \nBARNUM ... on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The names of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ... and Mr. William Poole, known to all as ... \nBILL THE BUTCHER (leaping up) They know me by any name, you son of a bitch! \nThe crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down and cool him off. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (yelling) I'll have him stretched on a spit! \nKilloran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakes his head vehemently. \nBILL THE BUTCHER (to Killoran) You got no more to say about this now. \n92 CONTINUED: \nAMSTERDAM Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your terms. \nKILLORAN (to Bill) Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels. \nBILL THE BUTCHER I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my attention. (yelling to Amsterdam) Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done. \nHe walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam. \n", "test3_true": "AMSTERDAM I remember it better from another time. \nHe takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on. \nCUT TO \n93 INT./EXT. DRAFT REGISTRATION OFFICE \nSTART CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher- \nBut we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second, very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN. \nCLERK Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act. Keep it somewhere safe. \nPROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN I'll keep it with me. \nThere is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man, and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous Young Man heads for the door... \n... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves. \nDRAFTEE 1 Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too. \nDRAFTEE 2 Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg. \nThe Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves. \nPROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but... \nBOSS TWEED No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300 exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced. \nThe Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran. \nKILLORAN You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to hurt us in elections. \nBOSS TWEED It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them. (to Draftees) Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of crisis! \nDRAFTEE 4 We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what! \nBOSS TWEED Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how... \nDRAFTEE 5 Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you fight! \nDRAFTEE 6 That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see! \nBOSS TWEED (as he backs off) Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding. (to Killoran) Holy Mother. \nTweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees snakes down the block and into Paradise Square. \nBOSS TWEED Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you think Amsterdam will do our work for us first. \nKILLORAN He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern \nBOSS TWEED Not so daunting as this. (turns to the Draftees in the street) Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great struggle... \nThere is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside. \nOUTSIDE DRAFTEE Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind! \nBOSS TWEED Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days? \nCUT TO \n94 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY \nElection Day pandemonium. The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans--identifiable because of their long dusters--strongarm REPEATERS into the polls. \nHis attention is drawn to a HARRIED TELEGRAPH OPERATOR, who is being SHOUTED at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering volumes of the voting registry. It's chaos. The poor Operator can't cope. \nCUT TO \n95 INT. TAMMANY HALL \nIt's chaos here, too. The large main room is filled with TELEGRAPH OPERATORS receiving election returns. There is SHOUTING and CONCERN throughout the room. Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry. \nBOSS TWEED I swear that science will be the death of industry. \nKILLORKN The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get the repeaters in and out. \nBOSS TWEED (losing patience) Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain. (Killoran looks at him blankly) Do something! \nJOHNNY If you'll allow me. \nThey both TURN to see Johnny standing coolly before them. \nJOHNNY There's a scheme we might try. \nKILLORAN You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come in. \nBOSS TWEED A moment please, Daniel. One moment. (to Johnny) You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam? (Johnny nods) And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here? \nJOHNNY Opportunity. Science and opportunity. \nKILLORAN You got opportunities enough among your own. \nJOHNNY I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And I like to stay with the advantage. \nBOSS TWEED Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps you're even saying... that your friend and your gang may be ... well, lagging behind the great march of history? \nJOHNNY Something like that, yeah. \nBOSS TWEED Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind. \n", "test3_id": 971}

SCHINDLER Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact. 
The threat still stands, despite Schindler's assurance otherwise, and they all know it. So does Scherner's threat back to him, and they all know that, too. But Schindler just grins, and, glancing away -- 
SCHINDLER Come on, let's watch the girls. 
INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY 
In addition to the mid-day soup and break, there are bowls of fruit on the long work tables. At one of them, several workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank Schindler. 
INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICES, D.E.F. - SAME TIME - DAY 
In honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison. 
Surrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake. 
He receives congratulations from the many SS men present and the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth. 
From Stern he gets a handshake. 
A Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly approaches the drunken group around Schindler. The SS men consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any beautiful girl. The music breaks and out of the silence comes a small nervous voice: 
FACTORY GIRL ...On behalf of the workers... sir... I wish you a happy birthday... 
She hesitates. She's surrounded by SS uniforms and swastikas and holstered guns. Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful girl. 
SCHINDLER Thank you. 
He kisses her on the mouth. The smiles on the faces around them strain. Stern glances to heaven. Amon cocks his head like a confused dog. The kiss is broken, finally, and Schindler smiles again with impunity. 
SCHINDLER Thank them for me. 
The girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets shot. Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song. 
And the party tries to resume. 
EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAWN 
Were they not asleep in their barracks, the prisoners would no doubt shudder at the sight: the clerks are setting up their folding tables. 
Other figures move around the parade ground in the murky dawn light: these raising a banner, those wheeling filing cabinets across the Appellplatz, this one wiring a phonograph, that one saturating a pad with ink from a bottle. 
Goldberg, Lord of Lists, moves from table to table handing out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with the clerks. 
Some men in white appear like ghosts. A doctor's kid is opened, a stethoscope removed. Another cleans the lenses of his glasses. Someone sharpens a pencil. 
EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAWN 
A trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer who's slowly backing an empty cattle car along the tracks. It couples to another empty slatted car with a harsh clank. 
EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY 
The needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked 78. The first scratchy note of a Strauss waltz blare from the camp speakers. 
EXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - DAY 
In his undershirt and shorts Goeth calmly smokes his first cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting up from down below. 
Down there on the Appellplatz, the entire population of the camp has been concentrated, some fifteen thousand prisoners. 
EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY 
Though the music and banners struggle to evoke a country fair, the presence of the doctors belie it. A sorting out process is going on here, the healthy from the unhealthy. 
A physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him. He makes his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names. 
Other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors and clerks. Notations are made and lines are formed. The sun beats down and the music lies. 
EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY 
Some still pulling their clothes back on, the first wave of the "unfit" is marched onto the platform. A guard slides open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group climbs aboard. 
EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY 
Behind the camouflage of other women prisoners, Mila Pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope of adding a little color to her skin. 
Amon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, chats with one of the doctors as another group strips. 
Whether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly. 
PFEFFERBERG (O.S.) Commandant, sir. 
Goeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off their clothes. Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that asks, Do I really have to go through this, and Goeth turns to a clerk. 
GOETH My mechanic. 
Pfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he doesn't have to be put through this indignity. He calls out to the Commandant again -- 
PFEFFERBERG What about my wife? 
Goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay, sure. A clerk accompanies Pfefferberg and, making a notation on the way, finds Mila.

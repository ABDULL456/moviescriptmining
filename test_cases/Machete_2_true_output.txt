ELEKTRA Just listen. Michael Booth orchestrated the assassination attempt on McLaughlin's life. 
BOSS (ON PHONE) His own advisor? 
ELEKTRA That's right. This was all some kind of hare-brained scheme to call off the ethics investigation. I think I can get Machete to testify. 
BOSS (ON PHONE) You do, huh? Well that doesn't matter because no charges are going to be filed against Booth. 
ELEKTRA What? 
BOSS (ON PHONE) The order's come down from top brass: No more black eyes on DHS. Bring in the Mexican. Dead or alive. Now are you gonna DO your fucking job or are you gonna LOSE your fucking job? 
Elektra is stunned. 
BOSS (CONT'D) (ON PHONE) Agent Rivers! Agent Rivers! Answer me, goddamnit! RNewman / Endeavor Draft 60. 
Elektra hangs up, throws the cellphone into the bowl of green onion gunk. 
She looks around for Machete, but he's disappeared while she was on the phone. 
INT. CHURCH, INNER ROOM 
Padre sits at a computer, with streaming webcam video of June and April on the screen. 
PADRE What do you want me to do with this? We can't keep them locked up forever. 
EXT. ARMORY - NIGHT 
Battered trucks roll in. 
INT. ARMORY 
Makeshift infirmary for the wounded. 
Von oversees the patching up of several of his men. 
VON The day is upon us, my friends. We'll take down the interloper, and anyone who gets in our way. 
Subdued chorus of mild approval. 
VON (CONT'D) Do you believe in freedom?! 
Louder chants of "yeah!" 
VON (CONT'D) Will you die for freedom! 
Louder -- "YEAH!" 
VON (CONT'D) If that's what it takes to make you free, I will kill you with my own bare hands, Amen. 
The men look at each other as if trying to gauge the big man's sanity. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 61. 
VON (CONT'D) Heal up, brothers. Heal up good. The day is upon us. 
INT. SNIPER'S CAR, MOVING - NIGHT 
Sniper patrols the streets, looking for Machete. 
His cellphone beeps with notice of a video message -- LINK TO APRIL'S WEBSITE. 
He checks it out -- the WEBCAM footage of April and June naked in the windowless room. 
SNIPER Oh shit. 
INT. BENZ'S OFFICE/INT. SNIPER'S CAR 
Benz calls him. He clicks over from the message with his bluetooh earpiece so he can still see the webcam video. 
SNIPER Yeah. 
BENZ (ON PHONE) You seeing this?

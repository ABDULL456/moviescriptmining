INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT. 
A bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, and Arthur is knocked back violently. 
Rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified knights. They and the priest back away. Arthur is left alone. He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. He kneels before it. Steam hisses up as rain falls on it. 
INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY 
Sun streams in. Many of the knights are in attendance, in full armor. 
Ladies and pages watch from dark corners. Arthur addresses the fellowship. 
He holds the cracked chalice in his hands. He burns with a new-found fervor. 
ARTHUR Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again? 
Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute. 
SIR GAWAIN I will ride forth in the name of that quest, and commit my strength and my soul to it. 
Perceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch their lips to the blades in oath. Sunbeams splash off their armor. 
PERCEVAL I will go. 
The rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, but the resolution within them is not strong. Arthur comes forward to Gawain. 
ARTHUR Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more... 
He embraces Gawain, tears in his eyes. He turns to Perceval, and Perceval kneels. 
PERCEVAL We will find the secret or die. 
Arthur kisses the young knight's brow. Then he turns to Kay. 
ARTHUR Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, but I am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side. 
Arthur and Kay watch the knights file out till the hall is empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant. 
FADE OUT: 
A LEGEND APPEARS: 
"For nine years they searched. Morgana's power grew in the land." 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SNOWSCAPE - DAY 
Under a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling snow. He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his tracks. He brushes the snow from the man's face. The frozen features belong to Caradoc. He slowly continues on his way. 
EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY 
Dangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting flesh in the chinks of armor. Perceval rides up, cries out in horror, and spurs his horse away. 
EXT. MOORS - DAY 
The rotting carcasses of sheep. The crops blackened and withered on the stalk. Hungry peasants head for a distant hill. 
EXT, HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY 
A giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its stone mouth gaping toward the sky. 
People are congregated around the mouth. Peasants and farmers, they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing and bagpipes wailing. 
They watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark armor. At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold as his mother's. Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her sweat-drenched body. 
She is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's open mouth. It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there. Before her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong men who hold him. Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into Gawain's chest. The fountain of blood that gushes from the great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy. 
MORGANA (intoning) The blood of this knight will feed the god in the earth, he is weak with hunger, and he will be made strong by this blood. Then he will plant his seed, and the land will be fertile once again. 
Gawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, looks up in anguish. His bellowing voice is echoed and amplified by the hollow beneath the drain. 
GAWAIN Arthur, forgive me. I die without the secret. I have failed.

Whose shift is that? MICHAEL Well... I thought you might do it... 
PETER Not a    chance! I'm not doing the night    shift. I absolutely refuse. I have    too much work to catch up on for    the competition. JACK Well, needless to say I refuse, too! 
MICHAEL Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit. PETER You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball! We give you the easiest shift: the morning. She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she's your daughter. Are you that horny? JACK (extremely pissed off) Hey, horny yourself! I don't give a shit. I don't need you guys. I'll find some other way to do it. And I won't take the New York-Washington shuttle! He exits, furious. 
104   INT. CHARTER COMPANY - DAY                            104 Jack is coming out of   an office that says "EXECUTIVE OFFICES." He is grim    and sullen-looking. He runs into his friend Paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a potential mishap with   Jack. PAUL (shyly) Hi, Jack, something wrong? 
JACK (who hadn't noticed him) Oh, hi... Nah, nothing's wrong. PAUL What were you doing in the boss's office? JACK I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months. PAUL Oh, and he said 'no,' huh? 
JACK (barking) As a matter of fact, he said 'yes.' Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms. Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches him go, totally confused. 
105   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 105 Jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown. He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms. The basket is on the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down again and doesn't move. Mary falls back asleep. Jack looks at her skin, her hands. Very gently, he kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep. 
106   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - MORNING                                  106 Michael is working at his drafting table.      Jack rushes in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out. JACK Okay, I'm off. She's well fed and she's sleeping now. We hear MARY CRYING. JACK Shit, she's crying.      I'll go pick her up... Peter passes him in the corridor.      He, too, is ready to go out to his office. PETER 
Let her cry, she's just trying to get to sleep, she'll stop in a couple of minutes. JACK No, she needs to burp -- I've gotta rock her for a little... PETER I'm telling you, the more you pick her up, the longer it'll take her to get to sleep. JACK Thanks for the advice -- now why don't you just shove it? I know you let her scream for hours but I can't. PETER (in a state of shock) I never let her scream for hours! JACK You'd resort to any theory to not take care of her. Just because you've read some books... PETER Can you believe what he just said to me... I read those books bec... JACK It's not your shift, anyway. Piss off, will ya? MICHAEL Come on, guys, cool it! It's my shift now. (to Jack) I'll rock her for a few minutes... (to Peter) ... and then I'll put her right to bed. So off to work, both of you. He pushes them both out.

THE COUNTESS Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman. 
Suddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and leans forward. Lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly, intensely into Sissy's blue eyes. His smile widens. 
THE COUNTESS By the way, Sissy... he's a full blooded Indian.

COWGIRL INTERLUDE 
INT. RUBBER ROSE OUTHOUSE DAY 
The Outhouse Radio is playing "The Starving Armenians Polka" and Bonanza Jellybean and Delores del Ruby are in the privy, caught in the rain. 
JELLY Well, I'm not scared of a little rain. 
DELORES Me neither. 
JELLY Might as well brave it. 
DELORES Right. I don't know about you but I'm sure not sweet enough to melt. 
Delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge in the privy and hits the photograph of Dale Evans upon which it has lit. 
Jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other cowgirls. 
There is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip. Way off horse lips flutter. 
Bonanza spies a picture of Sissy Hankshaw, an advertisement for Yoni Yum Dew Spray mist, on the privy wall. 
JELLY (musing) Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken. Chickens are the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize. If you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds, it's yours forever. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE DAY 
A meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning. Mary is addressing the group. 
MARY I want to complain that some of the cowgirls have been sleeping two to a bunk again, in violation of the agreement that "crimes against nature" are to be confined to the hayloft. 
DEBBIE I don't care who lay with whom or where or how, but the moaners, groaners and screamers ought to turn down their volume when others are trying to sleep or meditate. 
Some of the younger cowgirls blush. 
BIG RED I want to complain about the food around here! It's rotten to the core. 
A round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of cattle calls.

ACTOR THOR I will. 
ACTOR LOKI Build a statue for me. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                11. 
ACTOR THOR We will build a big statue for you. 
ACTOR LOKI With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns. 
ACTOR THOR I will tell Father what you did here today. 
Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him. 
ACTOR LOKI I didn't do it for him. 
Actor Loki then "dies". 
ACTOR THOR Noooooo!!! 
The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward. 
ACTOR ODIN And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours. He fought back those disgusting dark elves. He brought peace to the realm. 
He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms. 
ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D) Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield. 
Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next to him is openly SOBBING at the play. 
ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D) On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard's savior. No. You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool's heart. 
The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION. 
ODIN Bravo!    Bravo! Well done.   Bravo. 
THOR Father. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   12. 
Odin sees Thor taking a knee.   Curses under his breath: 
ODIN Oh, shit. (then, announcing) My son! Thor has returned! Greetings my boy. 
Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up. 
THOR It's an interesting play.    What's it called? 
ODIN The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him. 
THOR Indeed they should. (provoking) I like that statue. A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though. A little less weasely. Less greasy maybe. 
Odin sours, masking his agitation.    Thor holds up the skull. 
THOR (CONT'D) You know what this is? 
ODIN (ADR) The skull of Surtur? That's a formidable weapon. 
Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over. 
THOR Do me a favor. Lock this in a vault so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet. 
ODIN So it's back to Midgard for you, is it? 
Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin. 
THOR Nope. I've been having this reocurring dream lately. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                13. 
THOR (CONT'D) Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins... 
ODIN That's just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination. 
THOR Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate. And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos. Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes. 
ODIN Well, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom. 
THOR Of course, the freedom to be massacred. 
ODIN Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself. 
THOR Watching theatre. 
ODIN Board meetings, and security council meetings... 
THOR You really going to make me do it? 
ODIN Do what? 
Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance, GRABS Odin by the back of the neck. 
Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away. 
THOR You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand. 
Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                14. 
THOR (CONT'D) Not even your face. 
ODIN You've gone quite mad.     You'll be executed for this! 
Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles. 
THOR Then I'll see you on the other side...brother. 
The jig is up.   A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:

SMASH TO: 
84   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER                         84 
A SHAKY and grainy VIDEO IMAGE appears on Kale's computer screen. Kale picks up one of Ronnie's old walkie-talkies. 
KALE (into walkie talkie as needed) You read? 
RONNIE (V.O.) (walkie talkie filter as needed) Yeah, you got a signal? 
ON KALE'S COMPUTER SCREEN - Ronnie suddenly aims THE VIDEO CAMERA AT HIS FACE. 
KALE Got video, no audio. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Yeah, mic's on the fritz.    How am I looking? 
Kale picks up the binoculars. 
BINOCULAR POV - Giles' garage door is still open.     There's a light on at the opposite end of the house. 
KALE Light on, far end. 
RONNIE (V.O.) I guess it's now or never.    Moving out.

Kale turns back to the computer screen -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - His feet dart across the yard -- he TILTS UP -- approaching the fence. 
KALE (re: Giles) No movement. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie hops the fence. 
RONNIE (V.O.) First hurdle -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - The image goes to SNOW for a split second -- the signal weakening... 
Kale peers out the window -- 
BINOCULAR POV - We barely make out Ronnie's silhouette as he makes his way toward the garage -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Twenty feet.     Ten feet -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Rapidly approaching the back of Giles' Toyota. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Garage -- 
RONNIE'S   DV CAM POV - Very shaky as Ronnie makes his way to the back   seat door -- he takes out a pen light, aims it at the door   as his hand enters frame, lifts up on the latch. The door   pops open. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Bingo. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We see Ronnie's hand feeling around the back seat floor of Giles' car. 
Kale's CALL WAITING suddenly BEEPS. He looks at the CALLER I.D: ASHLEY. Shit. He has to let it go. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I'm not seeing it -- 
KALE Stay calm, it's there. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie's hand finally pulls out the cell phone.

84   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                      84 
RONNIE (V.O.) I've got it. 
BINOCULAR POV - Giles' house.       Still no sign of movement. 
KALE You're still clear, check the bag. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Hang on -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We see Ronnie's hand gently push the door of Giles' Toyota closed. The angle TILTS DOWN -- we're now watching Ronnie's feet as they stride deeper into the garage, walking in between the Toyota and Mustang. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I'm setting the camera on the trunk. 
KALE Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) I'm checking the bag first. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie sets the camera on the trunk of the Mustang, aims it perfectly at the BLUE BAG sitting in the corner. We watch with Kale as Ronnie enters frame, crouched low, heading toward the bag. He raises the walkie talkie -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It does look like blood -- and hair -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie kneels down, starts to open the bag. But suddenly, the still POV suddenly STARTS TO SLOWLY, STEADILY TRACK TO THE LEFT -- And Kale realizes -- 
KALE The camera's sliding -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie spins and grabs the camera.

It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing. 
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX. 
Locked. 
GIRL No!!! 
She fumbles in her coat, takes out the SCISSORS, uses them to try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be frozen shut, not locked after all.) 
It finally yields, opening.

Revealing a rat's nest of multicolored WIRES and PHONE JACKS. 
Hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with her bare hand retrieves the cord-wrapped RECEIVER from inside her sweater. In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS... 
Which drop all the   way down to disappear in the snow below. 
She concentrates now on the receiver.    But her fingers are so clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it. 
And the receiver FALLS too. 
Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord. 
Which she's managed to catch. She winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box. 
Hears a DIAL TONE. 
GIRL (cont'd) (stunned she did it) Oh my god! 
Teeth chattering she thumbs "0" for the operator. 
GIRL (cont'd) (as it rings) Please please please please please- 
On the third ring an OPERATOR answers. 
OPERATOR (filtered) Nine-one-one emergency response. 
GIRL Thank god! Hi! Hello! We need help! 
OPERATOR (filtered) What's that? Can you repeat- 
GIRL We're on highway 606! Oh god, please hurry! We need help! My friend is hurt- 
OPERATOR Can you repeat your-

GIRL Hello? Hello? 
The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone. When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD. 
No way of knowing if her message got through. 
It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth. 
81   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                           81 
CLOSE ON THE RADIO playing nothing but STATIC now. 
82   EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE                       82 
Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth. 
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet. The snow does little to cushion her fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment. 
She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon- 
A WOMAN'S BARE FEET 
standing in the snow, veins visible through gravid skin. 
A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot. 
Our girl raises her eyes to see - 
A DEAD WOMAN 
It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of 1958. Her dress is in tattered ruins, coated in leaves and dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave. 
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck.

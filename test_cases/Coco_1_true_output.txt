TÍO OSCAR Size seven... 
TÍO FELIPE ...and a half. 
TÍA VICTORIA Pronated. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel. 
Pepita leans forward, breathes again, and the glow spreads to reveal a trail of footprints. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NARROW STAIRWAY 
Miguel follows Héctor down a steep stairway.     Miguel looks to his bony knuckles, concern on his face. 
HÉCTOR Why the heck would you wanna be a musician? 
MIGUEL My great-great grandpa was a musician. 
HÉCTOR ...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, guácala, no... 
MIGUEL Whadda you know? 
As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings. 
MIGUEL So, how far is this guitar anyway? 
HÉCTOR We're almost there... 
Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground below. But his bones reassemble immediately. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Keep up, chamaco, come on! 
Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway. 
EXT. SHANTY TOWN 
Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings the color of marigolds. 
Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and dusty, not unlike Héctor, but there's a camaraderie about them. 
RATTY GROUP COUSIN HÉCTOR!! 
HÉCTOR Eh!   These guys! 
RATTY MEMBER HÉCTOR!! 
HÉCTOR Hey Tío!   Qué onda! 
MIGUEL These people are all your family? 
HÉCTOR Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? (beat) So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever. 
They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up. 
TÍA CHELO Héctor! 
HÉCTOR Tía Chelo!     He-hey! 
Héctor hands them a bottle. 
OLD TIAS Muchas gracias! 
HÉCTOR Hey, hey! Save some for me!      Is Chicharrón around? 
TÍA CHELO In the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors... 
HÉCTOR Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor? 
INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT 
Héctor holds the curtain open.       Miguel and Dante walk in. 
The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over. 
Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of CHICHARRÓN. 
HÉCTOR Buenas noches, Chicharrón! 
CHICHARRÓN I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor. 
HÉCTOR C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I brought you a little offering! 
CHICHARRÓN Get out of here... 
HÉCTOR I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar. 
CHICHARRÓN My guitar?! 
HÉCTOR Yes? 
CHICHARRÓN My prized, beloved guitar...? 
HÉCTOR I promise we'll bring it right back. 
Chicharrón sits up, incensed.

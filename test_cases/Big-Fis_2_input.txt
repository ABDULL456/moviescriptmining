Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can. The dog bounds after it, 
SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS. 
It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth. 
EDWARD It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties. 
Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new direction. 
TRANSITION TO: 
EXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN 
Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned. 
He follows it into the woods. 
INT. WOODS - DAWN 
Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches. 
AMOS Didn't kill anything, did I? 
EDWARD A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead. 
AMOS That would explain the indigestion. 
Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates. 
AMOS I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. 
EDWARD There's only one I want. 
A beat. 
AMOS Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry. 
EDWARD Thank you. 
AMOS Good luck, kid. 
Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there as soon as possible. 
Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. 
EXT. BIG TOP - DAY 
Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug. 
EDWARD (V.O.) After saying my goodbyes, I hopped three trains to get to Auburn that afternoon. 
EXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY 
We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain. 
He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era. 
EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY 
Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half- open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. 
Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight. 
He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. 
EDWARD You don't know me, but my name is Edward Bloom and I am in love with you. I've spent the last three years working to find out who you are. I've been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it's all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you. Because I am destined to marry you. I knew that from the first moment I saw you at the circus. And I know it now more than ever. 
ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say is... 
SANDRA I'm sorry. 
EDWARD Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today... 
She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, we see a diamond. 
SANDRA No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be married. 
ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front. 
EDWARD Oh. 
SANDRA But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you. 
FLASHCUTS TO: 
EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT 
Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.

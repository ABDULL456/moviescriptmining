Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. 
DIL Why are we going here, Jimmy? 
FERGUS Look on it like a honeymoon. 
INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT. 
From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. 
Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. 
EXT. SITE - EVENING. 
A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. 
INT. SITE - EVENING. 
Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. 
JUDE You a handyman, Fergie? 
FERGUS I take pride in my work. 
JUDE I sincerely hope so. 
Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. 
JUDE Tools of the trade. 
She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. 
JUDE And forget about the girl. 
Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. 
INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT. 
Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. 
FERGUS Dil? 
No reply. He runs outside. 
EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. 
Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her. 
FERGUS Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here? 
DIL I'm going home! 
FERGUS Told you to stay in the hotel! 
DIL Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me. 
They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very drunk. 
FERGUS I had to go to work! 
DIL Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy. 
He takes her arm. 
FERGUS Come on... 
DIL No! I'm going home... 
Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat. 
DIL So tell me. 
FERGUS I was trying to get out of something. 
DIL No! Tell me everything, Jimmy. 
Fergus looks at her. 
FERGUS You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil. 
DIL You mean that? 
FERGUS Yes. 
And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue. 
FERGUS Stop it, would you?

ON STARLING, IN THE ROOM, AS SHE PICKS UP A SMALL ROSEBUD FROM THE CUT CRYSTAL BUDVASE IN FRONT OF HER. 
SHE LOOKS AT IT WOOZILY, AND IT FALLS FROM HER FINGERS. SHE BENDS DOWN. 
ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR. 
THE ROSEBUD, ON A FILTHY, TORN LINOLEUM FLOOR, HER LEGS ENCASED IN THE MUDDY PANTS WE SAW HER IN AT VERGER'S FARM. 
ANGLE 
ON STARLING, AS SHE STRAIGHTENS, HOLDING THE ROSE.  WE SEE A LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HER FACE.  HER FACE IS BLOODY, AND COVERED IN MUD, WE SEE SHE IS NOT IN A SUMPTUOUS DININGROOM, BUT IN A SLUM. 
ANGLE HER POV 
LECHTER, IN THE KITCHEN, IN TUXEDO, MOVING PAST THE DOORWAY. 
ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN. 
LECHTER, AS WE NOW SEE, IN THE FILTHY KITCHEN OF A SLUM. COOKING ON A HOTPLATE.  DRESSED IN WORKCLOTHES, CAMERA TAKES HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK, LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS, HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING ON THE HOTPLATE. 
ANGLE 
IN THE SLUM ROOM.  STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING. 
LECHTER (cont'd) That the institution cannot but be corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be but an act of complicity to seek to appease it. 
HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. 
LECHTER (cont'd) So many civilizations eat their slain enemies... what do you think...?  How much better to devour a person physically, than to devour his spirit. Which is, of course, the purpose of the institution. 
HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN PLATE. 
LECHTER (cont'd) (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) :and that is the especial surprise, I've prepared for You! 
STARLING I feel weak... 
LECHTER (NODDING) ...you must eat. 
SHE LOOKS DOWN AT THE TABLE.  SHE PICKS UP HER FORK. 
ANGLE HER POV 
THE LOVELY LINEN TABLE, THE STEAMING MEAT ON THE LIMOGES PLATE. 
A HUGE COCKROACH, SCURRYING ACROSS THE TABLECLOTH. 
ANGLE 
ON STARLING, AS SHE RISES, UNSTEADILY, IN HER MUDDY CLOTHES... 
STARLING ...1 don't understand... 
SHE WALKS TOWARD THE BALCONY WINDOW, LOOKING OUT AT THE OCEAN. 
ANGLE HER POV. 
OUT THE WINDOW, A SQUALID CITY STREET, SEEN FROM THE THIRD FLOOR. 
A COUPLE OF CARS STOPPING AT THE END OF THE STREET. 
ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER. 
LECHTER (IN THE KITCHEN) The gift, of course is not the meal-- but the identification--which of us does not need help?  The identity, of your true enemy...? ...for you always sought to befriend, to wish the love of those who wished you ill. 
ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE CHAIR. 
LECHTER (cont'd) Come here--he is in no pain, there are no nerves in the brain, come here... 
ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE CHAIR. 
LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A XEROX OF THE PHOTO OF THE BADGE WITH THE HOLE IN IT. 
LECHTER (CONT'D) Come here, I'm going to cure you. 
ANGLE HIS POV. 
STARLING, IN THE SLUMROOM, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
ANGLE 
STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, LECHTER COMES UP BEHIND HER, AND LOOKS OUT. 
ANGLE HIS POV. 
THE SLUM STREET, A VAN NOW PULLING UP, A SQUAD OF SWAT OFFICERS APPROACHING A PARKED CAR. 
ANGLE 
ON LECHTER AND CLARICE. 
LECHTER APPROACHES HER. 
ANGLE HIS POV, 
STARLING, IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOWN, HE MOVES AS IF TO CARESS HER BREAST. 
ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS DOWN.  WE SEE SHE IS NOW CLOTHED IN HER FILTHY CLOTHES, AND LECHTER IS FRISKING HER. 
ANGLE 
LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER. 
LECHTER (cont'd) Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on you.  How careless of me.  How finally careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? Could one not say that's the essential question of Philosophy...? 
ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON. 
STARLING Might I have some more of the wine...? 
ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW. 
STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN. 
STARLING (cont'd) Because, I find I like the effects.  You may say that it's inebriation, but it seems (SHE SMILES) This lovely evening, in particular.... it seems to reward me with clarity... (SHE LAUGHS) 
THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.  THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING HER.

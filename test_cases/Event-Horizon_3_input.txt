EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL 
The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon's airlock. 
A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress. 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE 
SMITH (to Weir) It is now. (to Miller) We're locked in. 
MILLER Starck, give me a read. 
A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen. 
STARCK The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. 
WEIR Do they have pressure? 
STARCK Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis. 
MILLER Find 'em, Starck. 
Starck frowns at her display. 
STARCK Something's wrong with the bio-scan. 
MILLER Radiation interference? 
STARCK There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location. 
WEIR Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan? 
STARCK If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense. 
MILLER Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on. 
JUSTIN Yes, sir! 
Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge. 
MILLER Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge. 
WEIR Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship... 
MILLER Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- 
WEIR (interrupting) That is not acceptable -- 
MILLER (overlapping) -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! (beat) I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job. 
Weir exhales. 
WEIR Very well.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL 
The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's airlock. 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY 
Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, without headgear. 
COOPER ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on... 
MILLER (muffled) You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens... 
COOPER I'll be all over it. 
Miller nods to Peters. 
PETERS (muffled) Opening inner airlock door. 
The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. Miller and Peters do not. 
COOPER You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins. 
JUSTIN I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man. 
Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight. 
COOPER (serious now) You just keep your nose clean, Baby Bear. Clear the door. 
Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, ECHOING through the ship. 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS 
Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's safety line trails out behind him. 
The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them. 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE 
Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck keep tabs over his shoulder. 
WEIR You've reached the outer airlock door.

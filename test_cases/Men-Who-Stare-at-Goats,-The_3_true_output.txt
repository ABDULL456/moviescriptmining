TV) Bizarre. Right? 
BOB Well...it didn't die. I thought you said you killed it? 
GUS LACEY 
(SHEEPISH) Yeah well...(He gestures to his Mother) Mother said no. She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal. She said "Don't show him the hamster dying. Show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead." Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and defiant at the same time. Gus stares at the blank TV, sips his coffee. 
GUS LACEY (CONT'D) This was nothing. You should have seen the Skipper at work. 
BOB Who's the Skipper? 
GUS LACEY Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force. (Beat) I think he runs a dance studio now.

BOB'S NOTEBOOK - as he writes down the name LYN 
CASSADY... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
19   EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - THE PRESENT - AS BEFORE             19 
ON LYN'S NAME TAG Bob straightens from lighting his cigarette, stares at Lyn. 
BOB Do you...do you know a Gus Lacey? Beat. Lyn gets up and walks away. 
BOB (CONT'D) Lyn? (Beat) Skip? (Beat) Lyn? 
20   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                      20 
Bob hurries to catch up with Lyn. He follows him around a corner and skids to a halt. Lyn is facing him, standing on one leg, hands raised above his head in an odd martial arts stance. He emits a threatening croon. Bob raises his hands nervously. 
BOB Whoa! 
LYN CASSADY You working for Hooper? 
BOB Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. 
LYN CASSADY How do you know about Lacey? 
BOB I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show. Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head ruefully. 
LYN CASSADY Little prick...what'd he tell you? 
BOB He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view? 
(MORE)                   (CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                  20 
BOB (CONT'D) And he said the Loch Ness Monster was the ghost of a dinosaur. Who's Bill Django? 
LYN CASSADY (shaking his head in 
DISGUST) Did he show you his "Home Study Course"? 
BOB Yes. 
LYN CASSADY (walking off down the 
CORRIDOR) Yeah I bet he did. 
BOB (hurrying after him) Are you...? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh...? Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot? 
LYN CASSADY 
(RUEFULLY) He is an idiot...or he was...he's dead now. He was a paranormal whore. Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We took an oath. We don't divulge... 
BOB But you're saying there was a secret unit? Lyn stops, turns and stares at him.

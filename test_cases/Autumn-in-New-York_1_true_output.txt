FOLLOW SHANNON, coming out of the ladies' room. She makes her way through the crowd-- 
SHANNON Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry! Excuse me! 
BOY'S VOICE No problem! 
She looks up and can't believe her eyes. 
BACK TO CHARLOTTE AND SIMON 
Simon, shouting above the music, speaks with difficulty -- 
SIMON There's one thing you don't know about Mr. Keane and his adultery and as painful as it is I feel that I should tell you! 
CHARLOTTE (alarmed) What? What is it! 
SIMON That woman on the roof? That was no ex-girlfriend! In fact, no woman at all. It was I, Simon Loring, master of disguise! Willsy and I have moved in together! 
Charlotte laughs and slaps him. Shannon approaches hauling by the hand ERIC BALES, 24, small, beautiful, long-haired, glasses. 
SHANNON Look what I found! 
Charlotte can't believe it either -- 
CHARLOTTE Eric! Wow! 
ERIC Hey, Char! 
They hug and kiss with some slight awkwardness, then shout above the music -- 
CHARLOTTE God, long time no see! One night we show up to rent Eraserhead and you're just gone! 
ERIC Sorry about that! 
SHANNON It was such a drag! You know, having to actually start paying to rent movies! 
ERIC I bet! 
CHARLOTTE What's up? Ralph said you moved to Rockland County! 
ERIC Yeah, I got a job working for my mom's new boyfriend! 
CHARLOTTE What does he do? 
ERIC He sells pot! 
SHANNON Cool! 
ERIC Not really. I was a driver! I got laid off when he got busted. He's awaiting trial! 
CHARLOTTE So what're you doing now? 
ERIC Same thing pretty much. Only for Domino's! 
Charlotte laughs. 
SHANNON Whoa, I don't believe it! (to Eric) She hasn't laughed in like a week! 
Eric smiles quizzically at Charlotte, wondering why. 
INT. ELYSIUM -- NIGHT 
Wills sits listening to Patty talk -- 
PATTY -- so everybody on the conference call starts introducing themselves. Ned Lewey, Paris Office. Takashi Matsuo, Tokyo Office. Whoever, the London Office. And then someone says, "Will the architect from the New York office please identify himself." And I pipe up and say, "Well, guys, I'm not a him or an architect. I'm Patty Strauss and I'm head of East Coast marketing." And there's like total silence. It was hysterical! 
Wills smiles feebly. He looks away and sees John holding the TELEPHONE, urgently signaling to him. Alarmed, Wills jumps up -- 
WILLS I'm sorry, would you excuse me? 
PATTY Of course. 
AT THE RESERVATION STAND 
Wills, fearing the worst, hurries to John -- 
WILLS Who is it? 
JOHN Nobody! 
John slams down the phone, grabs him by the arm, hauls him through the reception area and out the door. Patty watches, confused. 
EXT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS 
John walks quickly down the block, still hauling Wills -- 
JOHN Last time I checked I was your best friend!

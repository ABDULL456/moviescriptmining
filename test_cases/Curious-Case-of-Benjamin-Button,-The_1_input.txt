And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in... 
THE MAN I'm sorry... I thought you were done... 
DAISY This is a friend of my family's... Benjamin Button... this is my husband... Robert... 
They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet... 
ROBERT It was nice to have met you... We'll be in the car, darling... 
(CONTINUED) 
263   CONTINUED: (3)                                               263 
DAISY I'm just closing up... 
And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her... 
BENJAMIN She's so lovely... she looks like you... Does she dance? 
DAISY Not very well. 
BENJAMIN I suppose that would be from my side of things. 
`DAISY She's a dear sweet girl... she seems a little lost... But who isn't a little lost at 12? There's a lot of her that reminds me of you. 
And she shuts off a set of the lights. 
DAISY (CONT'D) My husband. He's a doctor... was a widower... He's an incredibly bright, adventurous man... 
Benjamin smiles. 
DAISY (CONT'D) He's been a terrific father... and a great partner and friend... 
And she shuts off the record player and another set of lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark studio... and they look at their reflections in the mirror... seeing who they are now... 
DAISY (CONT'D) You're so much younger. 
BENJAMIN Just what you can see. 
She looks at him, and after all these years... she now understands completely... she looks outside at her daughter standing by the car with her "father," waiting... 
(CONTINUED) 
263   CONTINUED: (4)                                                   263 
DAISY You ware right. She needed a father. I couldn't have raised both of you. I'm not that strong. 
He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him. 
DAISY (CONT'D) I never thought how it must have broken your heart, too. 
His silence is enough. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Where are you staying? What are you going to do? 
BENJAMIN I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the avenue. I have no idea what I'm going to do. 
And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open for him... 
DAISY I have to go. 
He nods.   He walks by her, going out. 
264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264 
She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as he crosses the street and walks off into the night... 
265   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT               265 
CAROLINE That young man was my father? 
And a Nurse comes in. 
THE NURSE The hurricane changed directions again. They are predicting it will make landfall sometime soon. 
(CONTINUED) 
265   CONTINUED:                                                       265 
CAROLINE Is there anything we need to do? 
THE NURSE Arrangements are being made to move people if we have to. I'll let you know as soon as we know anything. 
She leaves hurriedly. 
DAISY Please tell me what he says? 
Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes in... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "That night..." 
266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266 
Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if somebody was there... 
BENJAMIN Hello? 
Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there. He's startled to see her... 
DAISY May I come in? 
BENJAMIN Please... 
She comes inside...an awkward quiet... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I don't know what I'm doing here...What I expected...? 
It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly... 
DAISY Nothing lasts. 
He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what he's come to know, that some things do last... 
(CONTINUED) 
266   CONTINUED:                                                      266 
BENJAMIN I never once stopped loving you... 
He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead... 
DAISY I'm an old woman now, Benjamin. 
And he helps her off with her coat... She's still. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin... 
He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily naked... the young man and the older woman. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Are you sure? 
BENJAMIN Some things you don't ever forget... the feel... the taste... 
And he kisses her again... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) ... the smell... 
He puts his mouth by her cheek... breathing her in...

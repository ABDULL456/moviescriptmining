(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.) 
JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control! ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something? (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! 
(Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.) 
JAFAR:  No!  No! IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the genie, I don't want-- 
(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.) 
ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space. GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you! 
(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) 
JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak out of my face! IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron! JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up! GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out! 
(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) 
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince. JASMINE:    I know why you did. ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.) JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you. GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a prince again. ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom? GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked. ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop pretending to be something I'm not. JASMINE:    I understand. 
(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.)

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. CONTINUOUS 
FITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY. 
FITZY You're fuckin' late. Where the fuck were you? Get in the fuckin' van. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY What the fuck happened?    I came to meet you. 
They start piling into a van. 
INT. THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS 
DETECTIVE 2 is yelling both at his partner and into the mic. 
DETECTIVE 1 Stay in the fucking car. Stay in the fucking car. This is a surveillance unit. (into mic to Colin) Do I pursue. 
INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 1 I'm not sure. 
INT./EXT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR/ THE STREET. CONTINUOUS 
DETECTIVE 1 No pursuit. No pursuit. 
DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D) Fuck that. 
DETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing men, gun drawn. 
FITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1 fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN takes off. 
DETECTIVE 4 Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X to CP. We're being fired upon. I repeat.

He switches off the light and sits in the dark as the afternoon gathers. 
INT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT 
FITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid, guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is dying, on a dirty couch. 
FITZY sits down and looks at Billy. 
FITZY And where the fuck were you? 
BILLY Boss told me to go home. 
FITZY Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. At any rate you weren't fuckin' home. 
BILLY I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh? 
FITZY walks away. 
DELAHUNT (OS) Billy. Billy (Billy goes over to him) 
BILLY (re: his wounds) Jesus Christ. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DELAHUNT Two days...two days ago the Boss says to me, it's been ten years already, and you've never done me wrong. He asked me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him I would but I don't know if I would. Now I know I can't. I've done a lot of bad things but I've never been a murderer. 
BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying. 
DELAHUNT (CONT'D) Hey Billy, I don't want no one to put me in a dumpster. Just don't put me in a dumpster. 
BILLY When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you. 
BILLY lights him a cigarette. 
DELAHUNT You know what I thought today? 
BILLY What's that? 
DELAHUNT Who didn't show up today is the rat. 
BILLY Yeah, so? 
DELAHUNT You never been late in your life. And when I called you... I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you showed up at the right one. 
DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified. 
DELAHUNT (CONT'D) Tell me why I didn't say anything. Tell me why. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him. 
FITZY (drinking) That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop. 
BILLY walks past the table. 
BILLY He's dead. I'm going home. 
BILLY leaves by the front door. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT 
All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage. 
ELLERBY Do you know why Queenan went to that building?

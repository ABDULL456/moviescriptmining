77 EXT. PARKING LOT/ EAST LA - DAY. 77 
The midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang. 
78 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 78 
Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife. 
STANDARD ...I was such a jerk the first time we met. We're at this party and I see the most beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'... (HE LAUGHS) It took me like a minute to get it... 
(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: 78 
Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager to please his dad. 
STANDARD You don't get it either do you, Benicio? Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains. 
He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver. 
IRENE Would you like some more chicken? 
DRIVER Thanks... 
Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food. 
STANDARD Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken. Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant together once I raise the money. That's why she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure out how it's done. She's got more ambition than anyone I know, more smarts too... (He raises his glass) We're gonna drive all those fucking Mexicans out of business - 
IRENE STANDARD - 
STANDARD Excuse my language, Benicio... 
IRENE (Changing the subject) How's the movie going?... 
DRIVER Fine... 
Irene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink. 
IRENE Don't you think that's enough? 
STANDARD Come on, we're celebrating. I've got my family around me and our new friend... 
(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: (2) 78 
He raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on someone his wife clearly admires. 
IRENE Are you working on anything else? 
STANDARD Stop asking the poor guy all these QUESTIONS - 
IRENE (LOSING PATIENCE) Then why don't you go ahead and talk for all of us. 
STANDARD All right, I will. This time next week I'm gonna take you and Benicio away with me... 
Irene stops and looks at him in surprise. 
STANDARD Where you wanna go, Benicio?... 
His quiet confidence concerns her even more. 
BENICIO Disneyland. 
STANDARD Forget Disneyland. I'm gonna take you and your mother away from this bullshit city - 
IRENE Benicio, it's time for bed - 
STANDARD Your papa's got it all figured out - 
IRENE Benicio, you heard me - 
STANDARD It's okay. I'll take him... 
Standard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son. Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver. 
IRENE I'm sorry.

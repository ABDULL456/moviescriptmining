JABIR (after a beat) One million money. Jabir hangs up, ending the call. Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir has just told him. He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it. Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new strategy is necessary. 
He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver. Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tight quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible. After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines the small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball. Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside. He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines from inside. Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin. He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick. Looking into the small box again, he finds several other items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper. He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ransom message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and Arabic. Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored breaths echoing in his palms. 
Under the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up the phone and dials his home. Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is heard on outgoing message. 
SHANE Thanks for calling the Conroy's. We're not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Paul's eyes well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of his son's voice. The Beep is heard. Paul hangs up without leaving a message. He looks at the time. It's 7:02pm. Battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars. He remembers something. 
PAUL Shit. Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul dials Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Dan answers. 
DAN Paul? 
PAUL Here's his number... 
Paul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers dialed and received. 
DAN Hold on. Alright, go ahead. 
PAUL It's 07902-24-921. Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him, and then returns his attention to Paul. 
DAN This is huge. Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes. 
PAUL What about me? Can you track my cell signal? 
DAN We're having a lot of trouble with yours. Seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers. 
PAUL What does that mean? 
DAN That...it's not going to be easy. 
PAUL He wants me to make a ransom video. 
DAN No. Hold off for as long as you can. 
PAUL If it's going to get me out of here, I'm making it. 
DAN The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera. 
PAUL We? Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing him. 
DAN This can't turn into an international incident. 
PAUL That's all you people care about! But what about me? Don't you care about me?

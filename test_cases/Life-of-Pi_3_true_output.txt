Pi scrambles to the storage locker, pulling out the flare gun. He loads and fires - the flare arcs high up into the air, a miniature white star leaving a bright trail of fire and smoke as it falls to the earth. 
LATER - 
139   EXT. RAFT - SUNSET                                          139 
It's grown noticeably darker. The freighter is far off now. 
140   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   140 
It is late now. Pi loads the last flare into his gun and raises it into the air - then stops. The freighter, now a fleck on the horizon, hasn't seen them. Pi watches as the dark form of the boat sinks from view. 
Pi fires one last time, staring up at the archways of smoke and the darkening sky. Pi lowers the flare gun. Richard Parker yawns and turns away. 
PI (WRITING - V.O.) Above all, don't lose hope... 
The flare burns a hole into the night. 
141    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT, MONTHS LATER - DAY                       141 
HIGH ANGLE ("book cover" shot) - looking down on the boat, adrift in the middle of the ocean. Pi lies curled on the tarp in the bow; Richard Parker lies in the stern. Beneath the boat, the ocean swirls with traffic, including an enormous whale shark. It passes beneath the boat, the creature's form blotting out the depths. 
A141   ONBOARD -                                                  A141 
A series of shots to show that Pi has grown gaunt, his eyes wild from exhaustion and endless solitude. The tarp has faded; the paint on the boat has become sun-bleached and weather- beaten. Pi's hair has grown long; his skin has darkened from olive-caramel to cocoa. The shirt has begun to take on a look of thread-worn transparency. 
He taps on the aluminum hull of the boat with his thumb in time with his recitation: 
PI 
EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT 
Richard Parker gazes into the distance;     Pi stares intently at the tiger. 
PI What are you looking at...? Tell me. What do you see? 
The tiger turns and looks over the side of the boat into the water; Pi rises and looks over the side as well, staring into the depths... 
RP'S POV - starting on his own reflection in the water and traveling downward, through schools of darting tuna, squid and lantern fish, past fleeting memories of a storm and zoo animals struggling to survive in churning waters and into the darkest recesses of the sea, Pi finding a broken ship and memories of a former life lying dormant on the ocean floor... 
OUT OF POV - Richard Parker looks over at Pi as he gazes into the water. 
Cut to an extremely wide shot of the boat floating in a sea of stars.

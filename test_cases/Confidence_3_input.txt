CONTINUED: SUITS (cont'd) I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy.'" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark? JAKE Can't say. SUITS Then who's the Banker? JAKE The King. A dead look comes over Suits. SUITS The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all. JAKE I can handle it. SUITS I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame? JAKE It's not history. SUITS So what do you want? JAKE I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. SUITS Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want. Jake considers those words for a moment. JAKE Yes I can. Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods.

CUT TO: INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- CONTINUOUS We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office.           Lily can see that it's thrown Jake a bit. LILY What the hell's his problem? JAKE Don't worry about it. LILY It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry? Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down. JAKE You need to get a haircut. LILY What? JAKE And some new clothes. LILY Why?

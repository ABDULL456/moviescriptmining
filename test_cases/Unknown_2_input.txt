(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check. Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning. 
MARTIN B I'm sorry, it's my fault. Another appointment I forgot. 
BRESSLER It doesn't matter. (jumping back in) But see you, you say I am too cautious. It's an idiot thing to say. I'm a realist! 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME 
Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in another direction. Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over... 
INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME 
Martin B standing. Bressler, collecting his bag and scarf... 
MARTIN B I'm sorry if I offended you, Dr. Bressler. I just -- 
BRESSLER Don't be stupid. You can't offend me. We are colleagues, this is good discussion. But please, Dr. Harris -- Power is an animal, all to itself. It adapts, mutates to whatever form will best preserve it. It's always closer than we know. ON MARTIN B, extending a hand... 
MARTIN B .Perhaps you're right. 
EXT. TIERGARTEN STREET ---SAME 
Gina, crossing the street, searching the restaurant windows, the table empty, busboy gathering up plates. P.O.V. urgently searching. Finds... . Bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi. He's alone. No sign of Martin B. Pulls out her phone... 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME 
Liz, following the winding path lower as it descends. The sound of a cell-phone RING. Liz glances back... .Martin, pressed out of sight against a wall. He SILENCES his phone, tucks it away. 
EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME 
Martin B striding through the park toward the zoo... Gina way behind, trying to catch up. Dials again, Martin's phone going straight to voicemail. 
EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME 
P.O.V. -- LIZ PAUSED AT A GLASS WALL -- GETTING CLOSER Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the rain, silhouetted in front of an underwater view. The giant Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her. LIZ'S FACE. Her eyes, soft. A smile... which fades as she senses a presence. Turns. FACES us. 
MARTIN Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange numbness. Doesn't know where to start... 
MARTIN . Liz. Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense. 
LIZ What are you doing here? 
MARTIN Liz. What's happening? 
LIZ You're crazy -- you have to leave me alone. 
MARTIN Why --?: I have to know why, Liz. Are they making you do this? Are they threatening you? 
LIZ .How did you find me -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN The zoo. The Polar Bears. 
(BEAT) You see? I KNOW YOU, Liz. You KNOW me... Liz's eyes fixed on his. She searches his face. A long beat. Her facade seems suddenly to crumble... 
LIZ I can't... 
MARTIN You can't what? 
LIZ . can't get out. Can't leave. They'll kill me.

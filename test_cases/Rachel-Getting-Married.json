{"train": "RACHEL And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care! \nEMMA Where'd she get the skates from? \nThey collapse in laughter. Kym studies her ass in the mirror. \nKYM I should call her right this second. Is she really coming? Who are all these energetic young people decorating the house? \nEMMA She's got everyone she knows pulling elf duty. \nKYM (squinting at her ass) What about me? What am I doing? Rachel and Emma exchange a look. \nKYM Hello? \nRACHEL Well, I think you'll be assisting on floral detail. I want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom's a little bit tasteful-- \nKYM --Mom's in charge of flowers? \nRACHEL --and I don't want to upset her. \nEMMA (to Kym) And you're such a diplomat. \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                 8 \nKYM I am. I'm like Kofi Annan. In rehab they said I was the maternal hub of my peer group. I was always the referee for softball. \nRachel snorts. \nKYM I was. I was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases. \nEMMA It's softball. Someone was chasing them. \nKYM Whatever. They have trust issues in the first place. I'm going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional love. Kym swans out of the room. \nKYM Anyway, I'm doing some lighting. I already got the candles and everything. Rachel and Emma share a look. \nKYM (CONT'D) Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers. \n9   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.                                9 \nKym crosses the hall to ETHAN'S ROOM and opens the door. \nKYM Speaking of dawgs, when am I going to meet this fiancee of yours anyway? \nRACHEL VOICE OFF He went to get stuff with Kieran. They'll be back. \n10   INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY.                                      10 \nA little boy's bedroom. Pale blue. A single bed, a window, some games. Some stuff in boxes. Not a mausoleum. \nKym enters Ethan's room. She stands there looking around. \nShe takes a moment... \n11   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.                                  11 Kym wandering the upstairs hallway...the winding corridors are a little spooky, despite the openness and light, it feels haunted up here...looking into her old bedroom, seeing Emma's stuff inside. \n12   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.   --LOOKING DOWN--               12 Paul comes to the bottom of the stairs, yelling up. \nPAUL I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas! Who wants what?! \nRachel and Emma shout back down. \nRACHEL It's too hot! \nEMMA I don't eat gluten, Paul! \nPAUL What don't you eat?! \nA DIFFERENT NURSE is waiting by the sinks examining her teeth in the mirror. Kym bangs open the door of her stall with her foot. The door swings back and Kym spills her sample all over herself. \nKYM Piss! \n16   EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER. DAY.                               16 \nAs she runs up the OUTSIDE STAIRCASE Kym wipes at her shirt with a wet paper towel. She yanks open the door and a bird poops on her. \nKYM Shit! \n17   INT. COMMUNITY CENTER MEETING ROOM. DAY.                    17 \nNarcotics Anonymous Meeting. Chairs, light. An ATTRACTIVE GUY is sharing. Kym slams in, frazzled and late. A few people look at her as she grabs a folding chair from a stack leaning against the wall and the other chairs slide to the floor with a huge clatter. \nKYM \nCOCKSUCKER! \nATTRACTIVE GUY Only once. My dealer. I was really broke. The room breaks up. Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen chairs. She is pissed. \nATTRACTIVE GUY Let's see...that was Tuesday... \n18   INT. COMMUNITY CENTER MEETING ROOM. LATER.                  18 \nPASTOR MEL, a guest speaker, shares details of his struggles inside the \"12 Step\" Process. Kym, like everyone present, is riveted. \n19   OMITTED                                                     19 \n20   OMITTED                                                     20 \n21   EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                  21 \nSweaty and fed up with Carol's bike, Kym cycles into the Buchman driveway. Paul has been watching for her out the kitchen window while doing dishes. He waves and yells to his wife. \nPAUL Carol, she's here! \nKYM Where did you think I was? \nPAUL I made you a sandwich, sweetheart! Meatloaf! \nKym's shoulders slump. \nWatching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of milk. There is an awkward exchange of items. Paul hugs and mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead. Rachel opens the window, calls down. \nRACHEL Kymberly! \n22   EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. DAY.                               22 \nFiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN, are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting. Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan. \nRACHEL No. You guys are not getting my design concept. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:                                               22 RACHEL (cont'd) I want every single light to represent a different one night stand during the misspent youth of Kris Kringle before he stopped whoring around and became Santa Claus. \nSIDNEY Oh. I thought you said Satan Claus. \nKIERAN I thought she said Panty Hose. Or Panda Claws. \nEMMA Pandas are endangered. \nRACHEL I know. We're having an endangered Panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture. Or impaling itself on some bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed. Sidney, meet my sister, Kym. \nKYM Oh my god. You're black. (To Rachel) Sorry I called him a dawg. \nRACHEL That's fine. \nRACHEL Because. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                               24 \nKYM What does that mean? \nRACHEL I wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it. \nKym looks sharply at her. \nRACHEL I wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting. \nKYM Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you. Jesus Christ I've been home one day and I can't get a straight answer out of anybody. \nRACHEL What are you talking about? \nKYM I'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds... \nRACHEL Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every ten seconds. \nKYM No. He has to know where I am and what I'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues. \nEMMA That's odd. \nKYM Shut up. \nEMMA Blow me. \nRACHEL Oh, leave Dad alone. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                               24 \nKYM I'd love to but he won't let me. I feel him watching me all the time. And Carol and you guys too. \nEMMA I know I have nothing better to think about. \nKYM Everybody's looking at me like I'm the visiting sociopath. What are you people waiting for me to do? Burn the house down? They both look at her. \nKYM That was a mattress fire and it wasn't even at home! It was on a sleep over! God! I should just get HAZMAT tattooed on my forehead for you people. \nRACHEL Stop! You're like a harpy. Is being my \"Maid of Honor\" this important to you? I didn't think you gave a shit. \nBeat. \nKYM How could you fucking say that to me? \nRACHEL Jesus. Emma! \nEMMA What? \nRACHEL Emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if I asked you to step down as... (exaggerated, practically with quote fingers) ...\"Maid of Honor?\" \nEMMA Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                               24 \nKYM Now Emma's got another reason to hate me. Like she needed one. \nEMMA Is it what you want? \nFor an instant, conflict and pain flicker over Rachel's sweet face. \nRACHEL Not really. \nKIERAN Just kidding. \nKYM I can't believe Mom would be late for my release back into the wild. \nEMMA And here I was thinking tonight was about Rachel! \nSIDNEY Rach, I forgot to tell you, Carol got the helium tanks. \nKYM The words \"Carol\" and \"helium\" somehow... \nRACHEL Aren't there some rules about helium tanks? \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:                                               26 \nKYM (snorting) She wouldn't have any idea what to do with a helium tank. \nSIDNEY Only on public property. I think. \nK? \nKIERAN Huge liability. \nKYM You're a lawyer? \nKIERAN Was. For about five minutes. \nKYM Say something legal. \nKIERAN Tort. \nKYM So what do you do now? \nKIERAN I help Sidney out with the business side of his stuff. \nKYM Sweet. \nRACHEL Here's Mom. The girls clamber up. Kym brushes curry off Rachel's shirt. ABBY, the girl's mom, and ANDREW, her husband, enter the dining room. Abby is a beautiful, wise woman in her fifties. Elegant, ladylike and graceful. Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight. As the girls approach, Abby acknowledges Paul across the room but makes no move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves and tight smiles. \nABBY (to Rachel, embracing) Hello, darling. \nA big hug. She turns to Kym. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:                                                26 \nABBY Kym! Did you get my note? \nThey embrace. Abby steps back but keeps her hands on Kym's shoulders. \nABBY You look beautiful. \nKYM I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat. \nABBY Nonsense. You girls. \nANDREW Hiya Kym. You look great! Hey Rachel! \nHe kisses Kym on the cheek. Rachel gives him a big hug. \nRACHEL Mom, where have you been? Is everything okay? \nKYM Wow. We were wondering if you got the dates scrambled. \nAbby steps towards her daughters, taking them in. \nABBY Yes, everything is absolutely fine now. \nRACHEL I have no memory of that whatsoever. \nEMMA Do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street? \nRACHEL Gotta say no. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                               27 \nEMMA Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror. \nBravos all around. \nEMMA Wait, wait. She actually got the number of one of the E.M.T guys and went out with him. Twice. \nKYM (loudly) Was that the guy with the peroxide hair? Abby, not looking at her daughter, shushes her. \nEMMA Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation. \nRACHEL Mahamoud! Such a nice man. \nEMMA We were driving so fast! It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay. So here's to you, my dear, dear friend. A woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece. Sidney, you are a lucky bastard. \nSIDNEY Hear hear. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                  27 \nRACHEL Where? Where? \nAbby smiles broadly at Rachel and blows her a kiss. \nKym rises with her glass and takes Emma's place on stage. She glows in the candlelight. \nKYM (for the crowd) Relax, it's seltzer. Low giggles. \nKYM (CONT'D) Hello. I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening. I want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though I haven't seen most of you since my latest stretch in the Big House... \nScattered low giggles. \nKYM (CONT'D) You all look fabulous. During the twenty minutes I was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush, I actually did participate in the infamous 12 Step program. 12 Steps. Step-ball- change, step-ball-change. I'm still waiting for the change part. Some guests laugh. Sidney grins. Carol, Paul, Rachel, and Abby sit silently. Andrew moves in towards his wife. \nKYM (CONT'D) But as they say, relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery, God knows I've got high marks in that mode! \nEveryone is staring at Kym. \nKYM (CONT'D) Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                27 \nKYM (CONT'D) So I spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I think, fourteen, but I couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order. \nKym thinks this is hysterical. Paul does not. \nKYM (CONT'D) Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money. (She pauses for a second) Enjoy Hawaii. La Chaim. \nShe lifts her glass and downs it's contents. There is a smattering of applause. \nKYM (CONT'D) (to the group) One down. What's for dessert? \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                               27 \nPAUL Rachel. She just got home. \nRACHEL Again. \nKYM I had no idea you were so angry, doctor. \nRACHEL I'm not. \nPAUL Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. She's uptight about... \nRACHEL I'm not uptight, Dad. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                               30 \nPAUL She's meeting Sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about. \nCAROL Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy. \nPAUL Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just... \nKYM (removing seeds) You people need to purge. You people really should go to Nar-Anon or something. I mean it. \nCAROL Oh my lord. Kym, we have gone through Nar-Anon, baby. You know that. \nRACHEL (turning her head) You people? You mean the people in this room? Your family? \nKYM All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be... \nPAUL (pouncing) Don't even start... \nCAROL (standing next to her husband) Nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, Kym. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                               30 \nKYM Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it. \nPAUL What constant monitoring? \nKYM \"I'll drive you!\" \"Carol, she's back!\" \"Don't sleep here, sleep there.\" \"Here. Eat this.\" Dad, you're obsessed. \nRACHEL Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. \"Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?\" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm. \nPAUL That's unfair, Rachel. And completely untrue. \nRACHEL And she's even worse! \"Dad, you're never going to believe this, but I lost the car again.\" \"Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me.\" \"Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!\" \nKYM Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some paternal/sibling issues to work through. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                               30 \nRACHEL Are you kidding? The two of you are like a double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues. \nPAUL Rachel! It's nice that you're getting your Ph.D-- \nRACHEL (she throws up her hands.) --Oh god-- \nPAUL --but don't be patronizing. It's ugly. It doesn't become you. \nRACHEL How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the \"boundary thing,\" even though I actually know what I'm talking about? \nKYM (waving her arms) Hello? By the way? I'm not in crisis. I haven't been in crisis for a year. \nRACHEL You just got out of rehab! \n30   CONTINUED:                                                30 \nPAUL Kymmie, she's pregnant. She's exhausted. \nKYM Of course. Fair enough. I'm off to raid the medicine cabinet. \nKym is gone. \nSIDNEY She's not serious? \nEveryone gathers around Rachel. \nCAROL Oh, Rachel darling, and Sidney, I couldn't be happier. \nSIDNEY She wasn't serious, was she? \nPAUL Do either of you want anything? A sandwich? You must be hungry. There's cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left over? \nRACHEL No thanks, Dad. I really am pretty sleepy. \nPAUL You're pretty everything! He mushes her face and kisses her cheek. Then he mushes Carol's face. \nCAROL Holy cow. What a day. I think I've aged. I mean it. (To Paul) ) Would you mind if I went to bed, darling? \nPAUL (kissing her again) Of course not. I'll be up, Carol. I'm just going to load the dishwasher. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                                  30 \nSidney intones the opening bars to Paul's heroic \"DISHWASHER THEME\". Paul raises the Cautionary Finger in Sidney's direction. Sidney stops with the music. \nCAROL Let me help, it'll be quicker. \nNow the Cautionary Finger is levelled at Carol. \nPAUL Don't mess with the King. \nCAROL Okay,okay. Hands in the air, Carol leaves the room. \nKIERAN Wow. That's it for me too, you guys. Good night everybody. Kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on Sidney. \nKIERAN Congratulations, man. \nSIDNEY Thanks, my friend. \nKieran leaves. Now it's just Rachel, Paul and Sidney. Paul is beaming like a klieg light. \nRACHEL I've never been so tired in my life. \nPaul gives Rachel a kiss on the cheek and mushes her face some more. \nRACHEL Dad? \nPAUL Yes, sweetheart? \nRACHEL I hope it's okay, I told Mom at dinner. About the baby. \nPAUL Of course, lamb chop. I'm so happy! I'm going to be a grandpa! \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                               30 \nSidney mushes Paul and they attempt a hug and laugh and then they really hug. \nRACHEL I wish Ethan were here. \nPAUL I know, sweetheart. Me too. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                               35 \nRACHEL I'm not exactly sure what that means. \nABBY Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgement. \nRACHEL You think? \nABBY Stop. It can't be easy. Everybody knowing her troubles. \nRACHEL Mom, she's sold syndication rights to her troubles. \nABBY Stop. \nRACHEL Mom, does it bother you at all, Carol doing so much wedding stuff? \nABBY Not at all, darling, I'm thrilled to be providing the flowers. You know how much that means to me. They're going to be exquisite! \nRACHEL Yes, I'm sure, and that's so great and so you, but you can do whatever else you want, you know. I'd love it. \nABBY Thank you, my sweetheart. I just know I'd be one of those wedding mothers who goes completely insane about the hors d'oeuvres. Andrew says I shouldn't be allowed near a shrimp puff. \nRACHEL Huh. \nABBY There are so many other people for you to worry about. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                               35 ABBY (cont'd) Your sister's home and everybody's there and the bride always ends up keeping everybody else satisfied. \nRACHEL You're right. \nABBY But this is going to be the most beautiful wedding ever. And I hope your sister has a wonderful time too...Anyway I'm going to be a grandmother! Hooray! \nRACHEL Hooray! \nABBY I'm so excited. I have always wanted to be a grandmother. Even when I was thirty. Here. This ring was grandma's and she wanted you to have it. \nRACHEL Is she dead? \nABBY Rachel. \nRACHEL It's beautiful. Thanks, Mom. I hope it's a boy. \nABBY As long as it's healthy. Try the ring on. Rachel does. \nABBY You've always had the most beautiful hands. \n36   EXT./INT. SCOTTY'S JAMAICAN RESTAURANT. DAY.              36 \nA neighborhood place, but on the other side of the parkway from the Buchmans' neighborhood. Friendly, bustling, kids on bikes and skateboards, etc. Large windows offer a view of a stop sign, Fanny's Beauty Salon, Soul to Soul Liquor, a barber shop, etc. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                               36 \nThe restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a pinball machine. \nKym and Kieran are playing Foosball at the ancient table where someone has painted Jamaican jerseys on all the players. They are both viciously competitive and genuinely irritated with each other. \nKIERAN Your hand is on the turf. \nKYM What turf? \nKIERAN The turf. The table. \nCAROL Ha! \nSIDNEY You see Paul, I think your problem lies in lid placement. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                               39 SIDNEY (cont'd) Inverting the lids and stacking them in the upper level is really for amateurs. It's passe. \nPAUL Rachel, you're out of the will. \nSIDNEY Observe. \nWith a flourish, Sidney presents a beautifully stacked dishwasher. Paul pats his shoulder somberly. \nPAUL Clean out this machine please, boy. So I can break out the whup-ass. \nScreaming all around. Kym jumps up and down with her arms on Rachel's shoulders. Rachel glances at her sister, laughing. \nSIDNEY/KIERAN (delightedly) He's breakin' out the whup ass! \nA SWEET MONTAGE. \nPaul is loading the dishwasher like a champ. Carol and Emma are smiling and giggling. \nKieran has his eye on the clock. Sidney trash talks from the sidelines. \nSIDNEY You know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize. \nPAUL Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun. \nSIDNEY I find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from Zabar's and retire gracefully. \nPAUL Kieran, how's my time? \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                  39 \nKIERAN You have twenty-five seconds. \nPAUL I need more dishes. You amateur! \nSIDNEY What? No way! \nPAUL Somebody give me some dishes! Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to Paul. He begins to load them. \nCLOSE ON PAUL He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel. \nIt dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl. She is stricken. Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen. \nCLOSE ON KYM -- \nCLOSE ON RACHEL -- She turns and leaves the kitchen. Sidney follows her. Emma and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch.

Kym cranks down the window, tries to light a cigarette. \nKYM Mom is handling the flowers? \nRACHEL Well, she's growing them and choosing them - but they are being delivered by her people. \nKYM Got it. Wow. Nurturing and growing things from the soil. Textbook, right? \nSTYLIST (CONT'D) I can't believe I'm seeing you again. \nKYM (more uncomfortable) I know.

Do you remember that exercise where we all had to write down experiences and pass them anonymously to another person? \nKYM \"The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh Perspective\" Like Secret Santas of despair. \nSTYLIST I got yours. \nKym gives him a quizzical look. \nSTYLIST You drew poodles in the margins. I know it's supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave. The way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your sister's anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing. I'll never forget reading that, I swear to God. \nRachel's stylist is removing her foils while Rachel chokes on her Diet Pepsi and it comes out her nose. Kym looks nervous. \nRACHEL'S STYLIST (to Rachel) Do you want a tissue? \nRachel looks horrified, holding her hand over her nose. \nSTYLIST (To Kym) I found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal. I thank God that you came in here today. I never thought I'd ever have the chance to thank you. It was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around. Rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon. Kym runs after her. Both girls have foils in their hair. \n44   EXT. REAR PARKING LOT/BEAUTY SALON. DAY.                    44 \nRachel is being trailed by her sister through the parking lot. \nKYM Would you stop? \nRachel doesn't stop. She is searching for her keys in the fading daylight. Kym catches up, takes Rachel's arm. \nRACHEL Don't touch me. \nKYM Don't you think his perspective might be a little skewed? \nRACHEL I never had anorexia. You sure as hell didn't watch over me while I was sleeping and WE DON'T HAVE A \nGODDAMNED PEDOPHILE UNCLE!-- \nKYM (interrupting) --That we know of!-- \nRACHEL \n--THAT MADE OUR CHILDHOOD A LIVING \nHELL AND EXPLAINS AWAY ALL OF YOUR SHIT IN ONE FELL SWOOP!...Did you tell them that Dad forced us into a life of prostitution while you were at it? \nKYM Ew!...

She is furious. \nRACHEL I hate her. \nPAUL You don't hate her. \nPAUL It was an accident. \nKYM Yes! I was stoned out of my mind! Jesus Christ, who do I have to be now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up all the love I'm allowed for this lifetime because I killed our little brother? \nPAUL No, it was an accident! \nKYM I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! \nPaul bursts out weeping. \nPAUL It was an accident. Kym, her hair still in foils, rushes out of the house. \nCarol turns to Rachel. Rachel bolts upstairs. Carol turns to Paul. Paul waves her away. Carol is bawling too. \n46   EXT. 7/11 PARKING LOT.

Did she go somewhere? \nPAUL She left the house about an hour ago. \nABBY To a meeting? \nPAUL She and Rachel had an argument. \nABBY Oh, dear. The night before her wedding? What was it about? \nPAUL Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She left the house. She took the car. \nABBY What was the argument about? \nPAUL I don't know.

Well what were they saying? \nPAUL For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to figure out where she went before I call the police! \nABBY Well, last time you called the police looking for her she was upstairs, asleep in the guest room. \nPAUL She wasn't asleep, she was unconscious! And I'm glad I called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done! \nABBY Paul, I'm trying to help. \nPAUL You're trying to dismiss everything! \nABBY She's not a criminal! \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                               50 \nEmma gives Rachel's arm a squeeze. \nEMMA I'll take it. \n51   EXT/INT.

NIGHT.                           53 Abby is in her kitchen preparing tea, dressed in loose- fitting yoga-style PJs, hair still wet from her bath. A door opens behind her and Kym emerges from the bathroom rubbing her hands over her face. \nKYM Ahhh.... \nABBY You should call your father. \nThe air seems to go out of Kym for a moment. \nKYM In a minute. I need a glass of water. \nABBY I've made some tea. \nAbby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into the living room. Trailing behind her, Kym looks around her mother's unfamiliar house -- the spaciousness and stark modernity of Andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the rampant folksy-ness of the Buchman house. \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                 53 \nAbby places the tea service on a low table in front of a sprawling sofa in the stone-walled living room. \nABBY Here darling. Sit down. You look upset. \nKym sits, pours and sips. Abby remains standing and tightens the belt of her bathrobe. \nKYM When will Andrew be back? \nABBY Not too late. He's at a dinner. \nBeat. \nABBY I spoke to grandma today. She sends her love. Is everything all right with the wedding? \nKYM Yes. \nABBY Good. \nKYM Dad was loading the dishwasher... \nABBY Mmm hmmm... \nKYM And I handed him Ethan's bowl with the trains on it by accident. \nKym begins to weep. Abby remains still. Kym's weeping becomes louder and louder. She is having trouble breathing. Just as Abby reaches out to touch her... \nKYM Why did you leave me in charge of him? Abby stops. \n(CONTINUED) \n74A. \n53   CONTINUED:                                             53 \nKYM You knew. All of you knew. People told you. I was a junkie. \n63   EXT. STATION WAGON.

Red lights flashing. \nThe crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably. \nNOW -- The cop gives a clearly upset Kym a Breathalyzer test as PARAMEDICS wrap a pressure cuff around her arm -- she exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between the cop, the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking crowd up on the road. \nTIME CUT -- The paramedic holds Kym firmly by the chin and peers deeply into her right eye. The other paramedic blots at Kym's swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice pack. \nTIME CUT -- The cop gives Kym her license and hands her an official looking form, which she stuffs in her shoulder bag. \n64   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                 64 \nA truck towing the beat-up station wagon comes to a halt in the street in front of the Buchman house. Kym steps down from the passenger seat, ignoring whatever the driver just said in parting. The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS hurrying about. Everything looks absolutely beautiful. CATERERS are running from their vans into the house with armloads of food, drinks, etc. Abby's flowers are being unloaded from another van. Decorative chandeliers are being carried inside. VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a decorated picnic table) at the foot of the driveway. \nKym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the Buchman house, back into the chaos. A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups of coffee, dressed in an Indian military tunic. He takes in Kym's disheveled and bruised appearance. \nVALET Um. Hi. \nKYM I'm the Maid of Honor. \n(CONTINUED) \n64   CONTINUED:                                                 64 \nVALET Cool. \nKym continues her walk toward the house. \nVALET Hey, I know you. I used to work at the dog grooming place. \nKym keeps walking, ignoring him. \nVALET Hey, you holding? \nPaul and Carol, beautifully dressed, appear on the front porch and hurry towards Kym. \nPAUL Kymmie? \nCAROL Oh my lord... \nPAUL Are you all right? They meet at the circular driveway. \nKYM I hit Mom. \nPAUL Oh my god is she... \nKYM Not with the car. \nBeat. \nPAUL \nWe need to get you to a hospital. \nKYM I have to get dressed. \nPAUL Look at you! You need to get to a hospital! \n(CONTINUED) \n64   CONTINUED:                                                 64 \nKYM Dad! I'm fine. \nHe tries to touch her. She stops his hand. Paul backs off. \nPAUL You can't just vanish. You can't just leave. You have to call. You always have to call. \nRachel dabs gently at Kym's face with a washcloth while Kym scrubs at her nails with a brush. \nShe glides the soapy washcloth over Kym's back. She notices the word ethan inscribed within the design of the rose and thorns image tattooed on Kym's left shoulder. \nRachel rinses shampoo and leaves and dirt out of her sister's hair while Kym brushes her teeth. \nRachel dabs makeup on Kym's chin as Kym's hands tremble with the mascara. \nRACHEL I got it. \n69   INT. MASTER BEDROOM.

A canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace to the opened living room doors. Sidney, looking stunning in a dove grey Nehru suit and a lavender pocket square, waits at the altar with groomsmen Kieran, Norman Sklear, and Cousin Joseph (now wearing full dress U.S. Army uniform)... and officiating JUDGE CASTLE. \nSFX: LIVE MUSIC -- \"Here Comes The Bride\" on distant electric guitar and drums plus foreground violin and gently chanted \"Rachel's\" and \"Sidney's\" by the assembled friends.

The wedding guests are slack-jawed. Mrs. Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's passing a stone. \nAbby stands quietly with Andrew in the first row. She looks composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on her chin. The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns to face Rachel and Paul. Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She glows in her white and gold Sari. \nThey reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the beautiful backyard. Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to Emma by reflex. Kym tries to cover her gesture. Rachel and Sidney join hands. \nJUDGE CASTLE We're here on this beautiful day... \nSomebody's baby starts to cry. \nJUDGE CASTLE Exactly. Everybody cracks up, especially Kym. She laughs a beat longer than anybody else. \nKYM (mumbling) Excuse me. \n71   EXT./INT. BUCHMAN BACK TERRACE/LIVING ROOM.

Sidney takes his pocket square and carefully dries her tears. \nAbby is drying her own eyes. \nRachel makes her own declaration to Sidney. Norman Sklear hands Sidney an acoustic guitar and Sidney strums it and plucks a delicate melody. \nSIDNEY For you. (to Rachel's stomach) And you...ahem... (sings) \n\"She used to work in a diner Never saw a woman look finer I used to order just to watch her float across the floor She grew up in a small town Never put her roots down Daddy always kept movin', so she did too. \nYou know it ain't easy You got to hold on She was an unknown legend in her time Now she's dressin' two kids Lookin' for a magic kiss She gets the far-away look in her eyes. \nSomewhere on a desert highway She rides a Harley-Davidson Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind She's been runnin' half her life The chrome and steel she rides Collidin' with the very air she breathes The air she breathes.

La Chaim. \nEVERYONE La Chaim. Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a spoon. \nRACHEL Friends and family, family and friends! I have an announcement to make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked up! Surprised whooping and hollering. \nRACHEL I'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that \neverybody starts dancing. And this means you too, Mom! Abby smiles. SFX: The Deejay spins an infectious platter (TBD). \nRACHEL Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This is my favorite song! \nPAUL Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing. She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor. Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym and goes to sit down with Andrew. Kieran spirits Kym to the patio, where they join the dancers. \n86A. \n74   EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD/OUTSIDE THE TENT.

She stands next to her mother. They are doing their wedding party duties. Neither woman is looking at the other. \nBOB THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR (to Abby indicating Kym) And how is our little wayward girl? \nKYM Fine. (Beat.)

A single candle flickers nearby. \nThe dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence. \nKYM (to Rachel) Hi. Where's Mom? \nRachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed. \nRACHEL Taking a break. \nKYM How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding? \nRACHEL Mom doesn't actually participate in things. \nKYM And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day. \nRACHEL I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets. \nKYM It's so nice here. Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room. \nKIERAN You can run but you can't hide! Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her, dipping her to the floor.

Have you ever thought about Public Relations? \nKYM The public is kind of afraid of me. \nSusanna and Paul laugh. \nPAUL The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here. \nSUSANNA Have you ever thought about P.R. Kym? \nPAUL Logistically it's just a dream. You could stay in your old room. I could chauffeur you around.

It was just beautiful. Bye Kym. She leaves. \nPAUL Suzy's first rate. P.R. can be fascinating. \nKYM You always said it was stupid. \nPAUL I meant stupid. Do you want me to hold that for you?

Are you? \nROSA Walter, you are only responsible for yourself. (To Kym) This is all your stuff? \nKYM You know you never gave me your cell number. \nROSA (sotto) It was a mistake.

Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late 50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym talks rapidly over his shoulder... \nKYM Oh my god. Here you are. I thought you were going to abandon me in rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are half an hour late. I've been standing here with these lunatics. You look so great. Paul offers his hand to Rosa. \nPAUL Hello. I'm Paul Buchman. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                 1 \nROSA I'm Rosa. We met last time you came up. \nPAUL (doesn't remember) Of course, of course. \nKYM Let's go, let's go. Where is everybody? CAROL, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car. \nKYM (loudly) Hey Carol. How are ya? \nCAROL Hello Kym. \n", "test1_true": "CAROL Getting everything ready at the house. \nPAUL There is so much going on at the house I can't tell you. You know your sister's doing all of it herself. \nKYM (eyeing the rearview mirror as she arranges her bangs) My sister is bending the environment to her will? Really? \nPAUL No wedding planners or anything like that. Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends. She is so thrilled you're here. Is that everything, sweetheart? \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                  1 \nKYM (distractedly, rifling through her bag) Yah. Can we go? \nCAROL Is there anyone you want to say goodbye to? \nKYM God no. \n2   EXT./INT. TRANSITIONAL SHOTS. DAY                             2 The station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of New York City on their drive to suburban Connecticut. \nRight away though, Kym lights up a cigarette and Paul and Carol crank their windows. \nKYM So are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house? Because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people... \nPAUL You weren't in a cell, Kym... \nKYM ...AND groups groups GROUPS... \nPAUL ...And nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room... \nKYM ...I was looking forward to a little privacy for once. \nCAROL The only extra person staying at the house is Emma, who's actually been staying in your old room. But she can move, I guess. \nKYM Rachel and Emma. Oh, great. How relaxing. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                                2 KYM (cont'd) The only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than Hannibal! On the eve of a wedding! Nachtmare. \nCAROL Nachtmare? \nPAUL It's a nightmare so bad it's in German. \nKYM Rachel must be totally freaking out. Is she too tense?... \nPAUL She's a wigwam! \nKYM (right on top of him, rifling through her bag again) ...Is she eating? Or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads? Is she hoarding Snickers and Cool Whip under the bed like in high school? She never did put that one to sleep. \nPAUL (genuine) I don't think that that's a problem for her. \nKYM No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. I'm kidding. It'll be great to see her. Foodies are the worst, though. They never get it together. There were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. They would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of \nthem was a guy. I can't wait to see Mom. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                               2 \nPAUL You'll see her and Andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight. \nKYM Can we stop at the 7/11 please? I feel nauseous. I need something to drink. \nCAROL I brought you a Diet Coke. \n", "test1_id": 2826, "test2_input": "She offers the can. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                                  2 \nKYM I prefer Pepsi from the fountain. \n3   EXT. MINI-MART PARKING LOT. DAY.                            3 \nCarol looks at Paul. He is fiddling with the dashboard. \n4   INT. MINI-MART. DAY.                                        4 Kym fills her Big Gulp at the fountain and pays at the counter. The COUNTER GIRL gives her change. \nCOUNTER GIRL I saw you on COPS. Kym appears not to have heard. She pockets her change and leaves. \n5   INT. STATION WAGON. DAY.                                    5 \nAs Paul drives through a bucolic, well-to-do neighborhood featuring a beautiful old church. \n6   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                6 The station wagon pulls into a CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY lined with trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea. There are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in the swimming pool. The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly. \nPaul unloads Kym's bags. \nKYM I'll do it, Dad. \nShe doesn't. \n7   INT. BUCHMAN LIVING ROOM. DAY.                                7 \nKym charges into the house where NORMAN SKLEAR and more friends of Rachel are decorating. They stare at her as she runs up the stairs to the second floor. CAMERA RUNS ALL THE \nWAY UP WITH HER. \nWe hear... \nRACHEL'S VOICE OFF Can we raise this hem half an inch? \nEMMA'S VOICE OFF Yeah, yeah. Here, let me just... \n8   INT. UPSTAIRS. DAY. CONTINUOUS --                             8 \nKym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older sister, RACHEL, trying on her wedding dress with the help of her best friend EMMA. Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an angel in her creamy white and gold sari. Emma has pins in her mouth and a tape measure around her neck. \nKYM Oh my god, you are just mi-nute! \nRACHEL Kymmie! \nEMMA (to Kym) You can't smoke in here-- Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace. Rachel is slightly awkward as Emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from combustion. \nKYM Ow! \nRACHEL I have pins all over me. You look great! \nKYM I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat. All the vending machines. Look at you, missy! I'd swear to god you were puking again! \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                8 \nRACHEL Hah! \nEMMA Kym! \nKYM Emma! (To Rachel) No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and I won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin. \nRACHEL Dad did not say \"blow dealers.\" \nKYM I told him I'd just sleep in Ethan's room. \n", "test2_true": "RACHEL You can always shoot up in the tree house. \nKym laughs. A little too loud. \nEMMA Kym, I'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's Rachel's wedding and this week it's about her. \nKYM Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage! What a relief. \nKym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a moment. Rachel beams back. \nKYM So are you an actual shrink yet? Even though you're like twelve years old? \nEMMA Psychology. Not psychiatry. You know the difference, right? \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                8 \nKYM You should prescribe something soothing for Emma. Like Vicodin. \nRACHEL I will have my PhD. in a year and a half. And psychologists don't get prescription pads, right Kym? \nKYM They do in Guam. \nRACHEL Would you please put that out? Emma designed this dress and there's forty-seven yards of it and I'll go up like the Hindenburg. Kym takes a last drag even though she's down to the filter, then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom. \nKYM (over the flushing toilet) Since when are you a designer, Emma? \nEMMA A while. \nRACHEL She has this great little boutique in Greenwich. She says things like \"you need a fabulous jersey pant.\" \nKYM That's so great. I think I heard that. Isn't this your fifth incarnation or something? Weren't you an actress? All the N.E.D.'s in the hospital were actresses... \nEMMA N.E.D.s? \nRACHEL Non-specified Eating Disorder. \nKYM ...they were constantly doing leg lifts under the sheets. \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                8 \nRACHEL Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding. \nKYM (right on top of her) I ate so much cookie dough and did so many whip-its with Angela Paylin. \nRACHEL I know. And she confessed to you her secret Elvis Stoyko fantasy. I spied on you. \nKYM Oh my god... \nEMMA Elvis Stoyko the figure skater? \nRACHEL In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men's Figure Skating. And Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to \"Could It Be Magic\" for the gold medal. And just when Barry Manilow is singing \"Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast...\" there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz...axel... \nKYM And he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open to the chest... \nRACHEL There is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and Angela takes it! \nKYM To the roar of the crowd and the shock of the Olympic judges! \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                8 KYM (cont'd) And he pulls her out of her chair, undoes her hair, and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song! \n", "test2_id": 2827, "test3_input": "Paul sits heavily. \nRACHEL They're your friends, Dad. \nPAUL They're not my friends. I've just known them my entire life. \nSIDNEY Just so you know, my mother expects to be carried in by liveried servants to the triumphant swirls of the harp and seated on a solid gold throne forged by nuns. \nRACHEL Really? Because right now I have her shoveling kelp in the laundry room. But I have it as a montage. Kieran and Kym arrive on the porch. Kym settles herself on a big comfy chaise. \nKYM Where are you putting me? In the stockade? \nPAUL Kym, stop it. You're at the family table. \nKym turns her face to the sun, shutting her eyes. \nKYM (heedless) Don't put me with Michael and Sandy. \n(CONTINUED) \n53A. \n38   CONTINUED:                                           38 \nRACHEL They're not invited. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                                38 \nKYM Sandy never called me back after I sent her an amends e-mail from Milestones.

With us. \nCLOSE ON SEATING PLACEMENT BOARD-- Paul moves Kym's \"marker\" -- the MONOPOLY DOG -- to the family table. \nWIDER-- \nEMMA Oops. That's nine. I thought you were having tables of eight? \nRACHEL (pointedly) I am. \nKYM (to anyone, her eyes still closed) Where are you putting me? \nRACHEL I was thinking of putting you with Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and need wrangling. \nKYM Can someone else do it? I was planning on enjoying myself. \nRACHEL You're the only one they're afraid of. \nKYM Still? God. \nRachel pushes the MONOPOLY DOG to a different table. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                               38 \nPAUL (not getting it) We can move Grandma Rose and her companion. That's actually a great idea. \nKym opens one eye and sees Paul switch markers -- the MONOPOLY DOG is back at the FAMILY TABLE. Rachel stares at her father. \nKYM That's all I need. Another reason for Grandma Rose to hate me. \nPAUL She doesn't hate you. \nKYM She's still mad about that thing at the Rite Aid. \nPAUL Nonsense! \n", "test3_true": "CLOSE SHOT-- \nRachel moves the Monopoly Dog to another table.

Darling, look, no one's defending any body... \nRACHEL Why are you protecting her? \nPAUL I don't want her to feel like we don't want her. \nRACHEL Sometimes I don't want her. It's my fucking wedding, don't you get it? I want my table to be perfect. Paul kisses her on the forehead. \nPAUL Stop it. She's your sister. \nThey look at each other. The screen door swings open as Emma, Carol, Sidney, Kieran, and Norman Sklear carry the lunch plates to the kitchen. Kym follows, carrying the salt shaker. \nPAUL Okay. Dishes? I'm going to load the dishwasher. \nSIDNEY Paul! Paul, listen, I've been thinking about it.

But you don't know shit about loading a dishwasher. \nSIDNEY Sir, with all due respect, the mantle has passed. \nPaul takes a moment to size Sidney up then spins on his heel to the dishwasher. \nTIME CUT-- Sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load. \nKYM What's the time limit? \nCAROL Two minutes. \nSIDNEY Are you comfortable with that, sir?

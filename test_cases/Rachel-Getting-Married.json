I'm like Kofi Annan. In rehab they said I was the maternal hub of my peer group. I was always the referee for softball. \nRachel snorts. \nKYM I was. I was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases. \nEMMA It's softball. Someone was chasing them. \nKYM Whatever. They have trust issues in the first place. I'm going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional love. Kym swans out of the room. \nKYM Anyway, I'm doing some lighting. I already got the candles and everything. Rachel and Emma share a look. \nKYM (CONT'D) Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers. \n9   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.

And register as a general biohazard. \nPAUL I'll drive you. \nKYM (heading downstairs) Just tell me which car I should take. Paul doesn't say anything. Carol floats to Paul's side. \nKYM Which car? \nPAUL Would you do me a favor, Kymmie...? \nKYM I have a license... \nPAUL You wouldn't believe my insurance. And I'm not... that comfortable.

The girls clamber up. Kym brushes curry off Rachel's shirt. ABBY, the girl's mom, and ANDREW, her husband, enter the dining room. Abby is a beautiful, wise woman in her fifties. Elegant, ladylike and graceful. Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight. As the girls approach, Abby acknowledges Paul across the room but makes no move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves and tight smiles. \nABBY (to Rachel, embracing) Hello, darling. \nA big hug.

He personifies many of life's grandest cliches, even as he breathes fresh life into most of them. He has never, ever \"ceased to amaze me,\" and only in the best of ways. The magnitude of his artistry and his business acumen are matters of public record and delight. He's been a great friend \"through thick and thin,\" and sometimes it's gotten very, very thin -- but he \"stood by me\" at all times, so it is my privilege and honor to stand by him on this profound occasion... TIME CUT -- Emma rises and bangs her glass with her spoon. It shatters. \nRACHEL You're paying for that, Emma. \nEMMA Of course. I'd like to make a toast to the happy couple because I want to come visit them in Hawaii. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n30A. \n27   CONTINUED:                                           27 EMMA (cont'd) Sidney what's the name of that place again? \nSIDNEY Humuu-humuu Nukku-nukuu... \nKIERAN A-Pu-Aa-Aa. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                               27 \nSidney kisses Kieran on the cheek. \nKYM (sharply, to her sister) You're moving to Hawaii? \nRACHEL Sidney's recording studio is there.

I want film!

Do you remember that exercise where we all had to write down experiences and pass them anonymously to another person? \nKYM \"The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh Perspective\" Like Secret Santas of despair. \nSTYLIST I got yours. \nKym gives him a quizzical look. \nSTYLIST You drew poodles in the margins. I know it's supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave. The way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your sister's anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing. I'll never forget reading that, I swear to God. \nRachel's stylist is removing her foils while Rachel chokes on her Diet Pepsi and it comes out her nose. Kym looks nervous. \nRACHEL'S STYLIST (to Rachel) Do you want a tissue? \nRachel looks horrified, holding her hand over her nose. \nSTYLIST (To Kym) I found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal. I thank God that you came in here today. I never thought I'd ever have the chance to thank you. It was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around.

Kym catches up, takes Rachel's arm. \nRACHEL Don't touch me. \nKYM Don't you think his perspective might be a little skewed? \nRACHEL I never had anorexia. You sure as hell didn't watch over me while I was sleeping and WE DON'T HAVE A \nGODDAMNED PEDOPHILE UNCLE!-- \nKYM (interrupting) --That we know of!-- \nRACHEL \n--THAT MADE OUR CHILDHOOD A LIVING \nHELL AND EXPLAINS AWAY ALL OF YOUR SHIT IN ONE FELL SWOOP!...Did you tell them that Dad forced us into a life of prostitution while you were at it? \nKYM Ew!...

Rachel slams the car door shut. \nRACHEL I'm hurt! \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                  44 \nRachel drives off with a screech, leaving her sister standing there. \n45   INT.

It wasn't about you! \nRACHEL Why not? Why wasn't it about me? \nPAUL Rachel... \nRACHEL Dad, stop. (to Kym) Why not? I was hopeful. I was on your side. I still am. Do you have any idea what that means? Do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world? There was nothing left. Everybody was just empty. You think they remembered I was alive or needed anything during your... life? And after all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us! Instead of telling the truth about yourself! \nKYM God, Rachel... \nPAUL Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's this all about? \nRACHEL Apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation. \nCAROL What? \nPAUL Kym, what is your sister saying? Did you say you were sexually molested? \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                               45 \nKYM Oh Jesus Christ. Not by you!

The three on the couch are stunned for a moment. \nRACHEL Dad, look at me. I'm right here. I'm telling you that after Ethan died I wanted her to get better or just die... \nPAUL And look! She is better! \nKYM Nice, Rachel. Thank you. \nRACHEL (to Paul) ...And Dad, she was lying and she didn't give a shit about the rest of us. Recovery can't work if you lie. She knows that. I was worthless to her. We all meant nothing to her. \nKYM You're not worthless. You're my sister. I love you guys. I need you guys, but you don't get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what I'm supposed to be like. You weren't there. You weren't inside my head when I was fucked up and your certainly not there now.

BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up. 
They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY. 
INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width of the alleyway five stories up. 
BATMAN How much do you weigh? 
VICKI ... A hundred and eight? 
He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist. 
BATMAN HANG ON! 
The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR. 
BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. One story; two stories; and then... 
They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS. 
Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS. 
BATMAN (cont.) Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!! 
In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a chance to protest, he LETS GO. 
VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD. 
VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet -- 
-- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull. 
BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off and circle around his prostrate form, still wary. 
The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks. 
They move closer. And stop. 
GOON I ... No blood. 
GOON II Jesus. 
GOON III Wait a minute. 
GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN. 
GOON IV ... What is that? 
GOON III Some kind of body armor. 
GOON I He's human after all. -- Take that mask off. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI 
Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG. 
ANGLE ON GOONS 
peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril. 
GOON I Well?... Who is this guy? 
GOON II I dunno. You seen him before? 
GOON III Maybe he's got some kind of I.D. 
GOON IV Good idea. Let's check his wallet. 
GOON I We'll worry about it later. Plug him. (beat) In the head. 
GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD. 
Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH. 
GOON III Goddam, it's the redhead! 
ON VICKI 
A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING. 
ON BRUCE 
HIS EYES WINK OPEN. 
ON VICKI 
momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 
ON THE THUGS 
No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little. 
GOON II Did you hit her?

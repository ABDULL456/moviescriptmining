ANNIE (stirring, groggy) Is it morning yet? 
JACK No, honey. Go back to sleep. 
She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment looking at her, sadness all over his face. 
JACK (CONTD) Take care of yourself, Annie.  Im going back to the mother ship... 
Finally, he turns to go... 
113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as Jack walks in. 
KATE (looking up from her book) Hey... 
Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed... 
JACK These last weeks, Kate, I know that Ive done some...some unusual things. 
Kate nods. 
KATE Its been interesting, thats for sure. 
JACK But Ive done some good things too, havent I? 
KATE Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing... 
She kisses him on the cheek. 
He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the eyes. 
JACK I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens. 
KATE Are you okay, Jack? 
JACK Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that. 
Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love with him. 
KATE I promise, Jack... 
JACK Promise me again... 
KATE I promise. Come to bed, honey. 
Jack stands up, heading toward the door. 
JACK Soon... 
114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT 
Snow begins to fall... 
Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his mind elsewhere... 
Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open field... 
Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the open field. 
Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out into the field, looking for just the right spot. 
Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in his mouth... 
He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and still...the air clean and crisp... 
He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving in his mouth, watching the dog... 
115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
The room is dark... 
Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed. 
He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad look in his eyes... 
As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own eyelids appear to grow heavy... 
He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes... focusing on her...but its no use... 
Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep sleep... 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE 
DISSOLVE TO: 
116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING 
A PHONE RINGING 
Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto his face ...he stirs... 
THE PHONE STILL RINGING... 
Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one there. 
Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor... 
Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone... 
JACK (groggy, dazed) Yeah...okay, send her up... 
He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes stay closed for another moment...then... 
His eyes open... 
He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor. 
JACK (CONTD) (sadly) Damnit.

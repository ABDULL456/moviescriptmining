HARTMAN A happy ending that's left parents across this country wondering - how can I keep my family safe from abandoned mines? Are there abandoned mines in my backyard? Is my child's school built on top of an abandoned mine? Steve spots Mary, running toward him. 
STEVE No, no, no. 
HARTMAN And how, oh how, can these death traps be avoided? Mary drops right into the abandoned mine.

Rooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand. 
MORTIMER Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon. Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my boy. 
Witherspoon takes Rooney's arm. Rooney pushes him away. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY What is this? 
MORTIMER No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This is... this is Captain Rooney. 
WITHERSPOON The police ?... Oh ! 
The two men shake hands, and Rooney gives the papers to Witherspoon. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take him away, Super. 
Teddy joins them. 
TEDDY I'll be in my office vetoing some bills. 
MORTIMER Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over. 
TEDDY Is this March the four ? MORTIMER Practically. 
TEDDY Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa ! Well, I must get started immediately. 
Teddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives Witherspoon a suspicious look. 
TEDDY Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved out ? 
MORTIMER Who, Mister President ? 
Teddy looks at Witherspoon with a disgusted face. 
TEDDY Taft ! MORTIMER No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa. 
Teddy shakes hands with Witherspoon. 
TEDDY Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my equipment. 
Witherspoon looks at Teddy walking away with a sweet smile. 
WITHERSPOON Happy man. 
Teddy starts going upstairs and he meets Abby and Martha coming down. They're dressed back in their usual clothes. Teddy shakes hands with them. 
TEDDY Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to Africa. Isn't it wonderful ? 
For the last time, Teddy takes out his imaginary sword, points it forward and rushes upstairs. 
TEDDY Charge ! 
He gets into his room and slams the door behind him. Witherspoon looks a bit surprised, and Mortimer holds the hands of the grandfather clock. Abby joins him 
MORTIMER It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it. 
Witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes. WITHERSPOON Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine walks across the churchyard toward the Brewster's house. She is wearing a coat over her nightdress. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Abby and Martha are talking with Witherspoon. 
MARTHA You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ? 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle again. 
Both sisters turn toward Rooney. ABBY Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it. 
MARTHA We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be separated from Teddy. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sorry. 
ABBY Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go. 
ABBY Well, if he's going, we're going, too ! 
MARTHA Yes, you'll have to take us with him. 
Mortimer smiles broadly. 
MORTIMER Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ? 
WITHERSPOON Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy Dale. 
Mortimer comes very close to Witherspoon, and tries, by mime only, to induce Witherspoon to take his aunts. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... MORTIMER (whispering) Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... 
MORTIMER Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine has now reached the Brewster house and opens a window. We hear Lieutenant Rooney's voice. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) Now, let's be sensible, ladies... 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Rooney is talking to the Brewster sisters. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY ...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing, and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar. 
ABBY Our cellar ? 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Yeah. 
Mortimer seems a bit worried. 
MORTIMER Oh-oh !

ANNA That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. 
She's awaiting an answer. 
WILLIAM Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke.  Not often in and out of love.  But... 
He can't really express what he feels. 
WILLIAM ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that? 
ANNA ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you. 
WILLIAM The truth is... 
He feels he must explain. 
WILLIAM ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically. 
ANNA I see. (pause) That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it? 
WILLIAM I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name. 
ANNA Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision. 
Pause. 
ANNA The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. 
Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek. 
ANNA Bye. 
Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him. 
INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY 
The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there. 
WILLIAM What do you think?  Good move? 
HONEY Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there. 
BELLA Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes. 
WILLIAM Tony -- what do you think? 
TONY Never met her, never want to. 
WILLIAM Brilliant.  Max? 
MAX Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian. 
WILLIAM Great.  Excellent.  Thanks. 
Spike enters. 
SPIKE I was called and I came.  What's up? 
HONEY William has just turned down Anna Scott. 
SPIKE You daft prick! 
Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which was on his wall. 
BELLA This painting isn't the original, is it? 
WILLIAM Yes, I think that one may be. 
BERNIE But she said she wanted to go out with you? 
WILLIAM Yes -- sort of...

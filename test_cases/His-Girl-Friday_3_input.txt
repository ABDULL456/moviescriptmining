BURNS What is it? Here! 
She tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies intercepts the throw. 
HARTMAN Gimme that. 
He takes the gun from the deputy. 
CLOSER SHOT 
The Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun. 
HARTMAN (to Hildy) Where'd you get this? 
HILDY I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to. 
HARTMAN Not this gun! 
Burns comes into scene. 
BURNS (easily) I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself. 
HARTMAN Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with! 
REPORTERS AD LIB What? What's that? Etc... 
BURNS (advancing on Sheriff) Are you trying to make me out a liar? 
MURPHY (bitterly at Hildy) It's the last time I ever trust a woman, Hildy. 
SCHWARTZ Maybe Williams was gonna be her best man. 
WILSON That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing your own pals. 
HARTMAN (shoving up to Hildy; trembling) Where is Earl Williams? Where you got him? 
BURNS (sympathetically) You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman. 
HARTMAN I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is. 
HILDY He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer. 
HARTMAN (outraged) What? 
HILDY With a bag of marshmallows. 
The Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns. 
MED. SHOT GROUP AROUND HILDY 
REPORTERS AD LIB Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought we were friends... Etc. (to Sheriff) Look here, Pete! What about Mister Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's he doing over here? 
HARTMAN (grabbing Burns' arm) Speak up! What do you know about this. 
BURNS (gently but firmly disengaging his hand) My dear Hartman! 
He moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains it. 
MURPHY Can that! Where is he? 
BURNS (to Sheriff) The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals. You ought to know that. 
HARTMAN No? Well -- (turning to Hildy) Johnson, you're under arrest. (turning to Burns) You, too, Burns. 
BURNS (calmly) Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing? 
HARTMAN I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this. 
BURNS You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff. 
HARTMAN We'll just start by impounding the Post property. (pointing to Bensinger's desk, addressing Hildy) Is that your desk? 
HILDY (jumping) No! 
BURNS (almost simultaneously) Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here. 
HARTMAN Oh, you do, eh? (to deputies) All right, boys. Confiscate that desk. 
Several of the deputies start toward the desk. 
BURNS (trying to intercept deputies) Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars. 
HARTMAN You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. (to deputies) All right, boys. Take it. 
BURNS I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. (to deputy nearest him) And you'll be an accessory! 
HARTMAN We'll take a chance on that, Burns. (to deputies) Go ahead, boys. (the deputies continue toward the desk) 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT 
Flanked by two policemen, Mrs. Baldwin, dishevelled, with her hat over one ear, is marching toward the Press Room, bound for vengeance. Bruce, considerably upset, is with her. As they reach the door to the Press Room, Mrs. Baldwin stops. 
MRS. BALDWIN You wait outside, Bruce. 
BRUCE But, mother -- 
MRS. BALDWIN (firmly) No! You'll weaken when you see that little Jezebel! I'm going to tell her what I think of her! 
She plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches into the Press Room followed by the two policemen. Bruce remains outside the door. 
INT. PRESS ROOM 
Taking in door as it opens and Mrs. Baldwin, followed by the policemen, comes in. 
HILDY (leaping forward) Mother! 
MRS. BALDWIN (pointing out Burns to the officers) That man there! 
HILDY (hugging Mrs. Baldwin) Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me. 
Mrs. Baldwin indignantly shakes her off. 
HARTMAN What's the idea here? 
POLICEMAN This lady claims she was kidnapped. 
HARTMAN What? 
MRS. BALDWIN They dragged me all the way down the stairs -- 
HARTMAN Just a minute. Did -- did -- (points to Burns) -- this man have anything to do with it? 
MRS. BALDWIN He was the one in charge of everything! He told them to kidnap me! 
BURNS (amazed) Are you referring to me, Madam? 
MRS. BALDWIN You know you did!

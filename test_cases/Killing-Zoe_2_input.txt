ERIC [With her.] 
ASSISTANT MANAGER [Yes.] 
ERIC [That's sweet.] (to Zoey) [You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he one of your clients?] 
He pushes Zoey to the ground. 
ERIC [It's a deal.] 
ASSISTANT MANAGER [Thank you.] 
ERIC [Don't mention it.] 
He grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to the main entrance. 
CLAUDE [Eric!  What are you doing?] 
ERIC [Clearing up the "how full of shit am I" question the cops are asking themselves right now.] 
The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but Eric simply forces him along. 
Everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire from outside.  They all scream. 
Eric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone. 
ERIC (into phone) [Hello.] (pause) [Yes.  I'll hold.] (then to Claude) [I'm holding.] 
After a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end of the line. 
ERIC (into phone) [Hello.] (pause) [You don't know the fucking half of it. So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.] (pause) [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people.  Hear?] (pause) [No.  None of that.  We won't trade. That never works.  Not in the movies, not in real life.  Understand?  We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city.  And you're not going to follow us.] (pause) [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane?  Us?  No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you.  You're really pissing me off.  You think I'm a fucking amature?] 
He covers the mouth piece. 
ERIC (to Claude) [I fucking hate cops.] 
CUT TO: 
INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY 
Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door.  He glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a calculator. 
Then, there is a groaning sound. 
Zed, terrified, spins around. 
Another groaning sound.  The vault security guard isn't dead. His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much alive. 
VAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...] 
Zed can't believe what he's seeing. 
He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind. 
VAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...please hold my...hand.  I don't...want to die...alone.] 
Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it.  He gives it a nudge with his foot. 
The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever. 
Zed kneels down next to the body. 
ZED Are you still there? 
Nothing. 
Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and checks for a pulse. 
Nothing. 
Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches. He has wired a battery to two leads.  He takes out a wire cutter and snips a wire. 
There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks. 
Zed calls to Oliver from the passage. 
INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY 
Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub lobby teller. 
ZED(O.S.) (distant, calling from the vault) Oliver, now!  Open the vault!

CEO TED NORTON Spare me, Ken, you were just trying to inflate your share price! 
CEO KEN KINKABE This merger is over! I will see you in court! 
CEO TED NORTON Not if we see you first, you prick! The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared. The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to coax them back to the table. Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit.. .until Flemming Steel III grabs his arm, furious. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Right now you need to give me one reason not to fire you. Mitch stammers, oh shit. 
MITCH Relax, dude ... this-this is all part of my master plan. 
FLEMMING STEEL III It is. 
MITCH Yes! Check it out: if we drag this out...we make more money, right? Don't we? Of course we do! And then we can bill the fuck out of them! Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what I'm saying? 
FLEMMING STEEL III That's your plan. 
MITCH Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very good plan, is it. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Son, what you've just said to me is highly illegal. You could go to jail for a very long time just for suggesting it... 
MITCH 
(SWEATING) We're lawyers! We're above the law! 
FLEMMING STEEL III I must say, I've never seen this side of you before, Lockwood. I always thought you were on the straight and narrow... 
MITCH Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up gangster all the way through. Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't breathe. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Fine, I'll roll the dice with you But if word of this gets out, I will throw you under the bus so darn fast you won't know what hit you. Now go put on some proper clothes. You look like Joe Pesci. Flemming Steel III hurries off. Mitch exhales, holy shit... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VAN NUYS -- RANCH HOUSE -- DAY 
Dave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero, reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about. Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A. 
DAVE Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the fuck is Hair & Makeup? 
P.A. 
(POINTING) Um, trailer 3.. ? 
DAVE That's so real. Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out. 
INT. HAIR & MAKEUP TRAILER -- DAY 
Dave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his shirt undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled. He studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in. 
P.A. I'm here to take you to set. Is there anything I can get you? Vitamin water, Pelegrino? 
DAVE No thanks. Hey, what does it mean when it says T.S., or B.T.S.? 
P.A. Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot. 
(TO HEADSET) Steve Action is coming to set. Dave, alarmed, follows the P.A. out and 
THROUGH THE LOW BUDGET SET They've taken over this valley ranch house; cables, lights and sound equipment run everywhere. 
DAVE Wait! W-what kind of movie is this?! 
P.A. It's a lorno. 
DAVE I-I'm not familiar with that genre. 
P.A. Lorno? Light porno? Tits & shadows? You ever hear of Skinemax? 
DAVE Oh no. They arrive in 
AN ORNATE BEDROOM bedecked with cameras, grip equipment -- and thousands of lit candles. The P.A. unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil. Just then, the fat balding director, VALTAN -- just Valtan -- from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in. 
VALTAN More oil! Make him shiny like fish! 
DAVE Excuse me, are you in charge here? I think there's been some sort of

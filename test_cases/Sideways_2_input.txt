UNDER THE STUDIO LOGO: 
KNOCKING at a door and distant dog BARKING. 
NOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD -- 
SATURDAY 
The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent. Then we hear someone get out of bed. 
MILES (O.S.) ...the fuck... 
A DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, say, a hangover. 
A WORKER is there. 
MILES (O.S.) Yeah? 
WORKER Hi, Miles. Can you move your car, please? 
MILES (O.S.) Why? 
WORKER The painters got to put the truck in, and you didn't park too good. 
MILES (O.S.) (a sigh, then --) Yeah, hold on. 
He closes the door with a SLAM. 
EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE -- 
SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA 
Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work. 
He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car starts fitfully. 
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot. 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and soon NODS OFF. 
INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking just past camera. 
MILES Fuck! 
WHIP PAN TO -- 
THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50. 
ON THE PHONE -- 
Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase. 
MILES Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there by noon, but there's been all this work going on at my building, and it's like a total nightmare, and I had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm out the door right this second. It's going to be great. Yeah. Bye. 
INT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY 
ON THE TOILET -- 
Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page, lost in his reading. 
LATER -- 
Miles SHOWERS. 
IN THE MIRROR -- 
Miles FLOSSES. 
INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY 
Miles finally makes it to the front of the line. 
BARISTA Hey, Miles. 
MILES Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please. 
BARISTA Rough night, huh? (ringing it up) For here? 
MILES No, I'm running late. Make it to go. And give me a New York Times and... (scanning the display case) ...a spinach croissant.

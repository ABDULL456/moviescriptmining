LEON Now, please, Swana. 
SWANA (to the Official) Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted. 
LEON (bitterly) That does it, Swana. (he leads her toward the door) Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser. 
SWANA (stopping at the door) Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch√¢teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change... 
LEON Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious. 
His words are unmistakably a final dismissal. She walks out. Leon looks after her for a second, then goes back to the Official. He tries to laugh off the incident. 
LEON She must have her little joke. (the Official responds with a stony look) You're not going to take that seriously. 
OFFICIAL The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement? 
LEON Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't! 
OFFICIAL But you had! 
LEON Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow. 
OFFICIAL I think so too. 
LEON I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl. 
OFFICIAL So it's love which drags you to Moscow. 
LEON Yes! 
OFFICIAL No visa. 
LEON (fighting for his point) I must get into that country of yours! 
OFFICIAL Oh no. No visa. 
LEON (more aggressively) That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa... 
OFFICIAL (ironically) You're going to force us... huh? 
LEON (growing violent) Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out! 
OFFICIAL Why should I take a chance? 
LEON On what? 
OFFICIAL How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory? 
LEON What for... why? 
OFFICIAL Or a tunnel or a bridge... 
LEON Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country.... 
The Official laughs in a superior way. 
LEON I'll boycott you, that's what I'm going to do!... No more vodka... no more caviar... no more Tchaikovsky... no more borscht.... Wait a minute, I know something better than that... 
The Official leans forward sarcastically. 
OFFICIAL What? 
With a knock-out blow, Leon sends him to the floor, then, leaning over the counter, he shouts. 
LEON And you can tell the Kremlin that's just the beginning! 
He strides out. 
The Official's head emerges from the counter. As he adjusts his bruised jaw, he speaks. 
OFFICIAL No visa. 
Establishing Shot of Russia -- First of May -- Stock Shot of May Day Parade on the Red Square 
FADE IN ON: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
RADIO ANNOUNCER 
RADIO ANNOUNCER March, march, march! Comrades of the World, never has there been such a May Day parade as this! Already for four hours the pavements of Moscow have resounded to the tread of a million boots! Thousands of gun- carriages have thundered past. Thousands of tanks, combined with our mighty air force, have demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor that we are ready and invincible! Now past me marches the great army of our civilians! Men and women of all ages. All servants of the State united in one thought and ideal. Group of Several Units Marching 
Workmen, soldiers, tanks, airplanes, etc. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Column of Women, dressed in typical Russian May Day parade fashion, marching and saluting. The CAMERA NARROWS DOWN to a CLOSE SHOT OF Ninotchka marching with the others. All her individuality is gone. She is one of many, a cog in the Russian machine. With a stern expression she is looking straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention and she glances to one side. 
A Column of Male Workers is coming in the opposite direction. Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are recognizable among them.

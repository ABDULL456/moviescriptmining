Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock. 
SHE FLOATS. 
Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove. 
And then the other. 
Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half. 
Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit. 
Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air, relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds her. 
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position. For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber, surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in the cabin's womb. 
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
SILENCE. 
The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite universe stretching out beyond. 
The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below. 
Everything is still. 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ZVEZDA MODULE. 
The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small eating area and a small gym. A HUM reverberates across the station. 
At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading INTO THE- 
UNITY NODE 1. 
A spherical space with three hatches, each leading into different modules. 
A HATCH OPENS and- 
Ryan floats in. She stops at the center and holds onto a handle. 
She looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards THE- 
ZARYA MODULE. 
There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls. Clothes, shoes, a strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in chaos around the module. 
It's clear that someone left in a hurry. 
Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet on the wall. She OPENS drawers, looking for something. 
RYAN Come on, come on. 
She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it. 
She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows. They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes. 
She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag. 
She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting down. 
She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the- 
UNITY NODE 2- 
RYAN (CONT'D) OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! 
Without stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into THE- 
ZVEZDA MODULE. 
The walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires. Without slowing down her momentum, she floats to the- 
MAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the communication and navigational systems. 
On the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which Earth is clearly seen. 
She begins to PUSH BUTTONS. 
COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications headset. 
STATIC CRACKLES. 
RYAN Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits.

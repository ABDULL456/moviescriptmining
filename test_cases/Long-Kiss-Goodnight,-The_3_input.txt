DAEDALUS Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot you in the head. Nice and quick. Otherwise, you're in for a long night. *Who did you talk to*? 
SAMANTHA ...Nobody... fuck you... 
He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch. 
DAEDALUS Hate to see you like this, Charly. I heard you were a helluva spy once. 
Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice, not her own: 
SAMANTHA Watch your back. I'm not done yet. 
DAEDALUS That's a very funny joke. You're an entertaining woman. Good night. 
He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads. 
UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan, mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In a flood. Stark and vivid. 
MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR 
THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky. Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals -- 
There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the trunk. Nods. 
TIMOTHY Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting, and Jack...? Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, try to play doctor first. I made that mistake. 
The lid SLAMS SHUT. 
BACK UNDER THE WATER 
The world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster and faster -- 
MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness. Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA) is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched. 
ONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt. 
Her eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE -- 
Then she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car... Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots her. In the head. 
She pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller -- 
INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT 
Here. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath. SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD -- 
By her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half frozen. 
DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine, watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile. 
CHARLY Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let me go now...? I'll leave you the use of your legs... Bargain, trust me... 
Daedalus struggles to recover his poise. 
DAEDALUS How did you find me? Who knows about this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD? 
Charly's eyes bore into his: 
CHARLY I let you touch me, cowboy... I think I need a bath. 
Daedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time. 
UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME 
Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN. Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now there's RAGE. 
It takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist... But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME. 
She darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS -- 
Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr. Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage inside her. Death in her hands. 
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE 
The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing. 
The first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel. Incredible. 
Doesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen, REBORN, from the icy waters. 
DAEDALUS Samantha... Please...! 
CHARLY Who's Samantha? 
She shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says:

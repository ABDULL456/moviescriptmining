He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place. 
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT 
In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above his head. 
EXT. ROAD. DAWN 
The van is silhouetted against a rising sun. 
INT. BACK OF THE VAN. DAWN 
The tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van. 
INT. VAN. DAWN 
David is driving. Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from him. David seems quite at ease. 
A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes them. 
INT. LOFT. DAY 
David sits still in the darkness. 
INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY 
Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts it fractionally and replaces it. 
INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY 
Hunched over a VDU, the Salesman is offering Juliet a range of flights. 
SALESMAN October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five. 
JULIET That sounds fine. 
SALESMAN Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important? 
JULIET What? 
SALESMAN Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you. 
JULIET Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct. 
SALESMAN It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.

The hall is empty but we can hear David's footsteps on the beams above.

MENENIUS On both sides more respect! 
SICINIUS (calling to the crowd) Here's he that would take from you all your power! The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the restraint of the police. We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight. The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and building the fever: 
BRUTUS You are at point to lose your liberties! Martius would have all from you, Martius, Whom late you have named for Consul. 
SICINIUS What is the city but the people?! 
TAMORA True! The people are the city! 
SICINIUS We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people, Martius is worthy of present DEATH! A huge roar from the mob. Panic and violence building. Fast 
AND OVERLAPPING: 
BRUTUS Guards, seize him! 
CORIOLANUS No, I'll die here! 
BRUTUS Lay hands upon him! 
SICINIUS (to the crowd) 
HELP, YE CITIZENS! At his cue-- The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of this story finally EXPLODES-- 
With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks 
THE POLICE-- Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and 
TRUNCHEONS-- The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed with clubs and knives, others snatch up garbage cans and newspaper vending machines, throwing them, smashing windows, battling the police, kicking and punching and screaming-- It is civil disobedience. But it is also drunken, thug violence. Terrifying in its intensity-- Menenius gets Titus and Cominius to hustle Coriolanus away-- 
MENENIUS Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away! All will be naught else-- 
COMINIUS Come, sir, along with us-- They hurry Coriolanus away-- The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the 
CROWD-- 
SCREAMS-- TV news crew filming-- Chaotic, flurried violence-- Shaky TV images, cell phone video-- Choking, acrid gas-- It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order breaks down. Rome is bloody. 
INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DUSK 
Menenius and the Tribunes are gathered in a darkened office for some high-stakes politicking. Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too some supporters on either side. 
MENENIUS 
(URGENTLY) As I do know the Consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults-- 
SICINIUS Consul! What Consul? 
MENENIUS The Consul Coriolanus. 
BRUTUS He Consul?! 
SICINIUS It is decreed He dies tonight.

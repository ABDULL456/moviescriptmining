He gets up and walks off to the bar. Rachel stares after him. Stephan watches her. 
STEPHAN Forget about it. 
RACHEL Forget about what? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   34. 
STEPHAN I've spent two years with him, and I don't know him. Nobody knows him. He's alone. 
Rachel thinks this over. 
RACHEL What about family? 
Stephan stares at her. She realises what this means. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) All of them? 
STEPHAN (O.S.) All of them. 
He looks over at David standing at the bar. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Maybe it's not always a blessing to survive. 
76     EXT. STREET/PARK - DAY                                        76 
A tram passes, revealing Stephan walking across the scrubby, desolate park, jingling car keys in his hand. 
Suddenly he drops them. He's about to pick them up when a man dips down and hands them back to him. 
We recognize the moment. STEPHAN Vielen dank! 
SMARTLY DRESSED MAN Bitte sehr. 
Stephan walks on. In his hand he is now holding a small METAL TUBE. 
76A    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM. CLINIC - DAY.                         76A 
From Rachel's POV we are watching Vogel as he prepares his instruments. 
She has come for her second examination. 
VOGEL This is my hand. This is the speculum. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   35. 
Rachel flinches as she feels the speculum. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) How did you find me? 
RACHEL (beat) What? 
VOGEL Who told you about me? 
RACHEL Who... told us? 
VOGEL Were you referred by a doctor, or...? 
RACHEL (trying to conceal her relief) Oh, Doctor Eisenberg. 
VOGEL Ah-ha. How is the old Jew? 
RACHEL Very good. 
Vogel busies himself for a moment. 
VOGEL Any history of infertility in your family Frau Roget? RACHEL No. 
VOGEL Are your periods irregular? 
Rachel stares up at the light. 
RACHEL Yes. 
VOGEL Yes. I think we've found the problem. 
Rachel stares at him - she didn't know there was a problem. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) It's very common. Your ovarian follicles...well, inside you're still immature. (MORE) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   36. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) We need to help you with this. There's something we can use, a little injection. Do you want to proceed? 
Rachel nods, dumbly. Vogel nods, turns back to his tray of instruments, begins preparing an injection. 
Vogel turns back to her with the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Instinctively Rachel stiffens. He injects her. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) (As he works) How many brothers and sisters do you have? 
RACHEL (Stiff) None. 
VOGEL An only child? 
Rachel nods. Vogel smiles, not unkindly.

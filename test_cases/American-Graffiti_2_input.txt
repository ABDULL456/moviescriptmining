BOBBIE Do you know Kip? 
CURT Huh? Yeah, I know him. 
BOBBIE Talk to him when we go by. 
CURT What do you want me to say? 
BOBBIE Anything... I just want to meet him. 
They pull up next to Kip's car and Curt leans forward and yells out Bobbie's window. 
CURT Kip, baby, what's up? 
KIP Henderson, long time no see. Whadaya been doing? 
CURT Not much, just wanted to let you know that Bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps... 
Bobbie swerves the car away and turns a corner. She stops on a dime at the curb. 
BOBBIE You creep, fink, son-of-a-bitch-- 
She turns and starts flailing at Curt with her purse. 
CURT Help, wait! Joke--Joke--Bobbie, remember your nose bleeds! 
BOBBIE Get out--get out of my car--I hate you! 
CURT Excuse me--ouch--Wendy--I got to go now. 
Wendy is laughing and Curt climbs over her out of the small car. He gets out and closes the door. Wendy changes seats and looks at him seriously. 
WENDY Curt, I hope I see you at registration. Call me if you want. It was nice seeing you again. 
CURT See ya. 
The car pulls off and Curt watches it. Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street. 
CURT Oh shit--there!! Wait! 
The VW's gone and Curt starts after the T-bird on foot. He runs down the middle of the street, oblivious to the horns honking and the cars swerving to miss him. 
We move with Curt as he moves like a broken field runner through the traffic only to finally lose the girl and the Thunderbird and to slow and finally stop, standing on the white line. Cars slow down and kids rubberneck as they go by him. 
CRUISING G STREET--'32 YELLOW DEUCE COUPE 
John is driving and the Wolfman is howling on the radio while Carol is having the time of her life. 
WOLFMAN (V.O.) Went to a dance lookin' for romance. Found Barbara Ann... baby... Hey, this one is for all you out there watchin' the Submarine Races. 
And the radio moans into "Who Wrote the Book of Love." Carol sits with her feet up against the dash. John knocks them off and she scowls at him. 
CAROL I'm so thirsty, I could die. Just a little 10 cent coke to wet my whistle. It won't take a minute, I can drink it in the-- 
John suddenly hits the brakes and Carol almost hits the floor. John reaches over and opens the door. 
JOHN Why don't you just get out and get one then! So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago. 
She stares at him, shaken, looking sweet and helpless. He turns and looks at her. A tear rolls down her cheek slowly. John can't take it. 
JOHN All right, one coke and then home. 
Carol is delighted. She slams the door. John takes off. 
CAROL Isn't it great, the way I can cry whenever I want. A lot of people can't do that, but Vicki showed me how. I bet you can't cry. 
JOHN Don't count on it. I may surprise you any minute now. 
MEL'S DRIVE-IN 
John cruises around the lot until he finds a space among the rows of dazzling cars. He pulls in and leans out to hit the intercom button. 
JOHN (into intercom) One ten cent coke. Is ice extra? All right, ice. 
CAROL Thanks for nothing. 
She looks around, sitting up so maybe some of her friends will see her in John's neat car. 
CAROL Oh rats, I though some of my friends might be here. 
JOHN Probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime. 
CAROL Wait, there's Dee Dee. I hope she sees me.

Now we can see the terror in Winter's eyes. 
PINHEAD It just might come true. 
Winter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains. Pinhead turns his attention to the DEADERS. 
PINHEAD This world, it obviously disappoints you all. Perhaps that's why you choose to begin this journey. And as long as you so willingly accepted, allow me to finish off what he started. 
And out of the darkness an oversized MENACING CHAIN comes FLYING OUT, HARPOONING straight through the midsections of all the deaders lined on the right side of Amy. Piercing 
them at all different levels. 
Then another chain HARPOONS the Deaders on the left side. The Deaders look like fish on a stringer. They dangle there, suspended by the chains. 
PINHEAD (to Amy) And as for you. You opened the box, you brought us all together. You chose wisely. I'm pleased. 
AMY I didn't want any of this. They used me to open the box. I didn't choose to do anything. Amy looks to Marla, she's got the fear of god in her. Pinhead sees Amy looking for help. 
PINHEAD She's one of us now Amy. Now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure. To a world where suffering is taken to higher level. 
AMY Please. 
PINHEAD You opened the box. 
AMY I didn't mean to. I only wanted the truth. 
PINHEAD And now you have it. But knowledge comes with a price -- and it's time to pay. 
AMY What about them? 
We see the CENOBITES now with snake-like tongues working their way up the line of Deaders towards Amy. They're preparing each one as they pass. Poking them with large pins, piercing them, stitching them, filleting them, etc... 
PINHEAD They belong to me now. They offered themselves willingly through him to me -- And now it's time for you to do the same. 
Amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at Pinhead. 
PINHEAD It won't be that easy this time. But yes, your Father is with us too. And he's waiting for you. 
These words pierce through Amy. She looks at Marla, now barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness. Her head lifts up to Amy. 
ARLA You're here to stop this Amy. He needs your soul willingly. Don't let him take you. Don't go willingly. 
Marla looks at the knife. Amy gets it, she only has one way out. Marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes. 
MARLA Its over. Winter is gone. You can't come back. You won't become a Deader...or one of them. 
Marla looks to Pinhead, then back to Amy. They both know what she has to do. 
MARLA (her final words) Only he can bring you back. 
Amy sees the meat hanging off the chains. It used to be Winter. She glares at Pinhead with a sudden look of confidence, like a light bulb has gone off and she can finally see her way out. She raises the knife high in front of her. 
The two SNAKE-TONGUED CENOBITES move in closer to Amy. They can't wait to have a little taste. 
For a moment, Pinhead is pleased, then Amy begins the DEADER CHANT, but reverses its meaning. 
AMY                               PINHEAD My skin IS real. My eyes ARE       It's too late to save real. My muscles are real. My      yourself. Your soul is mine bones, my heart, my veins and      and mine alone. Your Father nerves, and flesh and meat...      is waiting for you. He misses are real. What I see, what I       you so much. hear, what I taste, what I            (louder) touch, what I remember, what       The only way out Amy Klein -- I think, what I feel, is           is THROUGH ME. real. 
The Cenobites freeze for a beat and turn to Pinhead. They haven't seen that before.

FADE IN: 
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- NIGHT 
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI CAB breaks free and glides to the curb in front of Elysium. 
Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a little too loudly. Wills seems stiff and tentative, a shadow of his former self. 
INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS 
AN ELDERLY COUPLE passes them as they enter. Wills stops at the coat check and helps Patty with her coat. She admires the decor -- 
PATTY Oh, Wills, it's beautiful! 
Although his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial -- 
WILLS Thank you. It was designed by a team from -- 
PATTY So functional! Is that stainless steel? 
WILLS Actually, no, it's velvet. 
She furrows her brow, squints, then laughs. 
PATTY Oh, my God, it is! 
Wills hands Patty's coat to Melissa, the hat check girl, and asks under his breath -- 
WILLS How are you? 
Looking at Patty, Melissa asks with deep sympathy -- 
MELISSA How are you, sir? 
Before Wills can respond, Patty takes his arm -- 
PATTY Well, if the food's even half as good as the moldings I'm in for a very special treat. 
Jesus is surprised to see that Wills is not with Charlotte -- 
JESUS Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us? 
WILLS Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's available. 
JESUS Certainly, sir. 
Celia approaches, equally surprised not to see Charlotte -- 
WILLS Hello, Celia. 
CELIA (sincerely) How are you this evening, sir? 
WILLS I've been worse. 
CELIA (under her breath) Are you sure? 
The NEW HOSTESS, Celia's replacement, arrives. 
JESUS Table Seven. 
NEW HOSTESS This way, please. 
WILLS (to Patty) Order a drink. I'll be right with you. 
Patty follows Celia. Wills moves to the reservation stand where John stands, stone-faced, flipping through the reservation book -- 
JOHN Where the hell you been? 
WILLS Splendid, how are you? 
JOHN Where's Charlotte? 
WILLS Deliveries on time? 
JOHN Who's the broad? She looks like a Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio. 
WILLS Keep up the good work! 
Wills walks away. 
INT. DOWNTOWN BAR -- NIGHT 
Dark, smoky, and boisterous. FIND CHARLOTTE, standing with Simon. She looks around disgustedly and shouts above the roar -- 
CHARLOTTE Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now why is this so good for me again?! 
SIMON That's just it! The great spiritual benefit in leaving one's room is that it reminds one of how odious it is to leave one's room!

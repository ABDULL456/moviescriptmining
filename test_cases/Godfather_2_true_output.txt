MICHAEL Then Luca turned to the other man... 
KAY Michael, I love you. 
MICHAEL ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. 
The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story. 
KAY I never know when you're telling me the truth. 
MICHAEL I told you you wouldn't like him. 
KAY He's coming over here! 
LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table. 
MICHAEL Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. 
KAY (having survived LUCA) How do you do. 
MICHAEL My brother, Tom Hagen. 
HAGEN Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business. (privately) He's been asking for you. 
MICHAEL Thanks Tom. 
HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following. 
KAY If he's your brother, why does he have a different name? 
MICHAEL My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer. 
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) 
DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the YOUNG COUPLE. 
LUCA (O.S.) Don Corleone... 
THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech. 
LUCA (with difficulty) Don Corleone...I am honored, and grateful...that you invited me to your home...on the wedding day of your...daughter. May their first child...be a masculine child.  I pledge my never ending loyalty. (he offers the envelope) For your daughter's bridal purse. 
DON CORLEONE Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. 
THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful. 
LUCA Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I know you are busy. 
He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN. 
DON CORLEONE I'm sure it's the most generous gift today. 
HAGEN The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo. 
DON CORLEONE is not pleased. 
HAGEN The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin.  Also he has access to this country.  He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law.  For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action.  They call Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids.  He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger.  Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint.  Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. 
THE DON nods. 
HAGEN He's his own boss, and very competent. 
DON CORLEONE And with prison record. 
HAGEN Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify. 
DON CORLEONE When did he call? 
HAGEN This morning. 
DON CORLEONE On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait. 
We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style. 
DON CORLEONE What that?  It sounds like Johnny. 
He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light. 
DON CORLEONE It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding. 
HAGEN Should I bring him in. 
DON CORLEONE No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson. 
HAGEN It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again. 
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) 
JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding GUESTS. 
KAY I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane. 
MICHAEL Sure. 
KAY I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off. 
MICHAEL He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. 
JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight. They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

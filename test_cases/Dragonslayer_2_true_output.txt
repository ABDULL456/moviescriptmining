CUT TO: 
DUNGEON 
Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred door shut. The young sorcerer waits until they're safely out of sight, then takes out his amulet. He ponders it for a doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips it off his neck and out through the bars. 
TYRIAN Thank you. 
He makes an ironic salute and leaves. Galen sits down heavily and stares at the stone walls. 
CORRIDOR 
Unseen by Galen, a figure clad in silk and lace skitters down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner. Stealing a look at Galen is the Princess Elspeth, a fey beauty in her early twenties. After a moment, spooked by some imagined noise, she flits away. 
CUT TO: 
DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY 
Dark clouds slide across a pale sun, throwing the ruined land below into shadow. Soon fat droplets of rain are splattering on the rocks above the dragon's lair. With each tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam. These rocks are hot!

DUNGEON 
Outside the barred window, a steady rain is falling. Inside, Galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on the floor of his cell. He marks runic signs on the window sill and lintel.

Startled, Galen whirls around to find Elspeth standing outside his cell. She hands some food and blankets through the bars. 
ELSPETH I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me appelo Elspeth, filia regis. 
Galen looks her over. He's never seen anyone so angelic. 
GALEN How do you do. 
ELSPETH Please don't think ill of us. My father is a wonderful man, a wise man. The lottery was his idea. 
GALEN I see. 
ELSPETH You don't understand. From the moment it began, the dragon was tame. The kingdom prospered. 
GALEN And only a few had to be sacrificed. 
ELSPETH Yes, that's true. Isn't it better that a few should die that many might live? 
GALEN Depends on who does the dying. 
ELSPETH Oh, but we all take our chances. My father is a just man. My name is entered on the lists, along with every other young --

Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis of Davidov's voice... 
DAVIDOV (V.O.) I'm running late...no, no, I'll make it...how will they know I'm your man?...romashka...romashka...alright. 
Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system activates in his WINDSCREEN... 
He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK. 
He goes back inside. 
BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the lock on the trunk.  It pops open. 
Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside: 
A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD EYES. 
Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket. 
It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it. 
AT THE OFFICE 
Davidov is coming out... 
Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car. 
AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE 
Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then... 
HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear... 
THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever was. 
Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT 
The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared airstrip. 
INT. CAR 
Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded area. 
EXT. CAR 
Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk. 
He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but something is different, the clothes not quite right and then: 
THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps... 
It IS JAMES BOND. 
BOND Problem, comrade? 
Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles, dead. 
Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov. 
BOND Old habits die hard. 
He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He opens the lock. 
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags -- and a polaroid-type camera. 
He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in 'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass. 
Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but... 
A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP. 
HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees, flying low, its red landing lights blinking. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT 
A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits in the doorway. 
BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking into. 
BOND Here goes nothing. 
He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to the plane.  He starts up the steps: 
THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him IN RUSSIAN. 
Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says: 
BOND Romashka. 
The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon. 
INT. PLANE 
Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a big, thick-necked tough. 
They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY. 
The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that sounds like..."where's the rest?"

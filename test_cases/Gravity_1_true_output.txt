RYAN How did you get here? 
MATT Ryan, you have to learn to let go ... Hey? 
Ryan is almost sound asleep. 
RYAN What? 
Ryan is asleep. 
MATT It's time to go home. 
Her eyes snap open. 
Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back. 
CLICK CLICK CLICK. 
Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking, making a percussive sound. 
A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that has frozen on the glass. It is- 
THE MOONLIGHT caressing Ryan's face. 
RYAN Landing, landing. Landing is launching. 
With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT. 
She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on. 
She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve, and begins to breath. As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face. 
She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin. 
She grabs the MANUAL. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Okay, landing, landing, landing is green. 
She opens the green binder and browses through its index. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Okay, okay landing, alright. 
She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual. 
Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her. She grabs it and as she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the MANUAL, where there is- 
A DIAGRAM- 
An ILLUSTRATION of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before landing and hitting the ground. A thrust is shooting out from under its bottom, cushioning its fall: THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay? 
She puts on the communication headset. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it. 
She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed. 
She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of the buttons. RYAN (CONT'D) You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much. 
Ryan smiles, remembering... and then- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Tri module separation, go... 
She presses the button. 
OUTER SPACE. 
The locks connecting the three modules of the Soyuz release. 
CONTROL CABIN, AIRLOCK, and the ENGINES SEPARATE. 
A mechanism pushes the CONTROL CABIN away from the AIRLOCK and the ENGINES, and it slowly gains distance from them. 
CONTROL CABIN. 
Ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the manual. 
RYAN Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth. 
A pause, and then-

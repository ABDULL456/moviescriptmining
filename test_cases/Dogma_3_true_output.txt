BETHANY 
She told me that if you behave, she'll give you head. 
JAY 
(excited) 
Yeah?. 
BETHANY 
Oh, a demon'd have a field day with you. 
Serendipity and Rufus watch them disappear up the steps. 
OC JAY 
(beat) 
Shut up. 
OC BETHANY 
You shut up. 
SERENDIPITY 
(to Rufus) 
Nice girl. 
RUFUS 
Comes from good stock. 
SERENDIPITY 
You haven't told her yet? 
RUFUS 
Not the right time. 
SERENDIPITY 
How uncanny is the resemblance? Those eves, the lips... 
RUFUS 
The nails. 
Serendipity looks at Rufus. He smiles. She hits him, laughing. He cracks up. 
SERENDIPITY 
Blasphemer. 
Then, the OC Golgothan makes a groggy, grumbling noise. 
SERENDIPITY 
Shit. You'd better go. I'll take care of the trash. 
RUFUS 
(hugs her) 
Good luck. 
Rufus runs up the steps. Serendipity tunrs on the Golgothan. 
SERENDIPITY 
Alright, Stinky - let's see what you know. 
EXT CHURCH -DAY 
A suited MAN stands at a podium, addressing a small thrall of reporters. 
MAN 
And now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness' 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign, ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind the movement - Cardinal Glick. 
The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one as more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers. 
GLICK 
Thank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, who donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday. 
(off index cards) 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Church has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes the average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral and psychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules and ornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in an effort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time of renewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that I present you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennial celebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with the first of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil over the next year. 
(applause) 
Now, what does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith? No. We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest membership numbers on the planet. 
A few applause ring out. Glick smiles. 
GLICK 
Thank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, for example... 
(pulls out crucifix) 
while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, we have decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressing symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces of wood as it's masthead? Of course not - who would? I've got enough downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual everytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new, more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new outlook. 
Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of Christ smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes. 
GLICK 
See? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into a church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement that whatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so... 
REPORTER I 
(interupting) 
Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on john Doe Jersey? Will he be given the right to die with dignity? 
Another buzz rises from the crowd. Glick rolls his eyes. 
GLICK 
C'mon people. We're not here to talk about that. It's an issue we stand firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just like abortion. Murder's murder. Why won't you people accept that? Besides, we're here to talk about this little guy - your friend and mine... the happy Jesus. Can't you just see it on chains around people's necks, and as the new background in avant garde, MTV videos? 
INT BUS TERNIINAL - DAY 
The image of the 'Happy jesus' - thumbs up and all - is captured on a t.v. monitor, a label reading U\'E VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK. NEW JERSEY' at the bottom of the screen. Bartleby and Loki look up at it, then at one another. 
LOKI 
And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence over this culture. 
BARTLEBY 
We're getting out of here at just the right time. These people are nuts. 
LOKI 
(off t.v.) 
And that's the church we're heading to? 
BARTLEBY 
(steps to ticket window) 
If you want to go home... 
(to WOMAN in window) 
Two tickets to New Jersey, please. 
WOMAN 
Jersey's sold out, sir. 
BARTLEBY 
Are you sure? 
WOMAN 
The computer says. 
LOKI 
Come on - how many people can possibly be going to New Jersey? 
WOMAN 
Enough to fill a bus. 
BARTLEBY 
(to Loki)

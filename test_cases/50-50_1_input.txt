KATIE Now, why do you say that? 
ADAM I don't know, it was a bad joke. 
KATIE But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel. 
Katie is losing Adam. 
KATIE (CONT'D) In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside. 
Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy. 
KATIE (CONT'D) So today what I want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy. 
Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion. 
ADAM Huh? 
KATIE I want you to lay back and close your eyes. 
Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch. 
ADAM Lay here? 
KATIE Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go. 
ADAM Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl? 
KATIE Another joke? 
ADAM (SHRUGS) Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny. 
KATIE Ssshhhhh... 
Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention. 
He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain. 
KATIE (CONT'D) Close your eyes and relax. Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer. 
Adam closes his eyes. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
RACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. No peeking. 
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed. 
ADAM I can't believe you got me a present. (BEAT) Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing? 
RACHEL (O.S.) Even better. 
ADAM What is it? 
RACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. 
ADAM You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted. 
RACHEL (O.S.) You're not adopted. 
ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was. 
Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam. 
RACHEL Okay. Open your eyes. 
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Surprise! 
Adam stares in confusion. 
ADAM (DISAPPOINTED) What is it? 
RACHEL It's Noodle. 
ADAM It's so small. What do you do with it? 
RACHEL (ANNOYED) Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process. 
ADAM Why, did it go to medical school? 
RACHEL (PISSED) I thought you'd be happy...

DOC We're going to have a lot of those, (easy, embracing her tightly) We're just going to get the money and then go all the way. 
CAROL (smiling at him) ... and live happily ever after. 
INT. VAN - A WATCH FACE - DAY 
SWEEP SECOND HAND TURNING 8:35. 
DOC'S HANDS - SETTING A BOMB-TIMING MECHANISM ATTACHED TO TWO STICKS of dynamite, two tubes of Naptha, a lot of prima cord and one small, dark percussion cap. 
CAROL SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE GREY PANEL TRUCK as it prowls smoothly down a brush-lined Central Texas road. Carol drives calmly, professionally... 
ANGLES DOC IS BEHIND CAROL, AT THE BACK OF THE VAN. He wears a jacket and watch cap. Doc is squatted down, quickly activating another timing mechanism, checking the clock-face on the bomb against his wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous movement, he places a bomb into the two large grocery bags at his feet. After burying the explosives within each sack, he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ANGLES (CONT'D) The grocery bags are then gently shoved forward, resting against the wheel well of the truck. 
As Doc looks at Carol... 
INT. A '65 BUICK - RUDY 
PARKED ALONG A SECLUDED PATHWAY, facing the highway which lies a quarter of a mile away. 
He has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailor's watch cap... he stares at the highway. 
THE PANEL TRUCK SLIDES BY...

EXT. MAIN STREET - BEACON CITY, TEXAS - DAY 
A sleepy, traditional municipality... 
A DAPPER GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES WALKS ALONG THE SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front door of the bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door and the Bank President moves inside. 
VISIBLE ON THE GLASS DOOR 
sign that reads: 
FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY 
Founded 1911 Hours: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM Weekdays Only 
INT. THE BANK 
THE PRESIDENT SNAPS ON A BANK OF IRRIDESCENT LIGHTS. Several TELLERS have begun setting up for the day's commerce... 
INT. PANEL TRUCK 
DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN   PULLS HIS .45 OUT from beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it, snaps it back to position. He replaces   the gun under his jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a precaution. 
A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather suitcase. 
CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the horizon through the windshield... 
INT. BANK 
THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive door as the vault begins to open... 
RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving in the opposite direction... 
JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES, then checks his watch. 
A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56. 
THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol. 
THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind. 
THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field near a corner of the town. 
Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to the sidewalk. 
Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street... 
CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the truck's window a traffic signal appears. 
RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main Street... 
INT. BANK 
THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door to stand open.

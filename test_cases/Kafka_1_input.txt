LUDWIG Frankly, we don't understand why you've even bothered pursuing this business. 
KAFKA It would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me. 
OSKAR But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult. 
LUDWIG My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip. 
Kafka suddenly points at the ground. 
KAFKA You've dropped some money. 
The Assistants immediately bend their heads to look -- and Kafka bangs them together as hard as he can. 
The Assistants sit on the ground in a stupefied daze while Kafka's running footsteps echo around the dark street.

CONTINENTAL COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bizzlebek, perched on his usual stool, turns to see Kafka at his side. 
KAFKA You work in the cemetery. 
BIZZLEBEK A man must eat -- (raises glass) And drink. 
KAFKA The Castle cemetery. 
CUT: 
CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Ancient tombstones crumbling with age, slanting out of the ground at bizarre angles, and cluttered so close together that a way can scarcely be made between them. 
Bizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways, overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle. 
Bizzlebek, who knows his way around, seems more cheerful here than we've seen him before.  Kafka more fearful.  Wind WHISTLES.  Leaves RUSTLE.  CREAKING trees cast ghastly shadows.  Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic symbols on them, mystical figures and designs. 
Trying to keep up with Bizzlebek, Kafka spots a horrendous shape looming ahead of him.  He starts to bypass it -- and jumps when a tall plant brushes against him. 
BIZZLEBEK (waits for Kafka) Are you sure you wouldn't prefer going through official channels? 
The awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a particularly large tombstone, crumbled in places to give it an animal-like suggestion. 
KAFKA Official channels -- a lot of good they've done me.  My only hope is to approach the officials personally. 
He keeps walking -- and we SEE that he's carrying the bomb- briefcase he found at Eduard's. 
BIZZLEBEK -- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details. (Kafka doesn't take that cue) -- To see such determination is reward enough for me. 
KAFKA The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth -- 
A BIRD rapidly swoops down from a tree, zipping past Kafka's head with a shrieking SQUAWK! 
KAFKA (gulp) -- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family. 
BIZZLEBEK There is one thing I'd like you to tell me. 
KAFKA I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point. 
BIZZLEBEK What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle? 
KAFKA The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something. (stops again, concerned) Isn't there? 
BIZZLEBEK In a manner of speaking.

1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1 
We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone. 
DRIVER O/S ...hundred thousand streets in this city, you don't need to know the route. You give me a time and place, I give you a five minute window. Those five minutes I'm yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute either side you're on your own... 
As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO: 
2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2 
A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different routes marked in pencil. The voice continues - 
DRIVER O/S ...One last thing. You won't be able to reach me at this number again... 
DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks. 
3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3 
Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle 
4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4 
The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes. Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives carefully, letting other cars overtake. 
5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5 
Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment block. 
6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6 
Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes meet briefly, before Driver walks on. 
7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7 
Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean, sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again. 
8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8 
Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse - vintage cars. 
9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9 
SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver follows him past rows of vintage cars. 
SHANNON ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside. You get any sleep? 
DRIVER Not this week. 
As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them. 
SHANNON I can offer you some Halcyon. 
DRIVER Won't work. 
They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they arrive at a plain looking Impala. 
SHANNON There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular car in the state of California... 
Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys. 
10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10 
The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter. Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's 9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.

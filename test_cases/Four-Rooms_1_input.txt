TED And make me an accessory in the murder of your husband? 
Ted collapses to his knees in front of Angela. 
TED That's not fair. It just isn't fair. 
ANGELA Get a fucking grip on yourself. First off, who says he's my husband? And second, we are a long way from fair here, fair is back in jolly old England eatin' crumpets and sipping on tea. 
Ted collects himself. 
TED Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well, maybe there are two sides to this thing. 
ANGELA There are two sides to a plate, still you only eat off of one. Now GET THE GUN! 
TED So why's he got you tied up? 
ANGELA I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun! 
Ted is at a loss as to what to do. Angela turns on the charm. 
ANGELA Come on, Ted. Come over here just for a minute. You can do it. Come on, Ted. You look like a good guy. 
Ted creeps towards her. 
ANGELA That's it, Teddy. You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured. 
Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He's heard from the bathroom belting out "Life is but a dream... she-boom, she- boom." 
ANGELA (she panics) Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag back in, and remember the gun! 
Ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth. 
TED Nine thousand, three hundred and twenty-two times, to the best of my estimation. 
INT. ROOM 
Sigfried coughs, sending a chill up Ted's spine. Ted whips around to discover Sigfried leaning up against the door to the bathroom. 
SIGFRIED I was just beginning to think I could trust you, Theodore. Silly me. 
Ted's fingers are frozen over Angela's lips. 
TED I was just trying to help her breathe a little. 
SIGFRIED Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You don't mind me calling you Teddy, do you? 
TED That's fine. 
SIGFRIED I used to have a little bunny rabbit named Teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. But don't let me stop you, Teddy... no need to play sneaky-poo. 
Ted starts to back toward the door. 
TED Look, man, if this is some kind of Voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife, there is absolutely no way. 
SIGFRIED (shouts at the top of his lungs) I said, nibble, asshole! Now! 
The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he closes in, Angela's eyes close. 
TED (whispers) Sorry, lady. 
Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela. 
SIGFRIED What's the matter, no whiz left in the cheese? I'm not cramping your style, am I? 
TED Look, I'm not playing this game anymore. 
Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him. 
SIGFRIED It's almost all over, Theodore, and soon you can go home to Mommy. 
Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue. 
TED My name is not Theodore, it's TED, TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes, my mother did me the service of naming me Theodore and I haven't a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long way away from here. Do you have any idea what it's like to go to school where all the other kids' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny, aggravated assault, burglary and murder, and you get stuck with a mother who names you Theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with, get this, a little blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll tell you what happens. Pretty soon Theodore becomes "Theo the Thumper," and when Theo the Thumper gets old enough, he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the whole bloody mess behind him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me now, because no one is going to call me that again. My name is Ted, okay? Got it? TED! 
Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand. 
SIGFRIED Sigfried. 
TED What? 
SIGFRIED My name is Sigfried.

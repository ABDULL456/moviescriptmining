The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks dis- turbed. 
WILLIE What'd he say now? 
INDIANA It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed... 
Indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
41.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - NIGHT                                         41. 
Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from the POV of somebody running in terror.  We hear heavy breathing -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon as an eerie wind rises and howls.  We continue crashing through the dying fields tward the dark village... 
42.    INT.  INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT                                    42. 
The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open.  He lies still a moment and then sits up slowly.  He sees Short Round sleeping nearby. 
Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet.  He steps around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut. 
43.    EXT.  THE HUT - NIGHT                                          43. 
Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around.  The village is asleep and seems deserted.  Then he turns and sees something. 
We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust... 
Indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the darkness. Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him.  Indy grabs the little boy as he falls into his arms. 
CUT TO: 
44.    INT.  THE SHAMAN'S HUT - NIGHT                                 44. 
A few minutes later, the little boy is lying unconscious on a blanket.  Elders crouch around him.  Indy is kneeling and watches the shaman wet the boy's forehead with a rag and drip water onto his lips. 
The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive.  Shrot Round And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the faces peering down at him. 
The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather than any of the others.  Indy takes his small hand and sees that the boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop something into Indy's hand. 
The little boy tries to whisper.  Indy has to lean close to hear as the little boy's lips move again -- 
LITTLE BOY Sankara... 
A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little boy.  His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited.  Indy stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him -- 
It is a small tattered piece of cloth:  an old fragment of a mini- ature painting.  Indiana looks at it with an expression of recog- nition and apprehension... 
INDIANA Sankara... 
45.    EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MORNING                                    45. 
The camera follows Indiana -- he's walking fast and determinded- ly.  Villagers trot alongside of him, trying to keep up with is pace as he questions thm in Hindi. 
Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide Sajnu trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them. 
INDIANA Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've got to move out! 
Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her face. 
WILLIE Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant... 
Waiting by the second elephant, Short Round sees Indy coming and runs up to him -- 
SHORT ROUND I ride with you, Indy? 
INDIANA Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. 
Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby elephant being brought out.  He can't believe his luck -- 
SHORT ROUND Oh boy! 
Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willie's elephant over.  The villagers look grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three stran- gers' departure. 
WILLIE (to Short Round) This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left. 
SHORT ROUND They don't cry about you.  They cry about the elephants leaving. 
WILLIE Figures... 
SHORT ROUND They got no food to feed them.  So they taking the elephants away to sell them. 
Indy lumbers over on his elephant. 
INDIANA All right, let's go.  I want to get to Pankot before tomorrow night. 
She looks at Indiana as he rides past. 
WILLIE Pankot?!  I thought we were going to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute! (looking at the villagers) Can't somebody take me to Delhi?! I don't want to go to Pankot! 
Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward -- 
WILLIE (Cont'd) (yelling) Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you change your mind?  What did that kid tell you last night?! 
Indy ignores her hollering.  The elephants move off through the crowds of pitiful villagers.  Indy sees the elders, chieftain and the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as Indy rides past.

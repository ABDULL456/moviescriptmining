VIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Wait in the car. 
The two men exit as Viggo walks towards the booth, shedding his jacket as he does so. 
Only one of John's hands is above the table, the other hovering beneath it, a pistol held tight, unwavering. 
Viggo slips into the seat. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) Is that really necessary? 
John answers by taking a sip of his coffee. Viggo shrugs with a frown, motioning towards the waitress as he flips over his mug. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) So be it. 
WAITRESS (filling the mug) Cream or sugar? 
VIGGO No, thank you. 
As she walks away, Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) It's been what? 30 years? 
JOHN Yeah, that's about right. 
VIGGO Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that. (a beat, then) Kids? 
JOHN No. 
VIGGO Lucky bastard. 
JOHN We tried, but... wasn't in the cards. 
VIGGO I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it... (GLOWERS) He's still my son. 
JOHN (NODS) I figured as much. 
VIGGO Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love. 
JOHN Imagine what one would do if they did. 
Viggo nods, takes a sip of his coffee, and stands. 
VIGGO Goodbye, John. 
JOHN Goodbye, Viggo. 
Viggo leaves the diner, and slides into- 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
-where four of his men wait, each armed with a silenced, submachine gun: intimidating hardware. 
Viggo closes the door, takes a deep breath, and sighs, rubbing his brow. 
VIGGO Kill him. 
BOOM! 
A round slams into his window, barely missing him before hitting the man seated next to him in the side of the head, blood spattering against glass. 
Viggo dives to the floor as his men prepare to return fire- 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
-but John is a crackshot, firing as he strides towards the VEHICLE- 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
-killing two men and wounding a fourth who drops down next to Viggo, screaming. 
VIGGO DRIVE! 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
John ejects a spent clip, slaps in a fresh one in a blink, and unloads into the limousine which jerks forward, tires squealing as it drives off. 
INT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS 
Viggo lies on his back, staring at the ceiling as he lights himself a cigarette. 
VIGGO People don't change. Do they, John? (to the screaming gunman) SHUT... THE FUCK... UP! 
EXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS 
John slips the gun into the back of his pants, turns, and calmly walks away.

CURTIS It's been about a month. He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Okay. This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. It's non- habit forming, but I'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime, (holds up the other slip) This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist. It's a drive, but he's the best I know. 
CURTIS Okay. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN I'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him. 
CURTIS All right. 
EXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - DAY 
The construction site sits in the middle of open farmland but is considerably more involved than Curtis' last job site. Dump trucks, backhoes and cement mixers roll and beep across muddy ground. A 20 MAN CREW operates throughout. 
NEAR THE WELL DRILLING RIG, Dewart pushes down a lever that activates the hydraulic lift for the drill. Curtis appears behind him. 
CURTIS Hey Dewart! 
DEWART 
(HALF TURNING) What you say Curtis? 
CURTIS Not much. Curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig. Sifts dirt through his fingers. 
DEWART They want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch. I figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig. 
CURTIS Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend all right? 
DEWART Yeah. Same old shit. 
EXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - LATER 
It's lunchtime. The men sit around in different groups eating out of bagged lunches. Curtis eats a sandwich and watches the men. Some bitching. Others laughing. 
Wind blows through a wooded area nearby. He watches the leaves move. He looks to the sky. It's a beautiful day. Almost peaceful. 
EXT. SHEPHERD INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY 
The insurance office sits in a row of small downtown buildings. 
INSURANCE AGENT (O.S.) No. I need the name of the specialist whose diagnosis you'll accept. 
INT. SHEPHERD INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY 
An INSURANCE AGENT(62) sits behind her desk with the phone to her ear. She's an older woman wearing a pant suit. Samantha sits by a fake plant and sips a Coke. She watches Hannah play with building blocks from a plastic tub provided by the office. 
INSURANCE AGENT (into the phone) No. Look it. I've told you this twice. Please. Just get me the name and or the approval code.

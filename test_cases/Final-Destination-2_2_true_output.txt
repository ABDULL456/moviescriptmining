Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to get to a side door. 
INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway. An ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie. 
As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven. 
They edge closer. They peek inside the -- 
INT. CREMATORIUM 
Oddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a momentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all! 
They jump back - bumping right into: 
MR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has inexplicably appear BEHIND THEM. 
MORTICIAN Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you. 
The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY toward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared. 
KIMBERLY Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer. 
Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less. 
MORTICIAN Come to... Pick my brain? 
The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's mouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray. 
MORTICIAN (to Kimberly) Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final -- 
CLEAR (not falling for this again) Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend. 
The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and hits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze. 
MORTICIAN Fire away. 
CLEAR How do you cheat Death once and for all? 
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence. 
MORTICIAN Dead.   But still fresh. 
Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear has had about enough. 
CLEAR (to the Mortician) Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us. 
The Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING. 
MORTICIAN For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there 
are no escapes. 
CLEAR Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once, but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten. 
A sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring OFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles. 
MORTICIAN Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think? 
Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes. 
CLEAR It can be beaten.   And you know it. 
CREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven. 
MORTICIAN Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life... 
His words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters. 
MORTICIAN Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death. (off their confusion) The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s. 
Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist. 
MORTICIAN The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence. 
Evan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly. 
THOMAS What the hell does that mean? 
MORTICIAN (with finality) To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s. 
The Mortician grabs Kimberly.

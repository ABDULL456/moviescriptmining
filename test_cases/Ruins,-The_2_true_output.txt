She spins back toward the Mayans, takes a step into the clearing. The bald man SHOUTS at her, a single short sentence in MAYAN. Amy holds out her hands to him. AMY (cont'd) Espanol? Habla Espanol? Jeff steps forward, grabs her elbow. 
JEFF They killed Henrich. Why would- Amy tries to tug free, but he won't let her. She starts to SHOUT at the Mayans: 
AMY Help usi We need help! The Mayans just stare at her, their weapons raised, their faces expressionless. one of them is much younger than the others, almost a boy. He says something in MAYAN to the bald man, and the bald man shakes his head. Amy begins to CRY. Jeff pulls at her elbow. 
JEFF We have to get back. Amy turns toward him, her face smeared with tears. 
AMY I didn't want to come. I told you we shouldn't. I said-- Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake, as if to wake her up. 
JEFF Listen to me. Mathias needs our help. Right now. He-- 
AMY We shouldn't even be here. Why did you say we'd come? (she wipes at her tears) You have to do something. (rising toward a shout) You have to! It's your fault. It's all your-- Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap: 
JEFF YD-q stepped onto the hill. Amy stares at him, startled into silence. JEFF (cont'd) They wouldn't have forced us up it if you hadn't. He holds her eyes, making sure she understands. Then: JEFF (cont'd) Now let's go, okay? He starts to pull her back toward the trail. She allows herself to be led; she's begun to CRY again: 
AMY I didn't know. I just-- She's growing increasingly upset, almost SOBBING. She tries to turn back toward the Mayans again, but Jeff won't let her. AMY (cont'd) They have to help us. 
JEFF They're not going to. 
AMY They have to. She wrenches herself free, stumbles, falls into the vines beside the trail. Jeff reaches for her, but she kicks away from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her feet. As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging from its roots. She SCREAMS, spinning toward the clearing--- AMY (cont'd) 
WHY WON'T YOU FUCKING HELP US? --and throws the tendril at the Mayans. They scramble backward, with surprising panic, SHOUTING. The youngest of them is too slow: the length of vine hits him in the leg. He stares down at the tendril in shock. The others back hurriedly away from him. Two of them continue to point their weapons at Amy, but the bald man and one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now. There's SHOUTING from the tree line. The entire campsite is on its feet; a woman begins to SCREAM. 
She's in her,forties, short and stout, and she starts forward into the clearing, arms stretched toward the young Mayan. Two of the other women grab her, hold her back. The bald Mayan starts to ADDRESS the young man, pointing up the hillside. The short woman keeps SCREAMING, flailing, trying to break free. The young Mayan looks at her, then at the bald man. He speaks in MAYAN, a brief burst of words. The bald man shakes his head, points up the hill again, his pistol aimed at the young man's chest. The short woman is WAILING, eyes shut. The young Mayan takes a step toward her, CALLING what seems to be her name. The bald man SHOUTS at him, but the young Mayan ignores him, takes a second step, then a third. The bowmen are all aiming at him now, and suddenly, everyone seems to be YELLING. The young Mayan takes a fifth step, holding out his arms toward the WAILING woman, CALLING to her. The bald man FIRES, shooting him in the head. At the same instant, the bowmen let their arrows fly, the shafts THUMPING into the young man's chest, burying themselves to the fletches. The clearing goes still; the only sound is the woman's steady WAILING. Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and Jeffs he SHOUTS in MAYAN at them. The other Mayans nock fresh arrows, draw their bows. Jeff takes a step backward, half-raising his hands. Amy just stands there, her eyes on the young Mayan's motionless body. 
JEFF 
AMY... (no reaction) 
AY. She turns, finally. She looks horrified, stupefied; her hands are burned a deep red from the vine's sap. Jeff waves her up the hill. She stares at him for another beat, and then, without a word, starts to climb the trail. Jeff hesitates, watching the Mayans: the bloodied corpse, the raised weapons, the KEENING woman. Then he, too, turns and hurries off up the trail. 
EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY 
Amy, Jeff, and Eric have taken down the blue tent; its contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing. All three of them look sun struck, sweat-stained, worn out. 
Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon. Amy is braiding three of the strips together. Jeff has one of the backpack frames, the roll of duct tape, and some of the poles from the tent; he's making a backboard. 
ERIC Maybe we could use it as a weapon, you know? Wrap it around some stones or something. And throw them, like grenades. I mean, if they're that scared of it-- Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth. 
JEFF They have guns, Eric. And bows. What do you think they'll do if we start throwing the vine at them? Eric is silenced by this. He cuts another long strip of nylon, passes it to Amy. But he can't seem to stop himself from talking: 
ERIC. So you figure it's, what? Sacred or something? Like, you touch it and you have to die? Amy begins to cry suddenly--a SOB, quickly suppressed. Jeff and Eric both turn to look at her. The vine's sap has scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows. She wipes her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head. 
AMY I'm okay. But she doesn't look it. Jeff removes his hat, holds it out. Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take it. 
JEFF Come on. You're burning. She reaches for the hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes again. Jeff leans forward, touches her. JEFF (cont'd) We're gonna get through this. All right? We'll pull them up. And then ...I don't know--we'll figure things out. it has to rain at some point. And maybe we can snare some birds. Or-- 
The electronic RINGING sounds once more from the bottom of the shaft. They all turn to stare. 
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT The oil lamp has begun to smoke, adding a haze to the light. Stacy is beside Mathias, holding his hand. She's still pressing Jeff's shirt to her wound. The RING sounds again. Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the dirt wall to his left: that's where it's coming from. Stacy reaches to pick up the lamp, rises to her feet. Another RING. Jeff SHOUTS down from above: 
JEFF (O.S.) Stacy...? Stacy ignores him; she limps around Mathias, starts toward the opening. She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft, lifting her lamp to see better. There's another RING. 
-STACY'S POV -- INTO THE SHAFT The lamp's light doesn't penetrate very far, but WE can SEE that the vine has taken root here with great avidity: it grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof. There's a steady draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it, RUSTLING.

AUSTIN Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating-- 
BASIL EXPOSITION I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo. 
Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY. 
AUSTIN (crushed) Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think it's time to retire. 
BASIL EXPOSITION I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned. 
AUSTIN Again? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Again. 
INT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM 
Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the largest room you've ever seen in your life. 
BASIL EXPOSITION We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine. 
Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains. 
Austin tries to read them and gets queasy. 
AUSTIN I can't read in the car. I get a bit vomy. 
Austin burps and swallows it. 
AUSTIN Got it. I almost gipped. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.) Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is in the year 1969. Luckily, we also have a time travel device. After years of research we've developed a machine that will transport you back to the Sixties. 
A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by Peter Max. 
AUSTIN But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle? 
BASIL EXPOSITION That's what they'd like you to believe. 
AUSTIN So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? (goes cross-eyed) Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (to camera) I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself. 
Austin gets into the car and turns it on. 
AUSTIN This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Good luck, Austin. 
AUSTIN Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil. 
Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and smashes some equipment. 
AUSTIN Sorry. (changing gears) Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, yeah! 
The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, leaving flaming tread marks. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - LONDON - 
The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws the hukka down. Austin hops out. 
AUSTIN I feel better already, man! 
Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car. 
EXT. PARK - LONDON

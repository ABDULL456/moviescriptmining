Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him. 
TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. 
TAGGE That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? 
TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. 
TAGGE And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. 
VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. 
MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it! 
VADER Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. 
MOTTI Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... 
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell. 
VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing. 
TARKIN Enough of this! Vader, release him! 
VADER As you wish. 
TARKIN This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke. 
EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 
The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies. 
LUKE It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. 
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks. 
BEN They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. 
LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. 
BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. 
LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? 
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together. 
LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! 
Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it. 
BEN Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. 
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler. 
EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 
Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder. 
EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD 
The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place. 
LUKE Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen! 
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him. 
EXT. SPACE 
Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star. 
INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR 
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader. 
VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base. 
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard. 
EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 
There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him. 
BEN There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. 
LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. 
EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 
The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing. 
BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. 
Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile. 
EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET 
The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke. 
TROOPER How long have you had these droids? 
LUKE About three or four seasons. 
BEN They're for sale if you want them. 
TROOPER Let me see your identification. 
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice. 
BEN You don't need to see his identification. 
TROOPER We don't need to see his identification.

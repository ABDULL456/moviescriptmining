The CAMERA LINGERS on the birthday cake. 
As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut! 
CUT TO: 
INT. FILM STUDIO - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End store. 
A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a crowd of extras surround her. 
As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking towards the Director. 
CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside the camera. 
BADEN OK. Print that one! 
He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods his head in agreement. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. He shakes his head in disagreement. 
The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's finger automatically wags back. 
CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him. 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR All right, everyone! Back at two! 
Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to disperse. 
CLOSE SHOT of one of the extras (VIVIAN) - a small, vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features. 
She edges towards the camera crew. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her. 
Over his shoulder WE SEE Vivian glance towards him. He nods almost imperceptibly. 
Vivian hurries towards the exit. 
Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera and a little full string bag containing his lunch. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STUDIO GROUNDS - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian munching a sandwich. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK 
She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room). 
Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player. We hear music - modem rhythms. 
There are several people strolling about - but no one in the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - settling down on the other side of the wall (where they can talk without being seen together). 
VIVIAN Mark? 
MARK Hallo... 
VIVIAN Were you spotted? 
MARK Don't think so. 
VIVIAN (switches off music) Is it tonight? 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
MARK Yes. 
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. 
VIVIAN Mark... 
MARK Yes? 
VIVIAN You're sure we won't be caught? 
MARK Not if you do as I tell you. 
VIVIAN I will, I promise. 
MARK You haven't... said anything... to anyone? 
VIVIAN Of course not. 
MARK Good... like some cake? 
VIVIAN Thank you. 
We see him break off a piece of birthday cake, and pass it over to her. 
VIVIAN Mark... I want to be quite clear about this... 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at his cake. 
VIVIAN Tonight, when the studio's empty... I'm to come back-and you're going to give me a film test... right? 
MARK Right. 
VIVIAN You'll then print the film - so I can show it to my agent and anyone else who matters - right? 
MARK Right. 
VIVIAN Mark... 
She hesitates. 
VIVIAN I've been offered film tests before... but I haven't liked the terms. 
MARK There aren't any. 
VIVIAN Then why are you doing this? Risking your job and... 
MARK Not just for you... Viv... I have an agent too - and I want to show him what I can do... I want to direct... 
VIVIAN (switching on music again) There's someone coming. 
Mark lies motionless behind the wall. A young male EXTRA comes towards Vivian. 
EXTRA Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't it? 
VIVIAN Yes. 
EXTRA Thought I saw you talking to somebody...

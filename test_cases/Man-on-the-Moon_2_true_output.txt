CUT TO: 
INT. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE - ONE WEEK LATER 
A SMUG COMIC stands on stage, speaking into camera.  The show's going out live. 
SMUG COMIC Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea. (beat) Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman's a comic genius.  But others disagree... they say he's just not funny anymore. (beat) So we're putting the decision up to you.  Please call up and vote.  To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To DUMP him, call... 
INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY 
Tight on Andy, staring at the LA Times.  A small headline says "JOKESTER ANDY KAUFMAN VOTED OFF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'" 
He is bothered. 
ANDY This is bad... I only got 28 percent!  I'm like McGovern in 
George sighs. 
GEORGE And this wasn't "Merv."  This was the hippest audience on television. (grim) They've turned on you. 
At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to Andy.  But only the back of his head is visible. 
GEORGE (cont'd) It's like you two guys wanted to destroy Andy's career!  Upsetting all those people... putting out that toxic venom... (helpless) What did you THINK would happen?! 
ANDY (guilty) We were just trying to push the envelope -- 
GEORGE You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!! (beat) It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- (pained) I don't want you two to ever work together again. 
We WIDEN... 
And the other person is JERRY LAWLER.  He feels bad. 
JERRY LAWLER I'm sorry.  We thought it was funny... 
ANDY Jer', it's not your fault.  You were terrific. (sad) But maybe George is right... 
JERRY LAWLER That's fine.  But I wouldn't have traded it for anything... (poignant) Because for one brief, shining moment... the world thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally. 
ANDY We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake. 
JERRY LAWLER Alright, buddy... (choked up) Stay good. 
Andy and Jerry hug. 
A touching beat... until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam. 
ANDY Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount... 
GEORGE Andy!  You don't get it! (somber) They don't want you back. 
Andy's face drops. 
INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY 
The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought.  A few DISCIPLES IN TURBANS mill around. 
INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY 
NINE STUDENTS, sitting in the Lotus position, are listening to a teacher.  The teacher is Andy. 
ANDY Open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... 
Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are blinking their eyes faster and faster. 
The door opens.  The Yogi sticks his head in. 
YOGI Excuse me, Andy... 
ANDY Yes, your Holiness? 
The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room. 
INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY 
Andy steps out. 
YOGI This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat. 
ANDY (surprised) Why??  I... I attend every year. 
YOGI Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically. 
Andy is stunned. 
ANDY "Philosophically"? 
YOGI (he sighs) The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. (beat) It seems you have no respect for anything. 
Andy is stupefied.  He doesn't know how to respond. 
ANDY Of course I do... 
The Yogi shakes his head.  Andy can't believe it.  He looks around -- men in turbans staring at him. 
Andy cracks. 
ANDY Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!

Todd suddenly gasps -- a great, shocking intake of breath as his whole body tenses like iron-- 
Mrs. Lovett spins to him-- 
TODD The Judge. 
Mrs. Lovett hurries to the window-- Below, they can see the Judge and the Beadle approaching. They see them exchanging a few words and then the Beadle moves off as the Judge approaches the shop-- 
Todd whispers, his eyes blazing: 
TODD Justice ... Justice. 
Mrs. Lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly leaves. A beat as Todd prepares himself. 
He turns from the window and looks around the shop, shifting nervously. Now that his great moment of revenge is at hand, he doesn't quite know what to do with himself.

He snatches up his large razor, coils by the door, ready to attack. No. He wants to savor this. He quickly moves and puts the razor down. 
Finally he just stands. All his demons settling into a bizarre sort of calm. 
He hears the Judge's footsteps approaching on the stairs. Then the Judge enters. 
JUDGE Mr. Todd? 
Todd slowly turns: 
TODD At your service ... An honor to receive your patronage, my lord. 
JUDGE You know me, sir? 
TODD (a polite bow) Who in this wide world is not familiar with the honored Judge Turpin? 
The Judge grunts and glances around the shop: 
JUDGE These premises are hardly prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells me you are the most accomplished of all the barbers in the city. 
TODD That is gracious of him, sir ... (indicates for the Judge to sit) ... Sit, if you please, sir. Sit. 
The Judge settles into the parlor chair as music begins... 
TODD And what may I do for you today, sir? A stylish trimming of the hair? A soothing skin massage? 
JUDGE You see, sir, a man infatuate with love, Her ardent and eager slave. So fetch the pomade and pumice stone And lend me a more seductive tone, 
(CONTINUED) PAGE 54. 38   CONTINUED: (4)                                              38 
A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne, But first, sir, I think -- a shave. 
TODD The closest I ever gave. 
He whips a sheet over the Judge, then tucks the bib in. The Judge hums, flicking imaginary dust off the sheet; Todd whistles gaily. 
JUDGE You're in a merry mood today, Mr. Todd. 
TODD (mixing lather) 'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire From one man to the next. 
JUDGE 'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire The blood to pound, the heart leap higher. 
BOTH What more, what more can man require-- 
JUDGE Than love, sir? 
TODD More than love, sir. 
JUDGE What, sir? 
TODD Women. 
JUDGE Ah yes, women. 
TODD Pretty women. 
The Judge hums jauntily, Todd whistles and starts stropping his razor rhythmically. He then lathers the Judge's face. 
Still whistling, Todd stands back to survey the Judge, who is now totally relaxed, eyes closed. 
Todd goes to his razor and picks it up, sings to it gently:

TODD Now then, my friend. Now to your purpose. Patience, enjoy it. Revenge can't be taken in haste. 
JUDGE (opening his eyes) Make haste, and if we wed, You'll be commended, sir. 
TODD My lord... (Goes to him) And who, may it be said, Is your intended, sir?

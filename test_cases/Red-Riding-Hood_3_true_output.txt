HENRI I didn't have to tell him. 
GRANDMOTHER So he knew your secrets, did he? Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily nailing a shoe to the horse's foot. BANG! BANG! BANG! 
GRANDMOTHER You were the only one who could have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's night. And none of the men who went hunting for the Wolf remember seeing you after the sun set on the night your father died. Henri faces her, clutching the hammer... 
HENRI Why are you doing this? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GRANDMOTHER Because I want you to confess. You killed Lucie. And your father. And God only knows how many others. And if you won't admit it, then I will tell Father Solomon and we will lock you up until the moon rises tomorrow night and you can no longer hide your guilt. As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization comes over him. Realization and horror. 
HENRI It's you. Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps back and finds herself bumping against the closed door. 
HENRI My God, it's you. You're the Wolf. I can smell it on you now. 
GRANDMOTHER Smell what? What are you talking about? 
HENRI The night my father died. I saw the Wolf pass by, dragging him by the neck. I was so terrified I couldn't move or make a sound. I remember every detail of that moment. The way the moonlight gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The soundless way it moved. I even remember the way it smelled. A thick, greasy, musky stink. 
(BEAT) And I can smell it on you right now. A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another. 
GRANDMOTHER You accuse me and I'll bring you down with me. All they can do is take my life. You have more to lose. 
HENRI But who do you think they'll believe? I'm the blacksmith.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
HENRI (CONT'D) They know me. You're the crazy old woman who lives in the woods. 
GRANDMOTHER Then I'll have to prove it. 
HENRI Unless you can, you'd best keep your mouth shut. Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside -- 
EXT. STABLE - NIGHT 
-- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look. 
CESAIRE Are you ready for me to take you home? She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look. 
EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT 
Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece. 
GRANDMOTHER Stop the cart. Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out: 
GRANDMOTHER Prudence, come with me. I have some blankets I want you to mend for Father Auguste. Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart. 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
The cart stops out front. Grandmother turns to Prudence. 
GRANDMOTHER You take these blankets to Father Auguste the moment you're finished. Understand? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PRUDENCE All right. Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart. 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets. He has tears in his eyes.

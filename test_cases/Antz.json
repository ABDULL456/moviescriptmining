(over a dark screen) All my life, I've lived and worked in the big city... \nWe see: \nEXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY \nThe camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along... \n...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a \"traffic cop\" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers. \nZ (V.O.) ...which is kind of a problem, since I've always felt uncomfortably in crowds. \nINT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nWe join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch, recounting his woes. \nZ I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. (pause) I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub.  The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant. \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR (enthusiastic) Terrific!  You should feel insignificant! \nFor the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR. He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of \"Ronco\"). \nZ ...I should? \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR (hopping around enthusiastically) YES!!!  You know, people ask me, \"Doctor, why are you always happy?\" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't mind that I don't matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get it? \nZ gives a fake smile. \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR (incredibly \"up\") Z, we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world! \nThe counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow shows ant population going up, up, up. \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR Ask me why we're so successful. \nZ Why are we so successful? \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR I'm glad you asked me that question! \nThe motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a vista of the ant-filled chamber below. \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR What do you see out there? \nZ ...Ants... \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together! \nDown below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task. \nMOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, \"Hey -- I'm meaningless, you're meaningless.\" \nCARPENTER ...Yes, sir. \nGENERAL FORMICA What have they got to complain about? Three square meals a day... \nCARPENTER Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week. \nFORMICA Don't give me statistics, Carpenter. I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS! \nFormica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase. There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge SQUEAKS. \nFORMICA (to guard ant, while passing) Oil that, soldier. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY \nThe QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her. \nQUEEN Ah!  General Formica. \nFormica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him. \nNote:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short \"Happy Birthday\" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet- line, powered by ants on a treadmill. \nQUEEN General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry... (she shudders; then, to baby) Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth! (to mid-wife) Ship 'er out. (back to Formica) What steps are you taking to remedy the situation? \nFORMICA We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory... \nQUEEN Yes, what else? \nFORMICA Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively. \nThe Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms. \nQUEEN (to baby) No snacking between meals!  Off you go! (to Formica) Now -- what were we saying? \nFORMICA (Oliver North-style) I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all? \nQUEEN Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you. \nFormica clicks his heels and bows his head.  Carpenter bows low.  Formica smartly about faces -- \nBALA (O.S.) General Formica! \nPRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book.  Something about her sets her apart from the HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her.  Her tiara, probably. \nFormica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him. \nCARPENTER (sotto) Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee. \nFORMICA Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you? \nBALA Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another. \nFormica looks confused. \nQUEEN Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General. \nBALA It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation? \nBALA Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom. (concerned) Do I look fat to you? \nHANDMAIDEN #2 (knowingly, to Handmaiden #2) Pre-wedding jitters. \nHANDMAIDEN #1 You just need to blow off some steam. Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club! \nBALA The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different. \nHANDMAIDEN #2 There isn't anyplace else -- (making a joke) Except the worker bar. \nBALA The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! \nThe handmaidens look shocked. \nHANDMAIDEN #1 But -- we can't -- there'll be workers there. \nINT. ANT BAR - NIGHT \nA long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier. \nZ We declared war again? (off Weaver's nod) Are you scared? \nWEAVER (shrugs) I'll be back. \nThe BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids. \nAPHIDS (as they're slapped on bar) Ouch!  Ouch! \nBARTENDER Two aphid beers. \nZ (as Bartender leaves) Did you see that?  How he gave you the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers. \nWEAVER I don't know what you're talking about, Z. \nZ Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them. \nWEAVER Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes. \nWe can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of \"Worker Babes\", including Z's friend Azteca. \nZ Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. (sighs) No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me. \nWEAVER Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. (quaffing his aphid beer) Don't you want your aphid beer? \nZ I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy. \nWEAVER Z, we've known each other a long time, right? \nZ Of course.  You were born two seconds after me. \nWEAVER And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow. \nZ Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid. \nDown the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant has had too much to drink. \nDRUNK SCOUT Have you been to Insectopia?  Have you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I have... (becoming emotional) ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles -- all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...No rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there... (howling drunkenly) It's Insectopia!  Insectopia! \nThe handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on -- \nZ, who's watching the other ants dance. \nZ What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- \nBALA Wanna dance? \nBala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten. \nZ Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean -- (regaining suavosity) Just let me finish my beer. \nNot breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely. Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face. \nHe plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her. \nZ So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before? \nBALA (covering up) I work in the palace, I don't get out much. \nZ The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding -- \nBALA (shocked) What? \nZ and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but Z can't do any of the steps. \nZ Now, let's see, I -- it's been a while since I -- I think you -- \nBala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions. \nZ Here, I'll lead. \nZ starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive. \nBALA Are you sure this is a real dance? \nZ Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- \nBALA (surprised) Really? \nZ Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow. \nBALA You're right! \nZ (surprised) You -- you think I'm right? \nBALA Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! \nBala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's back at the moment. \nSOLDIER Hey!  Watch your step, worker. \nZ has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE, glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off. \nBALA You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! \nZ (terrified) Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. (whispering to Bala) Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble! (ineptly trying to placate the soldier) You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- \nZ (pause) Well I'm gonna start doing things for you... \nWEAVER Will you introduce me to some worker girls? \nZ You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you! \nWEAVER Maybe I'll get lucky. (Weaver thinks about it) You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you... \nWeaver hands Z has helmet. \nWEAVER Wear this. \nZ (overjoyed) You're a real buddy. \nWEAVER (sourly) Yeah, I know. \nZ What do I do? \nWEAVER Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection! \nWeaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation. \nZ (overjoyed) Thanks!  I owe you! \nZ skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little. \nINT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT \nThe ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads, \"GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey\". \nZ turns to some of the soldiers near him. \nZ Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up?  She's kind of a personal friend. \nThe soldiers look at Z like he's nuts. \nLOUD VOICE ATTEN-SHUN! \nMARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly. \nGENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect) \nFORMICA First of all, let me make one thing clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself.  All this \"thinking\" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head. \nIn the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's just made a joke. \nZ (slapping his thigh) \"Trapped inside your head\" -- that's a good one -- \nZ notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops. \nZ Geez -- tough room. \nFrom the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants.  He continues. \nFORMICA (striding back and forth) We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told.  We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere! (dramatic pause) Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws! \nThe soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them. \nBARBATUS Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot deserters! \nZ swallows hard. \nBARBATUS You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you. (off Z's look) Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind? \nZ Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. (nervously) So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition? \nBARBATUS No -- we're going to attack the termites! \nZ (alarmed) Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile! \nAround Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital. \nANT SOLDIERS (to the tune of \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\") We ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter termites just for fun, Hurrah! Hurrah! \nZ So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects? \nBARBATUS (grim smile) No such luck.  Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads! \nSOLDIER ANTS We ants go marching two by two, hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah! \nMontage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen, fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen... \nZ Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork? \nBARBATUS Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle! \nANT SOLDIERS We ants are marching three by three, hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah! \n...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as they're getting stepped on... \nZ So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?! \nBARBATUS Superior numbers, kid! \nEXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT \nZ looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts an order. \nCOLONEL ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!! \nThe front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony...Z is swept along... \nBARBATUS Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!! \nZ is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance. Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very middle of the termite colony... \nInto a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around suspiciously. \nBARBATUS It's too damn quiet. \nThen we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over, and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear. \nBARBATUS Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back. \nZ (petrified) Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home. \nZ (backing away) Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro! \nAt the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin to rumble... \nThe termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen. \nAs the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above...they keep struggling until... \nANT OFFICER (points at Z) He's killed their Queen! \nZ Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake -- \nANT OFFICER VICTORY!!! \nWe can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants. \nZ (facetious) This is terrific!   Let's exact crippling war reparations!  Let's set up a puppet government! \nANT OFFICER Let's slaughter them all! \nThe ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look up confusedly... \n...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a CRASH.  The ten or so ants standing directly below are smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above... \nANT OFFICER INCOMING! \nThe tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and again... \nZ heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down again, barely missing him! \nZ retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him, across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants and struggling termites... \n....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow... \nAnd we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it ricochets along the walls! \nZ gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him, reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to Z...closer... \n...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final contented burp, shuffle off into the distance. \nEXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING \nZ makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an expression of horror on his face. \nBARBATUS (O.S.) Z!  Over here! \nZ (hopeful) Barbatus? \nZ looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living, decapitated head is looking up at him. \nZ (shocked) Barbatus! \nBARBATUS Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad? \nZ No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks. \nBARBATUS No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus. (he winces) I can't feel my legs... \nThe other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the colony. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nA huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back.  A band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in, followed by Carpenter. \nEXCITED ANTS The army's returned!  Our brave boys are back! (etc.) \nEveryone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah- oompahs... \n...and Z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears. \nThe band slows to a halt. \nAt the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's shoulders, can just about see over the crowd. \nAZTECA It looks like only one soldier made it back! \nWeaver looks distraught. \nWEAVER (to himself) Poor Z -- I should never have let you go! \nFar down the hall, Z is describing the battle. \nZ It was horrible...a massacre, a massacre upon a massacre.  First we massacred them, then they massacred us, then it was halftime.  I've never seen such violence, such bloodthirstiness, such bad manners...I'm the only one that made it! \nThe atmosphere is somber.  This is a tough one to try and put a spin on...but that doesn't stop Formica from trying. \nFORMICA ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN! \nThe band strikes up again, and everyone cheers. \nZ No -- you -- you don't understand! \nFORMICA Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party! \nZ Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there? \nFORMICA Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you. \nZ (thinks) ONE TO NOTHING! \nRenewed CHEERS, as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of the soldiers who stayed behind. \nAZTECA Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z! \nWEAVER Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it! \nZ is following Formica away from the cheering crowd. \nEXT. ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY \nZ and Formica are going up the royal \"stairway\" together. \nFORMICA Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs. \nBALA I'm Princess Bala. \nZ Ah, yes. (affected) Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero? \nBALA Yes. \nZ (deflated) Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter. \nShe moves towards the dance floor.  Z spit-combs his antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword. He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns toward him, turning it into a ballet plies. \nZ Just warming up... \nShe frowns...there's something familiar about this guy.  But then they start dancing. \nACROSS THE ROOM: The Queen and General Formica watch the party. \nQUEEN All these parties are so marvellously alike. \nFORMICA They should be... (suspicious) But there's something funny about that soldier. \nFormica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing. \nFORMICA (glowering) May I cut in? \nZ (intimidated) Oh, of course -- \nBALA (pulling Z back) No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero. \nZ (trying to placate Formica) Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it -- \nBala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from Formica. \nBALA You dance... \nZ Divinely? \nBALA No weirdly...You remind me of someone... \nFormica catches Bala's eye.  She frowns at him, and decides to get a little shocking. \nBALA He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual. \nAs she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly. \nBALA He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I? \nZ (proudly) No...as a matter of fact... \nBALA (shocked) OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER! \nEverybody gasps.  The dancing stops cold. \nZ Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you. \nBALA I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER! \nZ (offended) That's not what you said the other night -- \nWEAVER (taking Azteca's hand) Right...because every ant's important! \nWORKER #2 (scoffs) But that would mean I'm important. \nWORKER #1 I'm outta here, this sounds like trouble to me. \nBut more ants are gathering 'round. \nWEAVER We can all be individuals!  Just like Z! \nWeaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering around, dropping their tools... \nEXT. BIKE PATH - DAY \nLONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of \"The Sun's Anvil\" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness. \nThey're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the park, which they perceive to be a \"desert\". \nBALA Water...water... \nZ Water...water -- oh, you already said that. \nBALA (walking along) My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. \nZ I ruined your life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable. \nOver Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them). \nBALA Look out! \nBala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a gigantic millwheel. \nBALA We're going to die! \nZ Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again? \nNo sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past. \nZ Well I'll be. \nBala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away. \nBALA Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me? \nZ Want a list? \nBALA (urgent) Wait, I hear something! \nWe can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause and then we can hear it again... \nZ and Bala walk over a rocky \"dune\" (the soft shoulder of the path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to the end of the \"desert\" (i.e. the other side of the path) Through the blades of grass, we can see... \nZ It's...it's... \nBALA WATER!!! \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nZ, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder. \nINT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY \nFormica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the tunnel with a squad of soldiers. \nFORMICA Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford any delays on this project! \nCARPENTER I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look! \nAhead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped work and are sitting down, chanting... \nWORKER ANTS Z!  Z!  Z!  Z! \nA worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his tool. \nFOREMAN (yelling at him) Where do ya think you're going?  Get back to work! \nWORKER #1 Buzz off, I'm important! (joining the others) Z!  Z!  Z!  Z! \nAt the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding hands, leading the chant. \nFORMICA Notice the big one, holding hands with the female? \nCARPENTER Well, uh, who notices workers, sir? \nFORMICA (calculating) No one should have to.  Have him brought to me. \nINT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nA nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by a couple of stoic guards.  Carpenter stands smiling by the side door.  There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the atmosphere is truly intimidating. \nFORMICA So this Z...he fancies himself an individual? \nWEAVER Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir. \nFORMICA (patronizing) Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you? \nWEAVER Oh, no, sir! \nFORMICA Good.  You're a good soldier. \nWEAVER Thank you, sir. \nWeaver begins to relax a bit. \nFORMICA So tell me.  Where's Z? \nWEAVER I...I have no idea, sir. \nFORMICA Okay, son. \nHe pats Weaver on the shoulder. \nFORMICA We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No single ant matters, right? \nWEAVER (enthusiastically) That's correct, sir! \nZ goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it. \nZ There's - there's some kind of force field! \nBala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.  Then both of them hear laughter from above. \nMALE WASP (O.S.) (lockjawed accent) Muffy, look, party-crashers. \nFEMALE WASP (O.S.) (laughing) They're simply too much, Chip! \nBala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in the air above them.  The husband and wife wasps have lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents. \nMALE WASP (to Z and Bala) You down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic? \nZ Hunh? \nFEMALE WASP Habla Ingles? (to Male Wasp) Well I really don't know who they are. \nZ We're ants! \nThe Male Wasp zooms in closer. \nMALE WASP Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we? (to Z) Are you related to the Fifth Avenue ants? \nFEMALE WASP Darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street? \nMALE WASP Just being friendly, Poopsie. \nBALA Hello?  I'm not just \"any insect\". My mother is the Queen. (momentously) I'm Princess Bala! \nMALE WASP (under his breath) They're Eurotrash, dear. \nWe hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit down for their picnic lunch.  Gigantic hands reach down and pull away the \"force fields\". \nMALE WASP Lunch! (to Z) A little piece of advice, sport -- bob and weave!  Bob and weave! \nBALA What do you mean? \nMALE WASP Well -- like my father used to say -- there's no such thing as a free meal! \nThe wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and then dashing away again... \nTHE WASPS Excuse me -- I'll have some potato salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if I do!  After you! (etc.) \n-- But all is not well.  We pull back to reveal that Z and Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is attached to a giant sneaker.  Which moves. \nZ I sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently -- \nJust at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground. \nBALA Oh...my...God. \nMALE WASP (shaking her) Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up! \nBut she doesn't move.  The Male Wasp stares up at the sky. \nMALE WASP (heartbroken) WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY???? \nSurprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified... \nFLY (to Z) Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin' to be afraid of! \nZ Yeah, well, I make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead. \nCRICKET Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't judge people by how many arms and legs we've got. \nFLY Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly.  But here, I'm known as... (with attitude) Superfly. \nCRICKET Anyway, big Gus is mellow. \nThe termite sticks his hand out.  A drop of acid drips from his head and splashes at Z's feet. \nZ (taking his hand, disgusted) Charmed. \nZ reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches, smiling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT \nThe insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by the still-red ember of a match.  Platters heaped with food lie untouched as they pat their bellies... \nZ and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they had just met for the first time. \nZ So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night? \nBALA Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. \nZ Well, \"trouble\" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night. \nZ takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in a pocket. \nZ Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else... \nBALA You held onto this all that time? \nZ Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday. (embarrassed) Well, to be honest, I just liked having it. \nHe hands it back to her.  Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly. For a moment Z is shy.  Then he looks at her too.  They're two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss, when -- \nBEETLE Hey Z! \nThe moment is wrecked.  Z looks up.  A chubby beetle stands there with Gus the termite. \nBEETLE Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a thirty foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate! \nZ (annoyed) Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything. \nZ gets up to go with them. \nZ Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why they call you \"pests\"? \nEXT.  INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT \nAs Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast. The tracker ant is going nuts. \nZ looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when -- \nMALE WASP (O.S.) I'll go. \nThe male wasp is hovering nearby. \nZ (surprised) You?! \nMALE WASP I know what it's like to lose someone...I keep hearing the sound of Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take you. \nZ hops on the wasp's back. \nZ Let's go, pal! \nThe wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a little chastized. \nFLY Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING \nThe wasp and Z fly high above the colony... \nZ Wow...I never saw things this way... \nFrom here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the colony...the \"desert\" (an asphalt path) and across it, the \"lake\" (the overflowing water fountain) \nZ Things look so close together from up here...there's the desert...and the lake... (thinking about something) it's not far from the colony at all... \nSuddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air. \nMALE WASP Sorry.  Turbulence. \nINT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nFormica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door. The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other insects. \nAnt Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him. \nFORMICA Princess Bala.  Good. (with urgency) Where's Z? \nBala replies warily. \nBALA He's...he's dead. (covering for Z) You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis. \nFORMICA (regretfully) It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself. \nBALA Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. (sadly) I miss him already. \nFORMICA (surprised) You miss him?  Why? \nBALA (angry) Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. \nThe soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks furious.  Then he just shrugs. \nFORMICA (shaking his head) Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from. I just hope they're not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see Z again after all. \nINT. ANT MOUND - DAY \nElsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots.  When they've gone, Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt...he heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers... \nINT. OUTSIDE FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nZ creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers.  This part of the colony seems to be deserted. \nZ Geez, this place really empties out in August.  Where is everybody? \nZ walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and peeks in the eye socket. \nINT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS \nInside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches \"on\", eyes glowing.  Z enters the chamber cautiously. \nTRACKER ANT (sniffing) Z!  Z!  I smell Z! \nFor a moment, Z's afraid.  Then he sees the small Tracker Ant doesn't seem hostile. \nZ You \"smell\" me?  Well look, I -- I've been out in the wilderness for a while, and -- \nThe tracker ant keeps sniffing.  Z waves his hand in front of the blind ant's eyes. \nZ (getting it) Hey, wait, you're...you're one of those pheremone sniffers, aren't you? Maybe you can help me...I'm looking for a friend of mine, Princess Bala. \nTRACKER ANT (enthusiastic) Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah! \nZ picks up the tracker ant. \nZ Just remember, I met her first. \nZ, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its lead... \nThrough this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more and more insistent...And finally straight to a blank wall. \nTRACKER ANT Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah... \nZ Bala's through there? \nTRACKER ANT Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah... \nZ Great.  More digging.  This is why I left in the first place. \nZ can answer his own question.  He puts down the tracker ant, with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli, starts digging through the wall... \nINT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY \nMeanwhile, A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member, in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it narrows almost to a point.  He's hanging from a winch, and has a little hammer and chisel in his hand.  He's WHISTLING, awaiting instructions. \nINT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY \nZ emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out of his mouth and wipes his hands off.  Nearby, Bala lies there, bound and gagged. \nZ Bala! \nZ unties Bala and undoes her gag. \nThe workers turn to look at him questioningly. \nZ We've got to dig a trench around us! \n-- But one of the workers raises his hands. \nWORKER #1 Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're individuals. \nWORKER #2 Yeah.  We're too important to dig. You taught us that, Z.  You hate digging! \nZ (at his wits end) Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now dig! \nWEAVER You heard the ant -- DIG!!! \nThe workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves, passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the dry ground. \n-- But they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in... \nThe ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby, Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing traffic and encouraging the workers... \nZ That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the center!  Go on! \nNearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish. \nZ Your highness...time to get your hands dirty! \nGingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver. \nThe water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that... \n...the pile of dirt in the middle of the \"island\" created by the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher, reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber... \n...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat, swirling around angrily. \nNow Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they can reach the top -- \nZ We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's DO IT! \nThe workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it, forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up towards the ceiling... \nZ Now climb! \nThe ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever higher towards the top... \nWhere they start to dig through the very ceiling... \n...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo container... \nZ Okay boys -- take her up! \nZ slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those plastic toy monkeys... \nEXT. ANT MOUND - DAY \n...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground, widening the hole... \nINT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nBALA No, I'm Z. \nMore and more ants step forward. \nWORKERS I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my brother!  I've been Z for weeks now! \nQUEEN (regally) We are Z. \nNow, the workers are all shouting the same declaration. \nALL I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z! \nZ is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives the signal. \nFORMICA ATTACK! \nThe army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia alights on the rim of the horizon. \nFLY Hey, guys! \nTHE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon. \nWASP It's them! \nSuddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and now surround the army, dwarfing them. \nWASP Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z? \nFLY Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts. \nThe ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next. Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be bulging out of his face. \nFORMICA What are you doing?!  ATTACK!! (berating his army) Come on, you yellow-bellies! (turning on Carpenter) Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself! \nCARPENTER Uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir... \nFormica turns towards the insects gathered against him.  With his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and CHARGES Z! \nFORMICA AHHHHHHH!! \nFormica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards, slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and then tumbles over. \nFor a moment, it looks as if he's gone. \nFORMICA (O.S.) Help...help me... \nZ goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created, which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes, a new expression crossing his features: fear. \nFORMICA Please...I...I can't swim...Help me... \nFormica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again -- but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long... \nSuddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on him. \nZ I thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter. \nFormica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to realize his error... \n", "test1_input": "Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the colony and runs the other way. \nBALA I'm going!  I'm going' \n...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING in her footsteps. \nZ, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY \nZ and Bala dust themselves off. \nBALA What was that thing? \nZ How should I know? \nBALA I order you to find out where we are! \nZ Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals. \nZ tries to flag down some passing bees. \nZ Excuse me, I -- (it passes him by; he tries the next) Pardon me -- (same response) And they call them social insects. \nBALA Climb up that tree and get a better view! \nBala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down face with Bala. \nBALA I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. \nZ Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot? \nBALA How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! \nZ squares up with her. \nZ Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it? \nBALA Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! \nZ But can there be a society composed of just two ants? \nBALA No!  There's no such thing as \"just two ants.\"  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! \nZ Look around, sweetheart. \nShe looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She glowers at Z. \nBALA I -- hate -- you. \nZ Well I guess that makes us even. \nBALA Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me! \nZ Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker! \n", "test1_true": "Z Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica? \nBALA I didn't choose him.  What kind  of idiot would... (unconvincingly) ...choose who she wanted to marry? \nShe shakes herself out of it. \nBALA Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole! \nZ Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... (he decides) You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia. \nBALA Insectopia?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale! \nZ Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... (he knows that was maybe stretching it) that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg... (looking around) That direction. \nBALA Worker!  Come back here now! \nZ I've got a name.  It's Z. \nBALA That's not a name!  That's just a letter! \nZ, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes through to her. \nWe start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING, CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing her with his beady gaze. \nBALA (clears her throat) Worker? (no response...louder now) Oh WORKER?  Where are you? (getting desperate) Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!! \nBala heads off after Z. \nINT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY \nThe mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel. The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling at them to dig faster. \nAZTECA I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein' yelled at. \nWORKER #1 What do you want, we're just workers. \nWEAVER You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier! \nAZTECA That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly! \nWORKER #2 I heard about this guy. (turning to the other workers) He crashed a party at the palace. Then he took a hike with one of the royal babes!  And when they tried to stop him, he just looked at a couple'a guards, and they burst into flames! \nWORKER ANT #1 You're nuts, how could a worker do all that? \nWEAVER Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca... \nAZTECA Invisible! \nWEAVER No -- an individual! \nWORKER #2 What's that? \nWEAVER Well, it's...someone with his own point of view...someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do! \nAZTECA (eyes lit up, watching Weaver) Someone who follows his heart! \n", "test2_input": "THUD!  They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.  The sneaker rises again... \nBALA (emotional) Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... \nZ (touched) Yes? \nBALA This is all your fault!!! \nThe sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum with a penny). \nZ We're safe... \nJust then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them. \nZ Who the hell is that?!!! \nThe penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker, bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM... \n...and land with a CRASH in total darkness. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nThe \"lake\" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water droplet. \nThe earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the lake - and begins to drink from it.  The creature seems to hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.  It's a Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie. \nTOUGH VOICE (O.S.) Ant Team Six -- take him out! \nThe monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though they're attacking the Death Star! \nThe monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are making a diversionary run... \nand then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy. \nThe monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING! \nThe members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying- ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and land. \nMAJOR MANDIBLE And don't come back, you sissy! \nMAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into frame.  He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier. The rest of his team fan out to search the area. \nMANDIBLE Talk to me. \nCOMMANDO ANT Z and the Princess were here, sir. Signs of a struggle. \nMANDIBLE Let's get a read on that feremone track. \nCOMMANDO ANT #1 (to the others) Get the sniffer! \nTwo other commandoes come running up with what looks like a piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense of smell. \nTRACKER ANT Bala...find Bala... \nThe tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter... \nTRACKER ANT (as he's swivelled) Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no... \n", "test2_true": "COMMANDO ANT #3 Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here! \nMANDIBLE Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing, wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel SCUM! (yelling into the distance) I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE DEAD ANT, MISTER! \nMandible's muscles bulge.  The veins in his head throb.  This is one ass-kicking ant.  Even Mandible's troops look scared of him. \nMANDIBLE Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO! GO!  GO!  GO! \nAnt Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction indicated by the tracker ant. \nINT. TRASH BAG - DAY \nDarkness.  Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala. \nBALA Come on, Z. \nZ Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. \"Insectopia\". \nIn one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little hole through which a shaft of light is falling.  Bala proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and bigger... \nZ (defeated) There's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders. \nBala stops...she notices that they're being watched.  She's emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural assortment of insects are regarding them. \nA laid-back FLY voices their thoughts. \nFLY What's with the bummer attitude? \nA nearby BUTTERFLY joins in. \nBUTTERFLY Yeah -- nobody stresses out in Insectopia! \nBALA Did you say... \nZ (joining Bala) ...Insectopia? \nZ and Bala look around.  Just to get things straight, the garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing it through human eyes.  Instead, we're looking at it through ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land of plenty. \nThe sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic, thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere, insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in that's like an insect version of Woodstock. \nBala and Z are awe-struck.  Bala turns to Z. \nBALA (happily) Z, we made it! \nFLY (alighting on the grapefruit) C'mon in!  The nectar's fine! \nLike a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped tunnel), and is shot out... \nZ Yippeeeeee! \n...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he alternately drinks and swims through... \nDown at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off.  Then he sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE. \nZ (terrified) AAAAAGH!!! \n", "test3_input": "QUEEN Bala! \nBALA Mom! \nZ calls out to the crowd. \nZ Listen up!  We've all got to get out of here!  This place is going to flood! \nThe workers are unconvinced. \nWORKER #1 Are you nuts? \nZ You've got to believe me! \nWORKER #2 Oh yeah?  What makes you so special, Mr. Know-It-All? \nZ I'm Z. \nThe workers are even more sceptical.  A laugh goes up from the crowd. \nWORKER #3 You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten milimeters tall! \nWORKER #4 -- and he can kill termites with his bare hands!  You're just some scrawny worker with a mental problem! \nZ I am Z! \nWORKER #1 No you're not! \nWEAVER Yes he is. \nWeaver steps out of the crowd. \nZ Weaver! \nWeaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry. \nWORKERS Hey...it is Z...listen to what he says! [etc]. \nWEAVER Z...I'm so sorry!  I -- \nZ Don't worry about it, pal. \nNearby, Bala and the Queen hug.  The Queen looks over at Z. \nQUEEN (distastefully) Oh...it's that social-climbing worker again -- what does he want? \nZ (in response) To save you all!  Now we've got to go! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANT MOUND - DAY \nOutside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army, gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his throat... \nMANDIBLE (talking into his antenna) Let 'er rip! \nINT. SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY \n", "test3_true": "Then... \nTHE WALL BURSTS OPEN. \nAnd a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes... \nINT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY \nEveryone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the tunnel -- \nAZTECA Listen! \nWORKER #1 He's right!!! \nFrom here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them... \nZ LET'S MOVE IT! \nAll of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's bearers drop her and scramble over her. \nQUEEN You there!  Stop!  I say! \nThe Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted against the white-capped torrent of water... \n...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she passes some of her bearers on the way... \nAnd then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into all of its side tunnels, as we see: \nA group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand slapping a table... \nAnother group, the members of which are getting swallowed up one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while but eventually he, too is swallowed up... \n-- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant babies... \nIn one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a LIVING DAM.  It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating them up... \nAnd we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN CENTER - DAY \nThe huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the Queen -- have run to. \nThe chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water flows out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters rise around them. \nAZTECA There's no way out! \nQUEEN We're all going to drown!!! \nBALA Z...what can we do? \nZ clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he shouts... \nZ Dig! \n"}

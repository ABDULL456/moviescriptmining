{"test1_input": "BALA Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom. (concerned) Do I look fat to you? \nHANDMAIDEN #2 (knowingly, to Handmaiden #2) Pre-wedding jitters. \nHANDMAIDEN #1 You just need to blow off some steam. Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club! \nBALA The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different. \nHANDMAIDEN #2 There isn't anyplace else -- (making a joke) Except the worker bar. \nBALA The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! \nThe handmaidens look shocked. \nHANDMAIDEN #1 But -- we can't -- there'll be workers there. \nINT. ANT BAR - NIGHT \nA long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier. \nZ We declared war again? (off Weaver's nod) Are you scared? \nWEAVER (shrugs) I'll be back. \nThe BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids. \nAPHIDS (as they're slapped on bar) Ouch!  Ouch! \nBARTENDER Two aphid beers. \nZ (as Bartender leaves) Did you see that?  How he gave you the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers. \nWEAVER I don't know what you're talking about, Z. \nZ Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them. \nWEAVER Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes. \nWe can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of \"Worker Babes\", including Z's friend Azteca. \nZ Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. (sighs) No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me. \nWEAVER Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. (quaffing his aphid beer) Don't you want your aphid beer? \nZ I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy. \nWEAVER Z, we've known each other a long time, right? \nZ Of course.  You were born two seconds after me. \nWEAVER And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow. \nZ Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid. \nDown the bar, there's a commotion.  A grizzled old SCOUT ant has had too much to drink. \nDRUNK SCOUT Have you been to Insectopia?  Have you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I have... (becoming emotional) ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles -- all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...No rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there... (howling drunkenly) It's Insectopia!  Insectopia! \n", "test1_true": "DRUNK SCOUT I was cut off from my unit -- found it by mistake -- (slurring) It changed my life! (spraying another soldier with saliva) You see -- ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white -- \nSOLDIERS You've had enough for one night! Come on, Gramps, before you get in trouble. \nThe soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out. \nZ (excited) Hey, did you hear what he said?! \nWEAVER Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions. \nMUSIC STARTS UP. \nINT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nPrincess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens. \nHANDMAIDEN #2 We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper! \nBALA I'm the Princess, aren't I? \nHANDMAIDEN #2 Of course -- \nBALA And do Princesses do improper things? \nHANDMAIDEN #2 Of course not -- \nBALA Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. \nShe adjusts her \"disguise\", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.- style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf. \nBALA I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day! \nMusic starts.  An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the dance floor. \nBARKER (on loudspeaker) Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and that means it's time to dance. \nEvery ant gets up to dance.  Weaver turns to Z. \nWEAVER (draining his beer) Time to cut a rug, Z! \nZ I'm not in the mood. (disgusted) Even when they're off work, they follow orders. \nWEAVER Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper. \nWeaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance.  The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone -- all the ants already know the steps.  Everyone dances in perfect synch. \nBARKER (southern twang) And a left-right-quarterstep-back step-halfstep -- a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep -- a left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep -- \nAT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens. \nBALA I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me! \nHANDMAIDEN #1 But General Formica would be furious! \nBALA (enjoying the idea) I know. \n", "test1_id": 1146, "test2_input": "The handmaidens are appalled.  Bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on -- \nZ, who's watching the other ants dance. \nZ What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- \nBALA Wanna dance? \nBala's standing right there.  Z is instantly smitten. \nZ Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean -- (regaining suavosity) Just let me finish my beer. \nNot breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely. Reaches suavely for a beer.  Suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face. \nHe plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her. \nZ So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before? \nBALA (covering up) I work in the palace, I don't get out much. \nZ The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding -- \nBALA (shocked) What? \nZ and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but Z can't do any of the steps. \nZ Now, let's see, I -- it's been a while since I -- I think you -- \nBala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions. \nZ Here, I'll lead. \nZ starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive. \nBALA Are you sure this is a real dance? \nZ Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- \nBALA (surprised) Really? \nZ Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow. \nBALA You're right! \nZ (surprised) You -- you think I'm right? \nBALA Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! \nBala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's back at the moment. \nSOLDIER Hey!  Watch your step, worker. \nZ has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE, glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off. \nBALA You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! \nZ (terrified) Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. (whispering to Bala) Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble! (ineptly trying to placate the soldier) You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- \n", "test2_true": "Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile. \nSOLDIER How come you don't dance like the rest of us? \nZ glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly... \nZ Because -- because I'm an individual! \nSOLDIER #2 An individual?  Never heard of it. \nMANDIBLE You look like a worker to me. \nWEAVER Hey, lay off my little buddy! \nZ, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess' handmaidens hurries over. \nHANDMAIDEN #1 Princess Bala!  Princess Bala! \nZ, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears. \nZ Princess?  You're a Princess? \nHANDMAIDEN #2 The police are coming! \nBALA Uh oh. (to Z) Goodbye!  Gotta run! \nZ Wait!  When can I see you again? \nBALA Let me think.  Hmmnn... (thinks) Never.  Bye! \nBala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd. \nZ Wait!  Princess!  Wait! \nBut she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY \nZ is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war. Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by. \nWEAVER Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident! \nZ Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign! \nWEAVER It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is? \nZ What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... (wags his eyebrows suggestively) tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content! \nWeaver looks unconvinced. \nZ You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you! \nWEAVER (thinks) I can't think of any. \n", "test2_id": 1147, "test3_input": "Z looks disheartened.  He's about to leave when -- \nMALE WASP (O.S.) I'll go. \nThe male wasp is hovering nearby. \nZ (surprised) You?! \nMALE WASP I know what it's like to lose someone...I keep hearing the sound of Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take you. \nZ hops on the wasp's back. \nZ Let's go, pal! \nThe wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a little chastized. \nFLY Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING \nThe wasp and Z fly high above the colony... \nZ Wow...I never saw things this way... \nFrom here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the colony...the \"desert\" (an asphalt path) and across it, the \"lake\" (the overflowing water fountain) \nZ Things look so close together from up here...there's the desert...and the lake... (thinking about something) it's not far from the colony at all... \nSuddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air. \nMALE WASP Sorry.  Turbulence. \nINT. FORMICA'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nFormica sits at his desk, going over some plans.  Formica's chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door. The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other insects. \nAnt Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying the struggling and kicking Bala.  One of the commandoes sets the tracker ant one the floor...then Formica gets up from his desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him. \nFORMICA Princess Bala.  Good. (with urgency) Where's Z? \nBala replies warily. \nBALA He's...he's dead. (covering for Z) You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis. \nFORMICA (regretfully) It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself. \nBALA Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. (sadly) I miss him already. \nFORMICA (surprised) You miss him?  Why? \nBALA (angry) Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. \nThe soldiers look shocked.  For a moment, Formica looks furious.  Then he just shrugs. \nFORMICA (shaking his head) Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from. I just hope they're not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see Z again after all. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY \nZ hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance to the colony. \nMALE WASP Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect, you're alright by me. \nZ Thanks, Chip. \nThey shake hands and the wasp flies off. \nZ (to himself) How am I going to get in?  The place is crawling with soldiers! \nZ starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a couple of SOLDIER ANTS. \nSOLDIER ANT You there!  Worker! \nZ's caught -- it's over.  He turns around with his hands up. \nZ Don't bite!  I surrender! \nSOLDIER ANT What are you doing out here!  All workers are to remain inside the colony, by orders of General Formica! \nZ can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued. \nZ (heading inside) Well...if you insist... \nINT. MEGATUNNEL - DAY \nThe Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be cut. \nQUEEN Very impressive, General. \nBehind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded, looking confused and expectant.  Some of them clutch little flags and noisemakers... \nMANDIBLE Wave that flag, you maggot! \n...which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six. \nFORMICA Is there anything wrong, your majesty? \nThe Queen is looking around unhappily. \nQUEEN It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish she were here for this special moment. \nFormica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder. \nFORMICA (falsely supportive) She is, your majesty.  She is. \nThe CAMERA heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see... \nINT. MID SKYLIGHT TUNNEL \nBala, tied and gagged.

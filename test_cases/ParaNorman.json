{"test1_input": "NORMAN Yes. I know. I was told not to talk to you. Sorry. Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to Norman and whispering conspiratorially. \nMR PRENDERGHAST And you know why you're not supposed to talk to me? Norman tries to back away. \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) I can see ghosts too! And I know that's not all you've been seeing lately, is it? Bad omens? Things you can't quite explain? Strange faces peering through the veil? Norman's eyes widen further. ParaNorman 15. \n17 CONTINUED: 17 \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) And I'll bet no one told you about the witch's curse, did they? \nNORMAN Actually, we're learning about it in school..? \nNEIL \n(BEAMING PROUDLY) I'm a tree! Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and leans close to Norman. \nMR PRENDERGHAST There's something you really need to know! This is the most important thing you will ever hear! The fate of everyone depends on it! Now listen close... The witch's curse is real, and you're the one who has to stop it! Mr Prenderghast grabs Norman's arm and leans closer. \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) You've gotta use your gift of talking to the dead! He breaks into a HACKING COUGH, face turning beet red and bloodshot eyes bulging. \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) Because if you don't the witch's ghost... \n(COUGHING) And this is the most important thing of all... You have to go up to the old graveyard and... \nNEIL (O.S.) Leave him alone! An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Don't make me throw this hummus! It's spicy! Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the scene. He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman. ParaNorman 16. \n17 CONTINUED: (2) 17 \nMR PRENDERGHAST This ain't done with! You'll see it soon enough! Watch for the sign! As he hobbles away, Neil peers down the street after the old man. \nNEIL Jeez, what a dirty old creep! \nNORMAN He's my uncle. \nNEIL So is it true? \nNORMAN What? Norman just stares at him. \nNEIL Can you see ghosts? Like, everywhere? All the time? \nNORMAN Uh, yeah? \nNEIL Awesome! Do you think you can see my dog Bub? He was run over by an animal rescue van. Tragic and ironic. We buried him in the yard. Could you see him? Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback. \nNORMAN Maybe. \nNEIL Sweet! Come on! \n", "test1_true": "Neil forcibly drags Norman up the front driveway of a pastel-painted house. A pair of legs spotted in oil stick out from beneath a pimped-up camper van. Neil's brother MITCH calls out from under the van. \nMITCH Neil? That you? ParaNorman 17. \n20 CONTINUED: 20 \nNEIL Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play with the dead dog in the garden and we're not even gonna have to dig him up first! Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round flip-flops. \nMITCH What'd you say? Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman, who stands awkwardly a little way away, surrounded by cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Neil, isn't he that weird kid? Y'know, \"Look at me, I talk to ghosts so people will pay attention to me.\" Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically. \nNEIL Can you stop doing that? It's kinda stupid. \nMITCH Now listen to me, you don't need to be hanging out with weird people. That's a tip. Neil scowls at his brother. \nNEIL Don't blow this for me, Mitch. This one's not weird. He talks to dead people. Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his brother. \nEXT. NEIL'S GARDEN - LATER \nNeil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard, surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn ornaments. Norman stands slightly to one side surveying the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should have gone straight home after all. \nNEIL He's around here somewhere... \n(A BEAT) So does everyone come back as a ghost? ParaNorman 18. \n21 CONTINUED: 21 Norman hesitates. This level of interest is new to him. \nNORMAN No. My grandma told me it's usually people who still have stuff to figure out. Or sometimes it's the ones who died suddenly, or in a bad way. A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly into two halves. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) Bub? \nNEIL Is he there? How's he look? Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs behind to sniff his own backside. \nNORMAN Uh... good. Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby calves, then doubles back for another try. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) He's happy to see you. \nNEIL \n(\"DOGGY\" VOICE) Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy! \n(TO NORMAN) Can he feel it if I pet him? \nNORMAN Yeah, I guess. Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making a \"coochy-coo\" face. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) Uh... that's not his chin. Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up. Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him. \n", "test1_id": 1404, "test2_input": "NEIL Go get it! \nNORMAN He can't fetch it, y'know. ParaNorman 19. \n21 CONTINUED: (2) 21 \nNEIL Yeah well, it's still fun. Good boy! Bring it back! Go get it, Bub! Good boy! CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his feet and he bends down to pick it up. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Why don't you try? \nNORMAN `Cos I don't really, uh... You can go. \nNEIL No, no, it's fun! Try it! \nNORMAN No I don't want to. \nNEIL You throw it. It's really easy. \nNORMAN No it's okay. You can throw it. \nNEIL No, c'mon, it's really fun. \nNORMAN Here. You go first. \nNEIL No, you try it. I already went like fifty times. \nNORMAN Okay, what do I do? \nNEIL You get the stick, you pull it back, and you throw it! \nNorman throws it and accidentally hits Neil in the head, knocking him over. \nNORMAN Neil? Sorry! As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth. \nNEIL I fetched it! ParaNorman 20. \n21 CONTINUED: (3) 21 CLOSE ON NORMAN, as a smile creeps across his face and he starts to LAUGH. \nNORMAN Are you okay? CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play, the sun above them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky. \nINT. MR PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT \nPANTING and WHEEZING, Mr Prenderghast staggers into his study, SLAMS the door behind him and heads for his desk. \nMR PRENDERGHAST I'll show him, and that scary little fat kid... He shakily rummages around the collected papers and trinkets, and pulls out the leather bound book, all the time GRUMBLING crazily. \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) Doesn't he realize we're running out of t... With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest, then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with a THUMP. Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of him, sculpting his shape in the air. With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit back in, and he staggers back to his feet. \nMR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) No! Not yet! Not yet! He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down onto the ground. The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body. He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body lying at his feet. \n", "test2_true": "29 EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT 29 \nLit by spotlights, a large banner over the entrance reads, \"THE WITCH'S CURSE - presented by BLITHE HOLLOW MIDDLE SCHOOL DRAMA SOCIETY - written, produced and directed for the stage by Margot Henscher\". A notice beneath it reads \"SPELLING BEE - NEXT WENSDAY\". A chorus of kids' voices can be heard SINGING from inside, belting out an operatic rendition of Donovan's \"Season of the Witch\". \nINT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - SAME \nRows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are occupied by expectant families. Among the sea of faintly buzzing video cameras, and a ripple of APPLAUSE, Sandra politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples' children. Next to her, Perry struggles to fit a battery into his camera. \nPERRY BABCOCK Great, now we'll never get to remember this moment. ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her hands theatrically at the other children. \nSALMA I curse you accusers to die a horrible and gruesome death and rise from your graves as the living dead; your souls doomed to an eternity of damnation! The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and begin a slow ominous chant. \nKIDS Kill the witch! Kill the witch! Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the stage. \nSANDRA BABCOCK Gosh, aren't they adorable? Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams of the gymnasium. Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS. ParaNorman 22. \n30 CONTINUED: 30 He looks down from it and catches Neil's eye. Neil makes a puzzled expression. \nNEIL What? \nKIDS Kill the witch! Kill the witch! The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows dark and thick. The shapes of the audience and the kids beside him swim around, blurring like a finger pulled through oil paint. The ceiling disintegrates into clouds, which CRACKLE with lightning. \nNORMAN (under his breath) Oh no! Not again! All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and through the darkness in the distance are occasional lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot looked three centuries ago. \nEXT. OLD FOREST - NIGHT \nAs Norman turns on the spot GASPING, he hears a RUSTLE in the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth. \nPURITAN Witch! We know you're out there! Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly, and the figure turns around and points at him. \nPURITAN (CONT'D) There! \nNORMAN No! \nPURITAN Witch. More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding hayforks. They SHOUT threateningly and, as one man, surge toward him. Norman turns and runs. The trees around him are shifting, but there's no wind blowing the branches. Limbs GROAN as they twist, bearing down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape. Soon he can run no further, the way ahead tangled up into a wall of thorny fingers. ParaNorman 23. \n31 CONTINUED: 31 Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a huge tree, and a knothole grimaces at him, wood splitting open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and speaks in a low rumbling voice. \nTREE The dead are coming! Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the pursuing figures are drawing closer, and there's no escape. A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere. \nNEIL (O.S.) Hey buddy! Are you okay? Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS. \nINT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT \nNorman stands next to Neil on stage, eyes closed and WAILING. Everyone around him stares in stunned silence as, still SCREAMING, he runs into the spotlight. \nNORMAN \n", "test2_id": 1405, "test3_input": "SALMA So Norman, let me get this straight; you guys all go on this big supernatural adventure and you're calling me in the middle of the night because you need someone to help you do your homework? \nINTERCUT KIDS IN THE VAN/SALMA Norman talks into his cell phone, occasionally ducking as Neil's flailing limbs are shaken from side to side by the GROWLING upside down zombie hanging above their heads. \nNORMAN Uh... yeah. \nEXT. WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nHooper steers her bike closer and swings her backside into the side of the van in an attempt to ram it off the road. The van lurches, flipping the Judge up and over the front of the vehicle, planting his face with a SQUELCH against the windscreen. \nINT. MITCH'S VAN - CONTINUOUS \nNeil drops back down onto his seat. The Dead Judge's arm, torn off at the shoulder, is still clutched in his hands. He stares down at it, wide-eyed, as it wriggles like an animal in his grasp. The Dead Judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the van with a dull SQUEAK. \nCOURTNEY Mitch, do something! Mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers, which wipe the zombie's rotten flesh from side to side across the glass. Mitch and Courtney's eyes follow the Judge's movements from side to side. ParaNorman 52. \n77 CONTINUED: 77 Behind them, Neil SQUEALS as the dismembered arm crawls all over him, fingers scuttling like a spider's legs. The arm frees itself from Neil and turns on Norman, leaping at him like a viper. Norman holds the book up as a shield, and manages to swat the zombie arm away, flipping it across the front seat, where it lands on the back of Mitch's neck. Mitch SCREAMS as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top of his head, and madly tries to shake it off. It hangs onto him grimly, bony fingers hooked around his nostrils. With Mitch no longer steering, the van swerves crazily across the road, shaking the Dead Judge off the windscreen. He disappears under the front of the vehicle, his one remaining arm clinging onto the underside. \nINTERCUT KIDS IN THE VAN/SALMA Norman shouts pleadingly into the phone as he and Neil are flung violently from side to side across the back seat. \nNORMAN Salma! We need to find out where the witch is buried! I went to the old graveyard but her grave wasn't there! \nSALMA Well, duh. People found guilty of witchcraft weren't considered people anymore. Norman, your witch was buried someplace else... in an unmarked grave! \n(REPROACHFULLY) If you cared to pay attention some of the time, you would know that we covered this in fifth grade history class. \nNORMAN Salma! Please! Hurry! Y'know, I would Google this myself if there wasn't a 300 year old dead guy trying to rip my face off! With a SIGH, Salma types at her computer. \nSALMA Okay. It says here she was tried in the old Town Hall on Main Street. There may be a record of her execution and burial in their archives. ParaNorman 53. \n77 CONTINUED: (2) 77 Norman listens intently then shouts over to Mitch, still struggling with the zombie hand gripping his face. \nNORMAN Quick! She said go to the Town Hall! \nEXT. WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nMitch hangs a sharp right and accelerates off the road and into thick undergrowth, sending up showers of twigs and thorns. Close on his heels, Hooper swerves her bike around in pursuit. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT \nThe six zombies inexorably continue their march, breaking cover from outlying woodland into the suburban streets of the town proper. At the bottom of a long driveway, spotlit by a street lamp, Mrs Henscher is taking out the trash in her bathrobe. She looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach. Her face is caked in a terrifying green avocado face mask. Barely a few feet in front of her, a similarly green face stares back, only this one has been dead for three hundred years. Henscher SCREAMS, bolting down the street like a runaway locomotive. \nEXT. WOODS, MITCH'S VAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe van ploughs through bracken and bushes at breakneck speed. A little way behind, Hooper careens precariously in the van's wake. \nINT. MITCH'S VAN - CONTINUOUS \nMitch finally manages to pry the Dead Judge's arm off his head. He throws it, thrashing around violently, over his shoulder. Alvin lifts his face tentatively over the edge of the back seat to see what's going on. The zombie arm plants him in the eye, sending both sprawling against the floor. Alvin SQUEALS as the arm snakes around his neck into a bizarre approximation of a wrestling hold. ParaNorman 54. \n", "test3_true": "Mitch swerves his van down the hill toward the more affluent suburbs of the town. Hooper's police bike bounces along behind them, red light flashing and SIREN wailing. \nINT. STATION WAGON, NEARBY ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nPerry and Sandra Babcock are driving home from their evening out. Neither look especially happy. \nSANDRA BABCOCK I really think it might help if you tried to see things from his point of view. \nPERRY BABCOCK I don't want to. \nINT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS \nThe Babcocks' discussion continues as they drive. \nSANDRA BABCOCK Perry, not believing in the Afterlife is like not believing in Astrology. \nPERRY BABCOCK I have no idea what you're talking about. Seriously, where did you learn that? \nSANDRA BABCOCK Calm down. Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nMitch's van explodes out of the thinning woods and back on to the winding hill road. Hooper careens through the trees behind it, but fails to make the turn and smashes through a fence across the other side of the road into a suburban back yard, splinters of fence showering down in her wake. Scattering lawn ornaments, plastic garden toys and deck furniture, Hooper rides directly up a kids' slide, shooting high up into the air like a rocket. ParaNorman 55. \n87 EXT. SUBURBAN INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS 87 \nPreceded by an ear-splittingly guttural WAIL, Mrs Henscher runs through the streets, waving her arms about hysterically. Moments later, the Babcocks' station wagon pulls around the corner. \nEXT. SUBURBAN INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS \nMitch's van SCREECHES through the intersection, swerving in front of the Babcock's station wagon, which veers wildly as Perry brakes hard. He leaps out of the car as the van drives away. \nPERRY BABCOCK Delinquent drivers! Where are the police when you need them? Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the hood of the station wagon with a CRUNCH. Before Perry can react he is buried under the mass of Sheriff Hooper, dropping like a meteorite onto his head. \nINT. MITCH'S VAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe kids, hanging on for dear life, hear a loud CRUNCH from the back of the van. They all turn to see the van's rear doors ripped open. Silhouetted in the space is the one-armed Dead Judge, cape muddied and torn from his crawling back out from the vehicle's undercarriage. The zombie lunges toward the startled kids, and MOANS. Mitch turns his attention back to the road ahead, but too late, and he YELLS as green-faced Mrs Henscher runs SQUEALING into the van's headlights. Mitch throws all his weight onto the wheel, tires SCREAMING as the van misses Henscher by inches. The violence of the turn flings the Dead Judge backwards like a slingshot, disappearing out of the doors and shattering into a dozen pieces as he SMASHES into the hard road. \nEXT. SUBURBAN BACK YARDS - CONTINUOUS \nHaving completely lost control, Mitch's van ploughs through cookie-cutter back yards. ParaNorman 56. \n90 CONTINUED: 90 It bounces down the hill, flipping over and over, the kids inside tossed around like rag dolls. Somewhat the worse for wear, it eventually comes to a stop in a parking lot, neatly crashing into an empty space. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nThe kids clamber out of the far side of the van. \n", "test3_id": 1406}

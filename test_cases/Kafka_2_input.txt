SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch Kafka!  A GAUNT MAN inside. 
GAUNT MAN You've killed him!  Like a dog! 
Kafka dropped his lantern in surprise, and shrinks back, CRUNCHING glass. 
GAUNT MAN -- They won't like that.  Not a bit! 
KAFKA I didn't -- 
The inhabitants of the other cells start RATTLING their bars and beseeching Kafka.  He looks around, bewildered and horrified.  Hideous faces looking back at him. 
GAUNT MAN You'll incriminate the rest of us! Let me out too! 
Shuddering, Kafka is moving away, making it through the shocking gauntlet, toward the door at the other end. 
HORRIBLE VOICES Help us! -- release us! 
GAUNT MAN (yelling above the din) You're in the bowels now, my friend! You've thrown yourself in it now! 
A HAGGARD MAN who may have had his tongue cut out gestures desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells. Kafka starts to tentatively reach for it -- when there's a sudden SHRIEK beside him.  He whirls to see, behind more bars, the raving, convoluted face of the creature that stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone completely) -- BANGING violently against his door. 
GAUNT MAN Let me out -- I'm all right -- they haven't treated me yet!  We can go together! 
But now the evil Mr. Pick appears at the end of the passage from which Kafka came -- a gun in his hand. 
MR. PICK You! 
Kafka yanks the lever and runs away.  Mr. Pick FIRES after him, starting to chase -- but the prisoners are coming out of their cells -- coming for him. 
CUT: 
SPIRAL STONE STAIRWELL 
Kafka runs upwards, around and around and around. 
ANOTHER FLOOR 
Here is a part of the Castle Kafka can understand -- office workers toiling away.  Kafka walks past one long row of them, SCRIBES sitting at a single endless desk.  They look like students under examination, hunched over their writing, a virtual conveyor belt of paperwork. 
In the center of this floor is an actual conveyor -- a chain pulley running slowly up and down, presumably throughout the entire Castle, through small holes in the floor and ceiling. There are little pockets on the chain which the clerks continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into. 
The ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry.  He takes it over to a sink with three taps -- Hot, Cold -- and the third one he turns -- Ink. 
CUT: 
CORRIDOR 
Kafka passes a FRIENDLY CLERK. 
FRIENDLY CLERK Are you lost? 
Kafka nearly laughs at the enormity of the question. 
KAFKA I'm, uh, looking for the Medical Records Section. 
Pause. 
FRIENDLY CLERK Oh, you're miles away.  From here you'll want to go left, left again, right, right again, left then right, right then left, and take the Blue Staircase. 
KAFKA Thank you. 
FRIENDLY CLERK (going on his way) -- I haven't seen you here before. 
KAFKA No ... 
KAFKA 
He stands there, a man in a suit with a briefcase in an antiseptic corridor.

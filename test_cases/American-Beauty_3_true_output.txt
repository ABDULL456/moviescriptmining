RICKY Okay. 
He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. She doesn't look away. 
ANGELA Well, whatever. (to Jane) This is boring. Let's go. 
JANE (to Ricky) Do you need a ride? 
ANGELA (to Jane) Are you crazy? I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere. 
RICKY It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks. 
ANGELA Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway. C'mon, let's go. 
Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow. Ricky smiles at her. She almost smiles back, then: 
JANE (calls off to Angela) I think I'm going to walk, too. 
Angela stops and stares at her. 
ANGELA What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.

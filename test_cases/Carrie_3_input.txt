Carrie knits her brow, and flex, the window closes. 
Margaret whips around, facing Carrie. 
CARRIE I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here. 
Flex. 
The SOUND of a window shutting in another room. 
MARGARET Witch! 
Flex. 
Another window. 
MARGARET (continuing) It's Satan's power. First he entered your father, carried him off... 
CARRIE He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that. 
Flex. 
A couple of windows. 
MARGARET The devil tempted him. 
CARRIE He ran away with a woman, Momma. 
MARGARET All men are the same. That boy, he's like all the rest, he doesn't ­ 
Flex. 
The rest of the windows in the house THUNDER shut. 
CARRIE I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
155 & 156 OMITTED 
157 EXT. ROAD ­ NIGHT 
Leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo ­ a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT ­ trailing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance. 
DE LOIS Hell of a risk for a joke. 
Trennant giggles inanely. Billy stops and glares at De Lois. 
BILLY You want out? 
DE LOIS (hastily) No, uh-uh. (then) It's a good joke, Billy. 
Trennant giggles again. 
Garson is stoned silly ­ zonked, deadpan. He greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes. 
De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers. 
DE LOIS (continuing) Hey, piggie... 
Trennant just giggles inanely. 
Another long beat, then: 
DE LOIS (continuing) You sure Old Man Henty won't be around? 
CHRIS I told you. He's at a funeral. 
Trennant explodes into a fit of high-pitched laughter. 
BILLY Shut up, Henry. 
DE LOIS Whose funeral did he go to? 
BILLY His mother's. 
DE LOIS His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God! 
Trennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start laughing, too. Even De Lois starts laughing. 
The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting: 
DE LOIS (continuing) The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look. 
Garson drops one of the pails on the ground. 
BILLY Asshole. 
The sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
158 CHRIS'S POV ­ THE HOG PEN 
And OVERLAPS INTO the harmonic chanting of De Lois, Trennant and Garson:

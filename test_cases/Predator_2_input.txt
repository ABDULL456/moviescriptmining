The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement through the trees.

Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in, shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is gone. 
With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit of the Hunter. 
SCHAEFER Mac! 
Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203, slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy. 
SCHAEFER (to Billy) Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take the girl and get the hell out of here! 
He turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest. 
DILLON No way, Dutch.  I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here. 
SCHAEFER This isn't your style, Dillon. 
DILLON Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch.  Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right.  Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along. 
SCHAEFER You know you can't win this one. 
Dillon stares at him. 
DILLON You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to quit. 
Dillon turns and begins to move out.

SCHAEFER Dillon! 
Dillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell. 
SCHAEFER I'll see you there. 
DILLON Right behind you. 
Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath. 
BILLY He's busted up, bad, Major. 
RAMIREZ (gasping) I can make it, Major. 
Schaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him. 
SCHAEFER Come on, Poncho, we're getting out of here. (to Billy) Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.  Come on! 
119     EXT. MAC - DAY                                       119 
Creeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through the trees. 
MAC (whispered) Come on, you motherfucker! 
120     EXT. DILLON - DAY                                    120 
Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source of the movement. 
He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

VOICE (o.s.) Dillon, over here. 
Dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it.

WIDE on Jimmy as he throws his Backpack into his trunk, climbs into his Piece-of-Shit, and sits, reflecting. 
INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- LATER 
Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging down over the steering wheel so that he can read it. Jimmy's CELL PHONE rings. 
JIMMY (over the wind and music) Yeah, it's Jimmy! 
MATT (O.S.) (barely audible) Hey Jimmy, it's Matt. I need some K. 
Jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver-side window. 
JIMMY Matt?!   Speak up, man, I can barely hear you! 
INT. MATT'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
MATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously. 
MATT (semi-whispering) I need some K, dude. I need it for tonight. 
We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. 
JIMMY (still rolling up the window) What?! 
MATT (semi-whispering) Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home! I need some K, dude! 
JIMMY Alright, alright! I got it, man,      got plenty! I'll see you tonight! 
Jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window. The cell phone begins ringing again. Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the window back up. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Yeah, it's Jimmy! 
We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud, as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride. 
MATT Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need one a' your special deliveries - I won't be around tonight! 
JIMMY Alright, man, when do you need it?! 
MATT Like, now, dude! For tonight!     I'm taking off! 
JIMMY Matt, you're way out of the way, man! Wait for another delivery. 
MATT Look, I need it now, man!     Now now now! I'm takin' off! 
JIMMY What's the rush?! 
MATT (finally confiding) Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang her easy if I had some K. 
JIMMY Really?! 
MATT Easy, dude, easy.    Setzer's words - it's in the bag. 
Jimmy's eyes get very wide. 
JIMMY Jesus! 
Jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left. Too late. Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the passenger seat fly to the floor. 
EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another CAR of equal value parked in front of a STOP SIGN in an otherwise empty intersection. The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs. 
INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have instinctively reached to hold back a child. His Cell Phone starts ringing again. He slowly begins to stir. 
EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS 
The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car. A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy. 
DAVE Jimmy? (still dazed, but immediately friendly) Hey, what's up, man? 
Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his vehicle. 
JIMMY Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the stop sign, I guess. 
DAVE Don't sweat it. (regarding his Car) I could give a shit about this thing. I was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin' hit me. 
Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks toward her, with Dave following. 
JIMMY Holy shit, man, is she alright? 
Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless, bleeding noticeably from the forehead. 
DAVE She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is. 
JIMMY What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta get her to a hospital. 
DAVE Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a problems if we do that. Cops, insurance and whatnot. You probably got drugs on you... 
JIMMY Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's bleedin' all over the place! 
DAVE Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.

CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME 
Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table. 
Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him. 
Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. 
As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. 
Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK. 
Beat. 
They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak. 
MORGAN (soft) He wanted to kill Bo. 
Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son. 
GRAHAM Did he hurt you? 
Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him up in his arms. 
GRAHAM (whispers in his ear) I'm so sorry Morgan. 
Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both his children as they cry in his arms. 
He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food. 
MERRILL I used a little Tabasco in the potato salad. 
Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym. 
BO Houdini's sick. 
GRAHAM Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed.  Make sure the knot's tight. 
Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He nods. 
The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. 
Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. 
The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING 
Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. 
GRAHAM They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there. (beat) At least it got them to sleep. 
Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little. 
GRAHAM Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one for you... What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field... and what would scare every animal in this county? (beat) Have you figured it out yet? (smiles) You probably have... (beat) Give me a hint Colleen... Is it bigger than a bread box? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT 
The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight. 
A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND. 
THEY SUDDENLY STOP. 
AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is five inches away from his face. 
Graham gets startled. 
GRAHAM What's the matter?

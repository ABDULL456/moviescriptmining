He enters. Immediately, he brings his hand to his mouth and coughs violently. 
SHERIFF STORCH Every time I come in here this place gets worse. Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water. 
EARL Yeah, but business gets better. That's the trade off. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 53. 
SHERIFF STORCH Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't cite you for being a public health hazard. Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl finally looks up, confused. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) Mockingbird Trail. 
EARL Mockingbird Trail, what? -- Oh, right, Miss Hills. What happened? She left?

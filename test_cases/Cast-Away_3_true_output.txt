EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI, Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone. 
EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY 
CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck glistens with a thin layer of sweat. 
CHUCK My guess is we're talking fuel filters here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these jitneys get in the mountains, their engines cut out. 
FERNANDO That could lose us half an hour. 
CHUCK Easy.  Each way. 
His beeper goes off. 
INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck is on the phone. 
CHUCK So it finally turned up... 
Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch. 
CHUCK I'll catch the sweep tonight. 
INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT 
Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY 
Christmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm. 
INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY 
The staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box. 
CHUCK It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what -- 
ALEKSEI Six kilometers.  Four miles. 
CHUCK So how are we going to get this place shaped up? 
There's a muttered chorus of answers. 
CHUCK There's only one way.  We have to work together.  Every one of us depends on everyone else.  If one package is late, we are all late.  If one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. Let's start by taking a look around. 
Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard. Chuck stops. 
CHUCK Here, this table is too far from the wall.  Packages can slip down...like... (pulls out a package from behind a table) ...this. 
He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside. 
CHUCK What could be in here?  Let's say one of you sent it.  Could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive.  I don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table. 
The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says something to the Translator. 
TRANSLATOR He says they have been very busy.  It is hard to get good employees.  He is sure you understand. 
Wrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei appears with a cellular phone. 
ALEKSEI Phone call.  Malaysia. 
Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so. 
CHUCK Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them. 
He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin board as he talks. 
CHUCK I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L. right now.  The belts are too small for the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. Look, it's -- 
Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse. Then he notices something over by one of the trucks. 
CHUCK (to a loader) Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its own container! (back on the phone) -- three in the afternoon there, right? That gives you five hours until the sweep comes through.  Do the sort by hand tonight, then put in a new feeder belt, say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime is authorized. 
He hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew. 
CHUCK I'm going out on every route, I'm going to work every job here, until I know enough to help you.  That's it. 
The crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a corner of his command persona slip. 
ALEKSEI It's bad. 
CHUCK Worse than Warsaw. 
ALEKSEI Nobody remembers that. 
CHUCK The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls. 
INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep his balance. 
CHUCK You sorted your packages before you left. None of the other drivers did. 
The Translator and Lev exchange a few words. 
TRANSLATOR He says he wants to be organized.  Do packages in order.

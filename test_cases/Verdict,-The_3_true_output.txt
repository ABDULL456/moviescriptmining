A legal document. LIST OF PROSPECTIVE JURORS. DEBORAH ANN KAYE versus ST. CATHERINE LABOURE HOSPITAL, Et. Al.: Mr. Arthur Abrams, Machinist, 58; Mrs. Joann Chepek, Housewife, 42; Mr. Roger Crawford, Chemist, 59, etc. 
ANGLE 
Galvin, seated at the conference table intent on the form in front of him. He crosses out something with a pen. Galvin takes the form, rises, walks across the room, walks by the defense table with Concannon and an Aide at it. Approaches the Jury Box, which has several prospective JURORS in it. 
He is very nervous. He addresses a man. 
GALVIN Mr. Abraham... 
ABRAMS Abrams... 
GALVIN Abrams. Yes. How are you today? 
ABRAMS I'm fine. 
GALVIN Good. (beat) You ever been inside a hospital? 
ABRAMS Yes. 
GALVIN Ah. How did they treat you? 
Galvin has flop sweat, Abrams is becoming intractable. 
ABRAMS I don't know what you mean. 
INT. CIGAR - COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Mickey standing by the door to the courtroom, looking through the glass panel, a newspaper under his arm, smoking. Galvin comes out. 
MICKEY Been a long time, huh...? 
GALVIN I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse? 
MICKEY Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this. 
He hands Galvin the newspaper. Galvin takes it, reads. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
The newspaper, folded to Page Two. A full-page photo of smiling doctors clustered around an operating table. Huge caption: "International Honors to St. Catherine Laboure Hospital. The faculte Internationale de la Chirurgerie today announced St. Catherine's as this year's recipient of the coveted Medaillon de la Sante..." etc. 
ANGLE 
Galvin reading. Looks up. 
GALVIN So what? 
MICKEY So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' 
GALVIN They still have to take it to a jury. 
Looks back at his form. 
MICKEY What I'm saying, they're getting some help. 
GALVIN (looks annoyed) So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case. 
They start walking across the Courthouse corridor. Mickey veers off and stops at a Cigar Stand. 
To the STAND OPERATOR: 
MICKEY John: gimme a cuesta-ray. 
GALVIN Oh shit, what's today? 
MICKEY Today is Tuesday. What? 
GALVIN I've got to go see Gruber. (to Cigar Stand Operator) What's the best cigars you have? 
MICKEY Give 'em a box of Macanudos. 
GALVIN Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it. 
JOHN Here you are, Franky. 
GALVIN (takes box) Thanks. Can you go over and meet her...? Tell her I'll stop by when I'm through... Laura Fischer... 
MICKEY Sure. Who is she?

JIM (taking book from Betsy) People do not read other people's diaries! It's not a very nice thing to do! (shooting them out) Now go in there and help Gussie with the table. 
BETSY (indicating debris) What about --? 
JIM I'll take care of that. Now, shoo, shoo. 
The children exit. Jim is about to put down the diary when his curiosity gets the better of him. Making sure he's unobserved, he sits down on a box, opens the book, starts to read. As his brows wrinkle with concern: 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The wind is howling, the trees swaying. The lights are on in the kitchen. CAMERA MOVES UP to the open kitchen window. 
INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
The family, in overcoats, is huddled around the kitchen table finishing dinner. Gussie, in overcoat and muffler, is clearing the dishes away. Jim, a sober look on his face, rises, takes a steaming kettle from the stove. 
MURIEL Where are you going? 
JIM To shave. 
MURIEL Tonight?? 
JIM While I can still trust myself with a razor. At six o'clock in the morning I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight. 
Jim abruptly exits. Muriel looks after him with concern. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. THE BLANDINGS' BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. After a few moments Muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the scene. 
MURIEL Excuse... 
She takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, Jim automatically moving around back of it in their previously established pattern. As Muriel puts the paste on her brush, replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position. 
MURIEL Excuse... 
JIM Muriel, do you have to do that now?! 
MURIEL There's no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night. 
JIM I'm not irritable! 
MURIEL Well, you're certainly something! You haven't said a civil word all evening. 
JIM Sometimes a man doesn't feel like talking. 
MURIEL (solicitously) What is it, dear? Something down at the office? 
JIM No. 
MURIEL Have you got the new slogan for "Wham"? 
JIM It's not due yet! 
MURIEL Well, it's something. You're certainly upset about something. I can always tell. 
JIM I'm not upset. (going back to shaving; with studied unconcern) It's just that I don't happen to approve of falsehood and deception. Particularly in my own wife. 
MURIEL What are you talking about? 
JIM (same) Oh, nothing. It's just that I distinctly remember your telling me you gave back Bill's fraternity pin fifteen years ago. 
Muriel looks at him, puzzled. 
JIM Well, did you or didn't you? 
MURIEL Did I, or didn't I what? 
JIM Give it back to him. 
MURIEL Of course I did. If I said I did, I did. 
JIM (suddenly Sam Spade) Then perhaps you'd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box? 
He takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her. Muriel takes the pin, looks at it sentimentally. Suddenly she looks at Jim and bursts out laughing. 
JIM What's so funny? 
MURIEL You! You're jealous! You're standing there with your face full of soap and you're jealous. 
JIM (angrily) If you were so crazy about the guy, why didn't you marry him?!

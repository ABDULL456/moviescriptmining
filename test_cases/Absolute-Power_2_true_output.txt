242   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                         242 
Seth and Burton.    The waiting is agony. 
243   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                        243 
Kate.     It's worse for her.   She glances around -- 
-- nothing, no one. 
244   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                         244 
McCarty.    All the time in the world. 
245   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                       245 
Collin.    Blows on his weapon slightly. 
246   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                        246 
Kate, and it's a question of how much longer she can take it. Her trembling is almost out of control -- she glances around again and -- 
-- and there he is! 
Luther Whitney himself, and he looks splendid in his new raincoat and hat -- 
-- he moves along in the shadow of the office building, toward the cafe, walking with his usual grace -- Luther always seems to glide. 
247   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                         247 
McCarty in the window.    Spotting Luther -- 
-- totally controlled. 
248   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                       248 
Collin does the same. 
249   INT. LOBBY - DAY                                              249 
Seth and Burton, and the instant Luther is visible, Seth gestures toward the policemen: Get ready. 
250   INT. BROWNSTONE - McCARTY - DAY                               250 
raising his rifle. 
251   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                    251 
Collin, raising his. 
252   EXT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - DAY                            252 
The three workmen, raising the glass panel. 
253   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     253 
Kate.   Watching her father come closer. 
Luther. It's hard to suppress a smile as he walks towards his daughter. 
Kate, still watching. 
Luther, almost there.     Speaks softly. 
LUTHER I did not kill that woman, Kate. 
254   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                      254 
McCarty, flipping off the safety. 
255   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                    255 
Collin, doing the same. 
256   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     256 
Luther and Kate, and he starts to sit -- 
257   INT. LOBBY - DAY                                           257 
Seth, right hand raised -- he's about to start it all in motion. 
258   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                      258 
McCarty, his finger floating to the trigger. 
259   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                    259 
Collin, doing the same. 
260   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     260 
Luther, seated now and as at last, he reaches out for his daughter's hand -- 
261   EXT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - DAY                            261 
-- The three workmen, and for a moment the glass panel slips and tilts and as it catches the afternoon sun -- 
262   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                      262 
-- McCarty, blinded as the red reflection hits his eyes but he FIRES. 
263   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     263 
Luther and Kate as suddenly the umbrella at their table is severed and starts to topple. 
264   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                    264 
Collin, startled, and he FIRES too.

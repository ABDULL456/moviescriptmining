46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS 
The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly bringing into view -- MARS. 
AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Those long gorges you see, clearly are the legendary canals of Mars.... 
The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.  Below:  a NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) (continuing) Of course, they are not manmade canals, but vast natural chasms ...many deeper and larger than the Grand Canyon.  Though utterly without moisture now, scientists have determined that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago. 
47      INT. SPACELINER 
Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep hidden memory he can't quite recall. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) (continuing) Surface temperatures at the Martian equator is minus one-hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade -- in winter. Fortunately, this time of year it's slightly more seasonable: Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit, outside the domes. (beat) Please remember, folks, that outside the domes you'll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply at all times. The atmosphere of Mars is almost a vacuum.  Thank you for flying with Interstellar and we hope your stay will be a pleasant one. 
48      EXT. MARS - OUTER SPACE 
CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS. 
49      EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY 
An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under a red-orange sky. 
The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the MARSPORT BUS. 
PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL 
A CITY UNDER A DOME. 
In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage. Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with a tough town carved out of the wilderness. 
50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY 
Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him. It is possible he is not a married man. 
QUAIL It's no Garden of Eden. 
TOUR ORGANISER No.  Quite a bit to see, though. The canyons, the old Sphinx... 
QUAIL What do you know about that? 
TOUR ORANISER Not much, really.  Millions of years old.  Bit like the one that used to be in Egypt, you know... 
QUAIL Yeah.  Got destroyed in the Arab wars... What about this independence movement? 
TOUR ORGANISER (dismissive) Not worth worrying about. Mostly descendants of the original colonists from Earth. Now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals... I don't think we've met.  You with our group?  Takes me a while to know everyone. 
QUAIL Sure.  Douglas Quail. 
TOUR ORGANISER Richard Toltz. (they shake hands) Well, Doug, I hope we'll see a lot more of each other. 
55      EXT. CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY 
The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised, temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures. The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town" atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water and air containers. 
A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the dome. 
Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	375 
Bigbooté and O'Connor emerging in the hallway...seen by Buckaroo Banzai and New Jersey as RED ARACHTOIDS... 
JOHN PARKER Look out, Buckaroo Banzai! 
Buckaroo turning and just in time, the alien JOHN GOMEZ right behind him...and behind Gomez, John Parker and Perfect Tommy with flame throwers... 
...Buckaroo and New Jersey hitting the deck as the RED ARACHTOID gets smoked, the aliens John Bigbooté and John O'Connor escaping in the confusion... 
INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	376 
The Secretary of Defense still on the floor, spotting the OVERTHRUSTER in Penny's purse, taking it just as Buckaroo and New Jersey rush into the room...lights swaying...shadows dancing... 
...the Secretary struggling to his feet as Buckaroo cuts Penny down...spraying her with a white insecticide, New Jersey checking her vital signs, Buckaroo shocking New Jersey accidentally with a jolt of STATIC ELECTRICITY, as the Secretary slips the OVERTHRUSTER under his coat... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (to no one in particular) It's not over yet...I'll bounce back...always have.  I'll come through this thing smelling like a goddamn rose-just watch me. 
The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids... 
NEW JERSEY Leave her to me. You take care of business. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Thanks. 
Buckaroo looking at New Jersey, knowing he can trust him, rummaging through Penny's purse...no Overthruster... 
INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	377 
Dr. Lizardo and the alien John O'Connor and the alien John Bigbooté seeing their deteriorating position OVER A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV...VIDEO IMAGES OF THE INVADING FORCES... 
DOCTOR LIZARDO Sound the call to board ship! 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it! 
JOHN O'CONNOR They are only monkey boys!  We can still crush them here--! 
Lizardo picking up a primitive INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER THE SIZE OF AN APPLE CRATE... 
DOCTOR LIZARDO You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns! 
INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	378 
Buckaroo joining the alien John Parker, the two of them tearing down one of the flooded passages...suddenly covering their ears from those PAINFUL, EAR-SPLITTING HORNS! 
INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT	379 
Secretary of Defense McKinley makes his way through several RED ARACHTOIDS running in blind panic...SIRENS WAILING... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Coming through!  Clear it! 
INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	380 
...the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows...as down on the floor, Dr. Lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into his BIG SUSPENDED SPACESHIP...Lizardo spotting Buckaroo, John Parker and Hong Kong Cavaliers entering this sacred space... 
DOCTOR LIZARDO Massacre them! Without quarter! 
Dr. Lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside, scurrying into his SPACESHIP with John Bigbooté and John O'CONNOR. 
INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	381 
no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to John O'Connor: 
DOCTOR LIZARDO Close the doors! 
INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	382 
Meanwhile, the floor of the hangar...the alien John Parker using strange judo, the amazing Blue Shields fighting like Samurai, ducking STINGERS, FIREING into the enemy at point blank range... 
BUCKAROO SEEING Dr. Lizardo's engine start up, CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE pouring from the exhaust pipes... 
John Parker fighting his way toward the ship... 
WHILE OVER YONDER the Secretary of Defense spots the JET CAR unattended amid that field of weird yellow totems... 
ANOTHER ANGLE	386 
John Parker reaching the BIG SPACESHIP to find Buckaroo already there, Buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a REAR ENTRANCE. 
INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	387 
Buckaroo settling into a weird little chair, John Parker at his side, facing the opposite direction in a love-seat arrangement...at a wall cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of LIZARDO...NO WAY INTO THE BIG SHIP FROM HERE...

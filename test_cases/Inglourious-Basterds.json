WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time. He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it. \nPRVT.BUTZ They let me go. \nFROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER. \nLT.ALDO Now when you report what happened here, you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you told us.

But the last answer didn't go down as well as he thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face. \nLT. ALDO Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't like that. You see, we like our Nazi's in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em, just like that. (Snaps his fingers) But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody gonna know you was a Nazi. And that don't sit well with us. Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt. \nLT.ALDO So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin, you can't take off. \nBACK TO HITLER Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face, his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND \nCARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD. \nBACK TO BASTERDS \nBUTZ'S POV: on ground, looking up at them.

However the CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from the little glass window in the back of the theatre The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced German omm paw paw musical movie being projected. The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium... \nTILL... .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the movie. \nA SUBTITLE APPEARS: \nPARIS \nTWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE \nOF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY\" We hear the sound of the German musicals climax. The lights go up in the auditorium. Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather their coats, and file out. \n3P. \nEXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS OFF the marquees lights. The MARQUEE READS in French: \"GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO\". \n", "test1_true": "INT - AUDITORIUM \nCU SHOSANNA still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty. The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in one of the cinema's opera box balconies. Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema. The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into \nENGLISH. \nMADAME MIMIEUX So young woman, since it's beyond obvious we're closed for the evening. I must assume you want something. What can I do for you? \nSHOSANNA May I sleep here tonight? \nMADAME MIMIEUX So I gather your not a nurse? \nSHOSANNA No. \nMADAME MIMIEUX But your a bright little thing, that's clever disguise. Where is your family? \nSHOSANNA Murdered. \nMADAME MIMIEUX So your a war orphan? \nSHOSANNA We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us \nMADAME MIMIEUX Is this a sad story? \nSHOSANNA Oui. \nMADAME MIMIEUX Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in Paris has one. I haven't bore you with mine, don't bore me with yours. \nSHOSANNA You can run the machines? \nMADAME MIMIEUX What machines? Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says; \nSHOSANNA The machines that show the film? \nMADAME MIMIEUX The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema, of course I can operate them. \nSHOSANNA I know, I saw you. \nFLASH ON: \nCU SHOSANNA eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching... \nMADAME MIMIEUX expertly working the projectors... \nBACK TO SHOSANNA \nSHOSANNA Teach me. Teach me to run the machines, that show the film. It's only you and the negro. I know you could use some help. \nMADAME MIMIEUX I know at least six people who've been put up against a wall, and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I have no intention of being unlucky number seven. How long have you been in Paris? \nSHOSANNA A week, and a few days. \nMADAME MIMIEUX How have you survived the curfew without capture? \nSHOSANNA I sleep on rooftops. \nMADAME MIMIEUX Again, I'm forced to admit, clever girl. How is it? \nSHOSANNA Cold. \nMADAME MIMIEUX \n(LAUGHS) I can imagine. \nSHOSANNA Respectfully, no you can't. \nMADAME MIMIEUX Fair enough. \nMADAME MIMIEUX So you can't operate a 35mm film projector, you want me teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole to hide in, is that correct? \nSHOSANNA Oui. \nMADAME MIMIEUX Whats your name? \nSHOSANNA Shosanna. \nMADAME MIMIEUX I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a home for wayward war orphans. Having said that, what you say is true. If you were truly exceptional, I could find use for you. So Shosanna, are you truly exceptional? \nSHOSANNA Oui Madame. \nMADAME MIMIEUX I will be the judge of that. \nDISSOLVE TO \n", "test1_id": 777, "test2_input": "FREDRICK Not exactly. \nSHOSANNA (Pfuit), what does that mean, \"not exactly\". I asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or no. Fredrick laughs at that line. \nFREDRICR When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister. This catches young Shosanna off guard. \nFREDRICR I come from a home of six sisters. We run a family operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema, reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our father wasn't up to the job. I admire her very much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a German uniform. \nSHOSANNA You were raised by Helga? \nFREDRICK All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga was the bossiest. \nSHOSANNA And your mother and father? \nFREDRICK My mother died. And my father was a loser. My fathers moto; \"If at first you don't succeed, quit\". The day he left, good riddance. My sisters are all I need. It's why I like your cinema. It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same time. \nSHOSANNA is your cinema still operatiing? \nFREDRICR Oui. \nSHOSANNA What's it called? \nFREDRICK The Kino Haus. \nSHOSANNA How has it done durring the war? \nFREDRICK Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up. \nSHOSANNA No doubt, you don't have to operate under a curfew. \nFREDRICK How often do you fill your house? \nSHOSANNA (Pfuit), not since before the war. \nFREDRICK So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out? \nSHOSANNA Of course, but that's not likely to happen. TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks. \nSHOSANNA So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me? \nFREDRICK Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't. \nSHOSANNA What did you do? He takes a sip of beer. \nFREDRICK I've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two...so far. You bet your sweet ass that got her attention. \nSHOSANNA Wow. \nFREDRICK I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia. It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers. \nSHOSANNA What's a bird's nest? \nFREDRICK A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen. \nSHOSANNA How many Russian's did you kill? \nFREDRICK Sixty-eight. \n(BEAT) The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two, the third day. On the forth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sgt.York. \nSHOSANNA Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits. \nFREDRICK Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It's called \"Nation's Pride\", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's another reason for all the attention. \nSHOSANNA \"Nation's Pride\" is about you? \"Nation's Pride\" is starring you? \nFREDRICK I know, comical, huh? \nSHOSANNA Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest? \nFREDRICK Hardly. I've been doing publicity, having my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so I've been helping them in the planning. Joseph is very keen on this film. He's telling anybody who will listen, when \"Nation's Pride\" is released, I'll be the German Van Johnson. Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch. However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as \"Joseph\", like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side of things. This young man is trouble with a capital \"T\", and she needs to stay far fucking away from him. She abruptly rises, and says; \nSHOSANNA Well, good luck with your premier Private. I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself. Au revoir. And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private alone. \nEXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY It's the next day. Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee. Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet. $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her ladder. \nWHEN... .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema. A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan. The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well. Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder; Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH. \n5 q. \nGESTAPO MAJOR Mademoiselle Nimieux? \nSHOSANNA Oui? Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French; \n", "test2_true": "DRIVER is this your cinema? \nSHOSANNA \nGESTAPO MAJOR Tell her to come down. \nDRIVER Come down please. She climbs down the ladder. The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to get in. \nSHOSANNA I don't understand, what have I done? \nDRIVER (to Major) She wants to know what she's done? \nGESTAPO MAJOR Who says she's done anything? \nDRIVER Who says you've done anything? Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner. \nSHOSANNA Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me? The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German; \nGESTAPO MAJOR Get your ass in that car. No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off. \nINT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris streets. \nWE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything. The sedan stops. The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand. \nEXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch. The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it. Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller, are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the table. We join them in mid-conversation; They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; \nGOEBBELS - it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically. America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat. Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major. Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself, and greets her before she reaches the table. Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; \nFREDRICK Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation. \nSHOSANNA Invitation? \nTHEN... .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN; \nGOEBBLES(OS) Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick? Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the arm, and leads her to him. \nFREDRICK Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet. Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth. The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally. \nFREDRICK Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does. \nGOEBBELS Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux. He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big bite of terri misu. They all laugh. Fredrick jumps in... \nFREDRICK And normally, this is beer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino. \nFRANCESCA looks up at Shosanna. \nNARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack; \nNARRATOR (VO) Francesca Mondino is much more then Goebbels French Interpreter. She's also Goebbels favorite French actress to appear in his films... \nFLASH ON: \nFILM CLIP from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions. Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG \nGERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER. She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH; \nFRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL I love you, I can't help it. My country or my heart, which do I betray? A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title; \n\"SENTIMENTAL COMBAT\" (1943) \nFLASH ON Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet bed. \nNARRATOR (VO) And Goebbels favorite French Mistress, to act in his bed. WE SEE JUST A SUPER QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca \nDOGGY STYLE. \nFRANCESCA \n(ANIMAL-LIKE) Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me! \nBACK TO FRANCESCA looking at Shosanna. \nFRANCESCA Bon jour. \nSHOSANNA Bon jour. \nI f. \nFREDRICK And you've met the Major. The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German; \nGESTAPO MAJOR Actually, I didn't introduce myself. (to Shosanna) Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle. (he clicks his heels) Please allow me, have a seat. The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small craft on the table. \nMAJOR HELLSTROM Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good. Goebbels looks across the table at her. \n", "test2_id": 778, "test3_input": "(CON'T) Because you love me. And I love you. And your the only person on this earth I can trust. She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now, face to face. \nSHOSANNA \n(CON'T) But that's not all we're going to do. Does the filmmaking equipment it the attic still work? I know the film camera does. How about the sound recorder? \nMARCEL Quite well, actually. I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week. It works superb. Why do we need filmmaking equipment? \nSHOSANNA Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film. Just for the Nazi's. \nFADE TO BLACK \n?G. \nFADE OFF \nINT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors that serve as a entrance to the room. \nMILITARY ATTACHE Right this way, Lieutenant. A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX. A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of Bel Ami, years). Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked. Standing before him is legendary military mastermind, GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the Dammed). But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL. \nLT. HICOX Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir. \nGEN FENECH (Salutes back) General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox. Drink? Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't introduced, he ain't there. \nLT.HICOX if you offered me a scotch and plane water, I could drink a scotch and plain water. \nGEN.FENECH That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like a good chap, will you? Bars in the globe. Hicox heads over to the bar globe. \nLT.HICOX Something for yourself, sir? \nGEN.FENECH Whiskey straight. No junk in it. The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy. Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file. \nGEN.FENECH It says here you've run three undercover commando operations in Germany, and German occupied territories? Frankfaurt, Holland, and Norway to be exact? Back to them, mixing drinks, he says; \nLT.HICOX Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's. \nGEN.FENECH It says here you speak German fluently? \nLT.HICOX Like a Katzenjammer Kid. \nGEN.FENECH And your occupation before the war? His back still to us, as he bartends... \nLT. H I COX I'm a film critic. \nGEN.FENECH List your accomplishments? \nLT.HICOX Well sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles, for a publication called; \"Films and Filmmakers\". As well as our sister publication. \n7f . \nGEN.FENECH What's that called? \nLT.HICOX \"Flickers Bi-Monthly\". And I've had two books published. \nGEN.FENECH Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant, what are their titles? \nLT. HI COX The first book was called; \"Art Of The Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties\". And the second one was called; ... He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as he walks toward the General, handing him his drink. \nLT.HICOX \"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci\". It's a subtexual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst. \nLT. HI COX What should we drink to, sir? \nGEN.FENECH (Thinking, for a moment) Down with Hitler. \nLT.HICOX All the way down, sir. \nGEN.FENECH Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich? \nLT. HI COX Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I am familiar with it. \nGEN.FENECH Explain it to me.? \nLT.HICOX Pardon sir? \nGEN.FENECH This little escapade of ours, requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels? \nLT.HICOX Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema. A alternative to what he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties. And the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood. SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room; \nCHURCHELL How's he doing? \nLT. H I COX Frightfully sorry sir, once again? \nCHURCHELL You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game? Compared to say .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing? \n", "test3_true": "CHURCHELL Brief him. \nGEM.FENECH Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd like to brief you on, Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in Paris - \nLT.HICOX - What film sir? The General has to resort to peeking at his file. \nGEN.FENECH The motion pictures called; \"Nation's Pride\". \nLT.HICOX Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller? \nGEN.FENECH We don't have any intelligence, on exactly, what the film that night will be about. \nLT.HICOX But it's called \"Nation's Pride\"? \nGEN.FENECH Yes. \nLT.HICOX I can tell you what it's about, it's about Private Fredrick Zoller. He's the German Sgt.York. Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man. \nGEN.FENECH In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring, Boorman, and most of the German High command, including all high ranking officers of both The S.S., and, The Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry. \nLT.HICOX The master race at play, aye? \nGEN.FENECH Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket. \nLT.HICOX (Reciting a a poem) \"...and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth\". Jolly good, sir. \nGEN.FENECH An American Secret Service outfit, that lives deep behind enemy lines, will be your assist. The Germans call them; \"The Basterds\". \nLT.HICOX \"The Basterds\", never heard of them. \nGEN.FENECH Whole point of the secret service, old boy, you not hearing of them. But the Gerrys have heard of them, because these yanks have been them the devil. Their leader is a chap named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans call him, \"Aldo the Apache\". \nLT.HICOX Why do they call him that? \nGEN.FENECH Best guess, is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead. \nLT.HICOX Scalps, sir? \nGEN.FENECH The hair. He runs his finger along his hairline. \nGEN.FENECH Like a red Injun. \nLT.HICOX Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky bird, isn't he? \nGEN.FENECH No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a nutters. But you've heard the expression, \"It takes a thief\". \nLT.HICOX Indeed. General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map. \n9i. \nGEN.FENECH You'll be dropped into France, about twenty four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a little village called, \"Nadine\". (He points it out on the map) Apparently the Gerrys never go there. In Nadine, there's a tavern, called, \"La Louisiane\", you'll rendez-vous with our double agent, and she'll take it from there. She's the one who's going to get you in the premiere. It will be you, her, and two German born members of the Basterds. She's also made all the other arrangements your going to need. \nLT.HICOX How will I know her? \nGEN.FENECH I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you. Your contact is Bridget Von Hammersmark. \nLT.HICOX Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England? \nGEN.FENECH For the last two years now. one could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild. In the back of the room the bulldog barks; \nCHURCHELL Extraordinary women. \nLT.BICOX Quite. \nGEN.FENECH You'll go to the premiere as her escort, lucky devil. She'll also have the premiere tickets for the other two. Got the gist? \nLT.HICOX I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles. The three British bulldogs laugh. \nEXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema, literally, making a movie. Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, positioned low looking up. Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it. A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame. As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into you know what. \nMARCEL We need a sync mark. \nSHOSANNA What is a sync mark? \nMARCEL A action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound. \nSHOSANNA How do we do that? \nMARCEL Clap your hands. She does. \nMARCEL In frame imbecile. She claps her hands in front of her face. \nMARCEL Ready? Shosanna takes a deep breath, then; \n", "test3_id": 779}

JESSE Get out. 
The Hooker does. 
INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER 
Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun. 
The boat rocks gently. 
JESSE We got some shit to discuss. 
Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated: 
BUZZ Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler. 
LONG-HAIR (top of his lungs) I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor! 
In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF. 
Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together. 
BUZZ FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK! 
JESSE House call. 
Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place. 
JESSE Where's Lucian?! 
BUZZ I don't know! 
Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck snaps. Teeth rattle. 
BUZZ NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE KNOWS- 
Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red. 
BUZZ ...fuck... 
Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw. 
JESSE Who killed my family? 
BUZZ Ah shit, man! 
Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria. 
JESSE (racks another shell) WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?! 
BUZZ CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH! 
Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face. 
BUZZ (flinches) The fuck is that? (sniffs, realizes) WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?! 
Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair. 
BUZZ (thrashing) NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!! 
As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead aim...FIRES. 
THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES. 
Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN. 
Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING. 
Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN 
Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water. 
Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being questioned by Marandino. 
Bud and Cobb stand apart. 
COBB We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through the front door. 
Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS barge forward. 
FITCH Carter! We need to talk. 
BUD Get out of my way, Fitch. 
FITCH (following Bud) This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy bullshit is not how it's done! 
BUD While your agents build their cases and set for court, he'll erase the debt owed to all of you. Overnight. 
FITCH So you're implying I should thank him? 
Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking... 
FITCH Look, Carter, whether we like it or not, you and I have to work together on this. We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full protection, if he agrees to testify.

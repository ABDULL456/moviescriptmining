RAYBURN I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off. 
CREASY Maybe... 
Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least. 
RAYBURN It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. What were you shooting at? 
Creasy doesn't answer.    He holds the bullet up, looks at it. 
RAYBURN (focusing; concerned) Creasy? 
CREASY Sorry I woke you, Ray. 
Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the house, but stops short again. 
There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing her for the first time. And she's been watching him forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected somehow. 
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox. It takes it place of honor front and center on the shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New Testament is set down nearby.

CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time. 
INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY 
Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back. Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals a look at him. 
EXT.   STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it. 
INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY 
Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with. 
CREASY Pinta, do you have a pencil? 
PINTA I go to school, don't I? 
Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's thinking. 
CREASY Please? 
Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate. 
Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her shoulder... 
BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop.    The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead. 
CREASY Sorry. 
LISA The traffic takes some getting used to. 
As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       34. 
EXT.   COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY 
They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks; Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek. 
PINTA Bye, Mom. 
LISA Don't forget your towel. 
Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. As she starts to walk past Creasy without a      word, he holds out her pencil. She holds up, shows him       a SECOND PENCIL, continues on her way. Doesn't need       him. 
MERCEDES 
Creasy gets back in, starts away. 
LISA She has swimming practice today.    You'll need to pick her up at the pool. 
Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window. 
LISA I talked to her. She understands.     She won't bother you anymore. 
As Creasy just drives. 
EXT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN. 
LISA (sees him) Creasy! (stepping over) Meet Jordan and Evelyn. 
Creasy nods.    They study him with interest. 
JORDAN So you're the bodyguard? (Creasy nods again) You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune? 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                 35. 
Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare. 
EVELYN (giggles) Does he talk? 
As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers... 
EVELYN He's sexy... 
Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks. 
JORDAN You see any danger out there? (laughs) The fear's worse than the reality. 
Just a blankness from Creasy.

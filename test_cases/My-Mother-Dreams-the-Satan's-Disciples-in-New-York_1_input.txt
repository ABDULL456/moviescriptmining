Marian blushes at their warm response to her unexpected appearance. 
HEAD DISCIPLE (explaining her visit) Marian's daughter lives across the street and she was a little worried about her. 
DISCIPLE #1 Swear to God, lady, she's not here. 
Laughter erupts.  Marian smiles. 
DISCIPLE #2 Hey, is she cute? 
DISCIPLE #3 Does she like motorcycles? 
DISCIPLE #4 Can she cook? 
Amiable laughter fills the room.  Marian laughs with them. She glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in New York. 
MARIAN You know, this isn't so bad.  It looks like our kids' rooms when they were growing up. 
INSERT SHOTS - 
of overflowing ashtrays, crushed beer cans, fast food wrappers balled up and strewn on tables. 
BACK - 
to Marian, her brow knitted thoughtfully in a schoolmarmish expression.

JANE It's called a croque-monsieur. It's one of the first things I learned to make when I lived in Paris because the ingredients are really really cheap. 
ADAM When did you live in Paris? 
JANE In my early twenties. I went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery. Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass. JANE Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails and turning them into something so beautiful. 
ADAM You are rapidly becoming one of the most appreciative clients I've ever had... JANE Well, I'm not all that used to being able to count on anyone... ADAM (surprised by that) Really? 
46   JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME                                  46 He squints, looking ahead, SEES: 
JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP 
And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house. 
47   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                       47 JANE I know it's none of my business but... I'm trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced. 
ADAM And what'd you come up with? 
JANE Something in the you're too nice department..? 
ADAM Yes, that and my wife fell in love with my best friend. Ex-best friend. JANE Oh, no! 
ADAM We were all on a biking trip, he and his wife, me and my wife...through Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love. 
JANE That's awful. 
ADAM Yeah.   Not a great plane ride home. 
JANE I can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is -- oh, that's rough. 
ADAM Actually they went on to Venice and I flew back with Carol, his wife. You can't imagine what it's like to sit next to someone who's been crying for ten straight hours. JANE I don't blame her. 
ADAM I was talking about me. Anyway, they're married now and it's pretty much an ongoing awful thing. But, you and your ex... When I saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning, I thought -- Wow! That's the way it's supposed to be. You two seem to have it all figured out. 
JANE We're not as figured out as you'd think. 
48   EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                      48 Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn, careful not to be seen. 
49   BACK TO SCENE                                               49 Jane clears their dishes. 
JANE (laughs) You know I hope you don't feel I've been interrogating you, but... (MORE) JANE(cont'd) I know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department. I mean, do you date ever or... ADAM Uh, constantly actually. 
JANE Constantly? 
ADAM Everyone I know or have ever known has fixed me up. And then, sometimes I just meet women, I don't know how that happens, but... 
JANE -- But no girlfriend? 
ADAM Not yet. 
Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass. 
JANE Just like to date... 
ADAM Actually, I find it really stressful. You know, the last time I was in the dating world was 1978. It's a little more complicated these days. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. Not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook. 
Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She smiles, wiping the counter. 
ADAM That was a compliment. So you don't have a guy in your life at the moment?

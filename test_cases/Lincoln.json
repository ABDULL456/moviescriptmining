{"train": "LINCOLN \nWritten by \nTony Kushner \nBased in Part on \nTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln \nBy Doris Kearns Goodwin \nFinal Shooting Script December 20, 2011 \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY \nHeavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted, their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen. \nA terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies, Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee- deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath, fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets, pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy, nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners. \nHAROLD GREEN (V.O.) Some of us was in the Second Kansas Colored. We fought the rebs at Jenkins' Ferry last April, just after they'd killed every Negro soldier they captured at Poison Springs. \nEXT. PARADE GROUNDS ADJACENT TO THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, ANACOSTIA RIVER - NIGHT \nRain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North Carolina. \nTwo black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit: HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is at his side. \nHAROLD GREEN So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided warn't taking no reb prisoners. And we didn't leave a one of `em alive. The ones of us that didn't die that day, we joined up with the 116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp Nelson Kentucky. \nLINCOLN What's your name, soldier? \nHAROLD GREEN Private Harold Green, sir. \nIRA CLARK I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry. We're waiting over there. \nHe nods in the direction of his cavalry. \nIRA CLARK (CONT'D) We're leaving our horses behind, and shipping out with the 24th Infantry for the assault next week on Wilmington. \nLINCOLN (to Harold Green:) How long've you been a soldier? \nHAROLD GREEN Two year, sir. \nLINCOLN Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry. \nHAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK That's right, sir. They killed a thousand rebel soldiers, sir. They were very brave. (hesitating, then) And making three dollars less each month than white soldiers. \nHarold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness. \nHAROLD GREEN Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we fight now we - \nIRA CLARK Another three dollars subtracted from our pay for our uniforms. \nHAROLD GREEN That was true, yessir, but that CHANGED - \nIRA CLARK Equal pay now. Still no commissioned Negro officers. \nLINCOLN I am aware of it, Corporal Clark. \nIRA CLARK Yes, sir, that's good you're aware, sir. It's only that - \nHAROLD GREEN (to Lincoln, trying to change the subject:) You think the Wilmington attack is gonna be - \nIRA CLARK Now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing Negro men with guns, fighting on their behalf, and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting the same pay - in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains. In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a hundred years - the vote. \nGreen's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln. \nLINCOLN What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark? \nIRA CLARK Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me. \nLINCOLN Perhaps I will. \nIRA CLARK But you should know, sir, that I get sick at the smell of bootblack and I can't cut hair. \nTHE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR \nEXT. A SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT \nA huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing through the choppy black waters of an open sea. \nLincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret. \nLINCOLN (V.O.) It's nighttime. The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed. \nLincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon, indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship. \nLINCOLN (V.O.) Though it's imperceptible in the darkness, I have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore. No one else seems to be aboard the vessel. I'm alone. \nINT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases: clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere. \nLincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with documents on his lap. \nMARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and night cap. She watches him in her vanity mirror. \nShe looks frightened. \nTITLE: THE WHITE HOUSE \nLINCOLN I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace. \nMary looks at him, stricken with alarm. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) I should spare you. I shouldn't tell you my dreams. \nMARY I don't want to be spared if you aren't! And you spare me nothing. \nHe looks down at the carpet, then back up at her. \nMARY (CONT'D) Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on Wilmington port. You dream about the ship before a battle, usually. \nLINCOLN (rapping lightly on his FOREHEAD:) How's the coconut? \nMARY Beyond description. \nShe delicately touches her head. \nMARY (CONT'D) Almost two years, nothing mends. Another casualty of the war. Who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident? \nLINCOLN I do. \nMARY Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer, that's all I am anymore, I'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination - \nLINCOLN It was most probably an - \nMARY It was an assassin. Whose intended target was you. \nLINCOLN How's the plans for the big shindy progressing? \nMARY I don't want to talk about parties! You don't care about parties. \nLINCOLN Not much but they're a necessary - \nMary studies Lincoln, thinking. Then a revelation: \nMARY I know...I know what it's about. The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign! It's the amendment to abolish slavery! Why else would you force me to \ninvite demented radicals into my home? \nLincoln closes his folio. \nMARY (CONT'D) You're going to try to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, before the term ends, before the Inauguration. \nLINCOLN (STANDING:) Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs. \nMary stands, goes up to him. \nMARY No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now. Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) That's my speech. \nHe smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays \"We Are Coming Father Abra'am\" and the audience joins in. Among them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick, exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased. \nAUDIENCE \"We are coming, Father Abra'am, three hundred thousand more, From Mississippi's winding stream and from New England's shore...\" We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear, With hearts too full for utterance, With but a silent tear. We're coming Father Abra'am...\" \nEXT. A CARRIAGE, PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON - MORNING \nIn a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite Lincoln. Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio on his lap. \nSEWARD Even if every Republican in the House votes yes - far from guaranteed, since when has our party unanimously supported anything? - but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it. We'd still be twenty votes short. \nLINCOLN Only twenty. \nSEWARD Only twenty! \nLINCOLN We can find twenty votes. \nSEWARD Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery! In my opinion - \nLINCOLN To which I always listen. \nSEWARD Or pretend to. \nLINCOLN With all three of my ears. \nSEWARD We'll win the war soon - It's inevitable, isn't it? \nLINCOLN Ain't won yit. \nSEWARD You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature. Imagine the possibilities peace will bring! Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House? It's a rats' nest in there, the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back. We'll lose. \nLincoln smiles. \nLINCOLN I like our chances now. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nLincoln is at his desk, Hay feeding him documents to read and sign. Seward warms himself by the fireplace, holding a brandy. \nSEWARD Consider the obstacles that we'd face. The aforementioned two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment: we have a Republican \nmajority, but barely more than fifty percent - \nLINCOLN Fifty-six. \nSEWARD We need Democratic support. There's none to be had. \nLINCOLN Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election. Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November. That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March. \nSEWARD LINCOLN I know, but that's - They don't need to worry about re-election, they can vote however it suits `em. \nThere's a knock at the office door. \nSEWARD LINCOLN But we can't, um, buy the (to Hay:) vote for the amendment. It's Might as well let `em in. too important. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) I said nothing of buying anything. We need twenty votes was all I said. Start of my second term, plenty of positions to fill. \nHay opens the door to the outer office, admitting the sound of a sizable crowd. JOHN NICOLAY, 33, Lincoln's rather severe German-born senior secretary, ushers in MR. JOLLY, mid-40s, mud-spattered coat, hat in hands, followed by MRS. JOLLY, similarly road-worn, holding a suitcase. Lincoln stands. \nJOHN NICOLAY Mr. President, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Jolly who've come from Missouri to - \nMR. JOLLY From Jeff City, President. \nLincoln shakes Mr. Jolly's hand. Mrs. Jolly curtseys. \nLINCOLN Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward. \nSeward nods slightly as he lights a Cuban cigar. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Jeff City. \nLincoln looks at the Jollys. They are worried and a little awed. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) I heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning crying out, \"Today is the day the world shall end, as scripture has foretold.\" And one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet, I presume, thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy! \nNicolay escorts them out. Before he closes the door: \nLINCOLN Oh, Nicolay? When you have a moment. \nNicolay nods and steps into the anteroom, where dozens more petitioners are waiting to speak with Lincoln. Hay confers with the doorman. Seward closes the door behind them. \nLincoln kneels at the fireplace, stoking the fire. He puts more wood in, then stands. Seward watches him, then: \nSEWARD If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend, I'll fetch a friend from Albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work. Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats. Spare you the exposure and liability. \nThere is a sharp knock on the closed door, followed by two long ones. \nLINCOLN Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to. \nLincoln opens the door. Tad enters, cross. \nTAD Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over because Tom says mama says they're too distressing, but- \nLINCOLN You had nightmares all night, mama's right to - \nTAD But I'll have worse nightmares if you don't let me look at the plates again! \nLINCOLN Perhaps. \nSEWARD We can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party...not even a single Republican absent when they vote. You know who you've got to see. \nNicolay enters. Lincoln turns to him. \nLINCOLN Send over to Blair House. Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock. \nSEWARD (a shudder, a swallow of BRANDY:) God help you. God alone knows what he'll ask you to give him. \nINT. THE LIBRARY, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON - EVENING \nLincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman. \nLINCOLN If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment. \nThe room is baronial. PRESTON BLAIR, patriarch of his wealthy and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son, MONTGOMERY BLAIR, 50, whip-thin. A fire blazes in a massive fireplace behind Monty. Preston's handsome, elegant daughter, ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE, 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad, who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by his side. \nMONTGOMERY BLAIR No conservative Republican is what you mean - \nPRESTON BLAIR All Republicans ought to be conservative, I founded this party - in my own goddamned home - to be a conservative antislavery party, not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and - \nELIZABETH BLAIR LEE Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy, you'll frighten the child. \nMONTGOMERY BLAIR (TO LINCOLN:) You need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the radicals and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need our help. \nLINCOLN Yes, sir, I do. \nMONTGOMERY BLAIR Well, what do we get? \nELIZABETH BLAIR LEE Whoo! Blunt! Your manners, Monty, must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you out of his cabinet. \nPRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR He was pushed out - I wasn't pushed. \nELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D) (SMILING SARCASTICALLY:) Oh of course you weren't. \nPRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:) the goddamn radical I agreed to resign. abolishonists! \nELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D) (a nod at Tad:) Oh Daddy, please! \nPRESTON BLAIR You don't mind, boy, do you? \nLINCOLN He spends his days with soldiers. \nTAD They taught me a song! \nPRESTON BLAIR Did they? Soldiers know all manner of songs. How's your brother Bob? \nTAD He's at school now, but he's coming to visit in four days! For the shindy! \nPRESTON BLAIR At school! Ain't that fine! Good he's not in the army! \nTAD Oh he wants to be, but mama said he CAN'T - \nSEWARD No. Nothing strictly illegal. \nROBERT LATHAM It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen. They starve otherwise. \nRICHARD SCHELL I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham that we're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes. Jobs and nothing more. \nSEWARD That's correct. \nW.N. BILBO Congressmen come cheap! Few thousand bucks'll buy you all you need. \nSEWARD The President would be unhappy to hear you did that. \nW.N. BILBO Well, will he be unhappy if we lose? \nA WAITRESS brings in a platter of roasted crabs, which she slams down on the table, and leaves. \nSEWARD The money I managed to raise for this endeavor is only for your fees, food, and lodgings. \nW.N. BILBO Uh huh. If that squirrel-infested attic you've quartered us in's any measure, you ain't raised much. \nRICHARD SCHELL Shall we get to work? \nBilbo takes a mallet to a crab, smashing it! \nINT. FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY \nA gavel slams down on a sounding block in an attempt to silence the raucous tumult in the large chamber. It subsides enough for Colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central DAIS: \nSCHUYLER COLFAX The House recognizes Fernando Wood, the honorable representative from New York. \nTITLE: THE HOUSE DEBATE BEGINS \nJANUARY 9 \nFloor and balcony are full, although the desks of representatives from seceded states are bare and unoccupied. \nOn the Democratic side, 81 members applaud FERNANDO WOOD (D, NY) as he takes the podium. The Democratic leadership, including GEORGE YEAMAN (KY), has gathered around House minority leader GEORGE PENDLETON(OH). On the Republican side of the aisle, enraged booing from the 102 Republicans, including HIRAM PRICE (IA), GEORGE JULIAN (IN), Vintner Litton and Ashley, all gathered around Stevens's desk. \nFERNANDO WOOD Estimable colleagues. Two bloody years ago this month, his Highness, King Abraham Africanus the First - our Great Usurping Caesar, violator of habeas corpus and freedom of the press, abuser of states' rights - \nHIRAM PRICE FERNANDO WOOD (loud:) - radical republican autocrat If Lincoln really were a ruling by fiat and martial tyrant, Mr. Wood, he'd'a had law affixed his name to his your empty head impaled on a heinous and illicit pike, and the country better Emancipation Proclamation, for it! promising it would hasten the end of the war, which yet rages on and on. \nMurmuring from the floor and the balcony, in the front row of which Mary and Elizabeth Keckley sit. Mary turns her gaze from the floor to watch Latham and Schell, a few seats away, scrutinize the floor, whispering, Latham taking notes. Schell holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap. Bilbo sits behind them. \nThey study the other NY Democrats - CHARLES HANSON, NELSON MERRICK, HENRY LANFORD, HOMER BENSON, GILES STUART - who \ncomprise a cluster of glum uncomfortable passivity on that side of the aisle. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM He claimed, as tyrants do, (whispering to Schell:) that the war's emergencies The New York delegation's permitted him to turn our looking decidedly uninspired. army into the unwilling instrument of his monarchical AMBITIONS - \nWood points at Stevens, granite-faced. Stevens's eyes burn back at Wood. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) - and radical Republicanism's abolitionist fanaticism! \nThis prompts shouts and boos from the Republicans. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) His Emancipation Proclamation has obliterated millions of dollars' worth of personal property rights - \nSchell examines the Pennsylvania Democrats: an openly appalled ARCHIBALD MORAN, AMBROSE BAILER, and, chewing his thumb, a painful fake grin pinned to his face, ALEXANDER COFFROTH. Schell leans in to Latham. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) RICHARD SCHELL - and \"liberated\" the Over in Pennsylvania - who's hundreds of thousands of the sweaty man eating his hopelessly indolent Negro thumb? refugees, bred by nature for servility, to settle in ROBERT LATHAM squalor in our Northern Unknown to me. Seems jumpy. cities! RICHARD SCHELL Perhaps he'll jump. \nCheering and booing. \nIn the Connecticut delegation, JOHN ELLIS winds his pocket watch, looking contemptuously at Wood. Schell makes a note. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) W.N. BILBO But all that was not enough Jesus, when's this son-of- for this dictator, who now liberty sonofabitch gonna sit seeks to insinuate his down? miscegenist pollution into the Constitution itself! RICHARD SCHELL John Ellis is going to break his watch if he doesn't stop - \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) We are once again asked - nay, commanded - to consider a proposed thirteenth amendment which, if passed, shall set at immediate liberty four million coloreds while manacling the limbs of the white race in America. If it is passed - but it shall not pass! \nWild cheering and booing. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM Every member of the House What's more interesting is loyal to the Democratic Party how dismal and disgruntled and the constituents it Mr. Yeaman appears. He should serves shall oppose- be cheering right now, but... \nW.N. BILBO Looks like he ate a bad oyster. \nROBERT Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go back to - \nShe stops him with an alarmed look. \nMARY We'll fatten you up before you return to Boston. \nROBERT All right, mama. \nMARY All right. (beaming at him, ADORINGLY:) Oh Robbie... \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nPreston Blair, still in his traveling cloak, and Lincoln stand near the fireplace facing one another. \nPRESTON BLAIR Jefferson Davis is sending three delegates: Stephens, Hunter and Campbell: Vice President of the Confederacy, their former Secretary of State, and their Assistant \nSecretary of War. They're coming in earnest to propose peace. \nBoth men look into the fire. Preston moves closer. \nPRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) I know this is unwelcome news for you. Now hear me: I went to Richmond to talk to traitors, to smile at and plead with traitors, because it'll be spring in two months, the roads'll be passable, the Spring slaughter commences. Four bloody Springs now! Think of my Frank, who you've taken to your heart, how you'll blame yourself if the war takes my son as it's taken multitudes of sons. Think of all the boys who'll die if you don't make peace. You must talk with these men! \nLINCOLN I intend to, Preston. And in return, I must ask you - \nPRESTON BLAIR LINCOLN No, this is not horsetrading, - to support our push for this is life and - the amendment when it reaches THE - \nThere's a knock on the door. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Not now! \nRobert enters. Nicolay stands behind him, apologetic. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home. \nHe shakes hands with his son, stiffly. \nROBERT Thank you. \nLINCOLN PRESTON BLAIR (to Robert:) (pointedly:) I'm talking to Preston Blair, You're looking fit, Robert. we - Harvard agrees with you. Fit ROBERT and rested. Mr. Blair. \nLINCOLN (dismissing Robert, UNINTENTIONALLY ABRUPT) Just give us a moment please, Robert. Thank you. \nHe turns to Preston. Robert, stung, hesitates, then leaves the room, Nicolay shutting the door behind him. \nPRESTON BLAIR I will procure your votes for you, as I promised. You've always kept your word to me. Those Southern men are coming. (taking Lincoln's hand) I beg you, in the name of Gentle CHRIST - \nPRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) LINCOLN Talk peace with these men. Preston, I understand... \nLINCOLN (SHARPLY) I understand, Preston. \nEXT. ON THE MALL - AFTERNOON \nJACOB GRAYLOR (D, PA) and Bilbo walk outside the Capitol. Graylor looks over the prospectuses. \nROBERT LATHAM (V.O.) We have one abstention so far - \nRICHARD SCHELL (V.O.) Jacob Graylor - \nGraylor selects one and hands it to Bilbo. \nRICHARD SCHELL (V.O.) He'd like to be Federal Revenue Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania. \nINT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - NIGHT \nA small room, two beds, in disarray: newspapers, overflowing ashtrays, whiskey bottles empty on the floor. Latham and Schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker game. Bilbo lies on one of the beds. All three are in their shirtsleeves. Seward is at the table. \nROBERT LATHAM - so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is reduced to 182, which means 122 yes votes to reach the requisite two- thirds of the House. Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment...? \nSeward nods, less assertively than Latham would like. \nROBERT LATHAM (CONT'D) Then, despite our abstention, to reach a two-thirds majority we remain 20 yeses short. \nINT. THE OLD TAVERN, WASHINGTON - NIGHT \nBilbo is drinking schooners of beer with EDWIN LECLERK (D, OH) and CLAY HAWKINS (D, OH). Hawkins listens as Bilbo gives his pitch. LeClerk looks at the prospectuses. \nBilbo walks with Clay Hawkins, who peruses the folio. Bilbo has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder. Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear. \nCLAY HAWKINS T-tax collector for the Western Reserve. Th-th-that pays handsomely. \nW.N. BILBO Don't just reach for the highest branches. They sway in every breeze. Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston looks like the ticket to me. \nCLAY HAWKINS Uh, boats, they, they make me sick. \nBilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot. Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket. \nCLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D) So just stand on the dock. Let the Assistant Assistant Port Inspector's stomach go weak. \nBilbo eyes Hawkins, who anxiously eyes the folio. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nSeward hands the last prospectus to Nicolay, who unfolds it, places it on top of the other prospectuses, and records details about Hawkins's appointment in a notebook. Seward smokes a cigar, Nicolay a pipe. Lincoln sits, feet up, examining a newspaper. \nSEWARD And lastly, Democratic yes vote number six. Hawkins from Ohio. \nLINCOLN Six. \nSEWARD Well, thus far. Plus Graylor's abstention. From tiny acorns and so on. \nLINCOLN What'd Hawkins get? \nJOHN NICOLAY (STILL WRITING:) Postmaster of the Millersburg Post Office. \nLINCOLN He's selling himself cheap, ain't he? \nSEWARD He wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve - a first-term congressman who couldn't manage re- election, I felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster. (TO NICOLAY:) Scatter `em over several rounds of appointments, so no one notices. And burn this ledger, please, after you're done. \nLincoln stands. \nLINCOLN (TO NICOLAY:) Time for my public opinion bath. Might as well let `em in. \nNicolay helps Lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis! Thirteen to go! \nSEWARD One last item, an absurdity, but - My associates report that among the Representatives a fantastical rumor's bruited about, which I immediately disavowed, that you'd allowed bleary old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan. \nLincoln is silent. A horrifying reality dawns for Seward: \nSEWARD (CONT'D) I, of course, told them you would never...Not without consulting me, you wouldn't...Because why on earth would you? \nEXT. IN AN OPEN FIELD NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA - EVENING \nTHREE UNION CAVALRY OFFICERS consult with THREE CONFEDERATE CAVALRY OFFICERS, all mounted. The officers exchange documents and salutes. \nTITLE: NO MAN'S LAND \nOUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA \nJANUARY 11 \nThe ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three Confederate officials sit: Vice President ALEXANDER STEPHENS, 53, short; JOHN A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War, 54; and Senator R.M.T. HUNTER, 56. They're well-dressed for winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled. \nStephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting company of Union cavalry and infantry. \nA Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one side, driven by TWO BLACK SOLDIERS, stands near broken wagons and a derelict cannon. ANOTHER BLACK SOLDIER stands at attention by the ambulance's rear door. \nThe soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely to the ambulance. The Confederate peace commissioners hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers. Then Stephens pushes past Hunter. He nods to the soldier. \nALEXANDER STEPHENS (with polite dignity:) Much obliged. \nHe boards the ambulance. His fellow delegates follow in his wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers before climbing in. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nSeward stands, stunned. Lincoln sits at the cabinet table. Nicolay is gone. \nSEWARD Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm Secretary of State! You, you, you informally send a reactionary dottard, to - What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive? \nLINCOLN We'll hear `em out. \nLINCOLN When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Ah, shit on the people and what they want and what they're ready for! I don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want! This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of `em. And I look a lot worse without the wig. The people elected me! To represent them! To lead them! And I lead! You ought to try it! \nLINCOLN I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I have tried to profit from the example of it. But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America. \nStevens glares at him, then smiles. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Oh, how you have longed to say that to me. You claim you trust them - but you know what the people are. You know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery. White people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with Negroes. \nLincoln reaches over to Stevens and gives his shoulder a vigorous shake. Stevens endures this. \nLINCOLN A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice \nabout the swamps and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way. If in pursuit of your destination you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North? \nINT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nSpectacles on, Lincoln unlaces Mary's corset. \nLINCOLN Robert's going to plead with us to let him enlist. \nHe's unlaced enough; she unhooks the front and steps out of her corset and petticoats, turns to him in her plain thin chemise and drawers. \nMARY Make time to talk to Robbie. You only have time for Tad. \nLINCOLN Tad's young. \nMARY So's Robert. Too young for the army. \nLINCOLN Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up... \nMARY Don't take Robbie. Don't let me lose my son. \nThere's a knock on the door. Mary turns to it, furious: \nMARY (CONT'D) Go away! We're occupied! \nLincoln opens the door. Nicolay's standing there. \nJOHN NICOLAY Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hour ago, the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced. \nLincoln leaves with Nicolay. Mary watches, frozen, unable to let him go, knowing she can't stop him. \nINT. THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nThe telegraph office looks improvised, even after four years. Formerly the War Department library, it's lined with bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches. Telegraph cables stretch across the ceiling to the cipher-operators' desks. \nStanton, perpetually exhausted and impatient, storms down the stairs with Welles and the chief telegraph operator, MAJOR THOMAS ECKERT, 40, in his wake. \nSTANTON They cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault. Terry's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort! Why doesn't he answer my cables? \nWELLES MAJOR ECKERT Fort Fisher is a mountain of It's the largest fort they a building, Edwin. Twenty-two have, sir. They've been big seacoast guns on each reinforcing it for the last rampart - two years - \nThey reach the desks for the key operators. Among these, SAMUEL BECKWITH, 25, and the key manager, DAVID HOMER BATES, 22, sit at their silent keys, waiting to receive news. Stanton scribbles furiously on Beckwith's small notepad. \nSTANTON (CONT'D) They've taken 17,000 shells since yesterday! \nWELLES STANTON The commander is an old goat. I want to hear that Fort Fisher's ours and Wilmington MAJOR ECKERT has fallen! They said - \nSTANTON (CONT'D) Send another damn cable! \nStanton thrusts the cable at Beckwith, who taps it out immediately. \nStanton turns to a table where the large map of Wilmington from the Cabinet meeting is laid out, heavily scribbled-on. GUSTAVUS FOX, assistant Secretary of the Navy, and CHARLES BENJAMIN, Stanton's clerk, are checking the marks on the map against a stack of dispatches. \nSTANTON (CONT'D) The problem's their commander, Whiting. He engineered the fortress himself. The damned thing's his child; he'll defend it till his every last man is gone. He is not thinking rationally, he's - \nLINCOLN (O.C.) (hollering!) \"Come on out, you old rat!\" \nEveryone's startled, and confused. They all turn to Lincoln, who sits in Major Eckert's chair, wrapped in his shawl. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) That's what Ethan Allen called to the commander of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. \"Come on out, you old rat!\" `Course there were only forty- odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But, but there is one Ethan Allen story that I'm very partial to - \nSTANTON No! No, you're, you're going to tell a story! I don't believe that I can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now! \nASA VINTNER LITTON They'll be free, George! That's what'll become of them! What'll become of any of us?! That's what being free means! \nSchell, Latham, and Bilbo are perched in their usual gallery seats, taking notes. \nRICHARD SCHELL Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman switched. \nROBERT LATHAM (shaking his head:) Too publicly against us. He can't change course now. \nW.N. BILBO Not for some miserable little job anyways. \nGEORGE YEAMAN And, and! We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race - it would be inhuman not to! Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote? \nHe's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the chamber. \nGEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D) And, and! What shall follow upon that? Universal enfranchisement? Votes for women? \nYeaman is stopped, baffled and dismayed by the explosion he's provoked. \nINT. AN EMPTY COMMITTEE ROOM, THE CAPITOL - DAY \nHawkins enters and stops when he sees Pendleton and Wood. It's a trap. LeClerk follows, closing the door. \nFERNANDO WOOD Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post Master of Millersburg Ohio! \nHawkins looks at LeClerk, who guiltily avoids his glance. \nGEORGE PENDLETON Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to inform us. Of your disgusting betrayal. Your prostitution. \nFERNANDO WOOD Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins? Is your maidenly virtue for sale? \nHawkins sinks. \nEXT. A WOODS ALONG THE POTOMAC RIVER - MORNING \nBilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods. Bilbo, with his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges. \nCLAY HAWKINS My neighbors hear that I voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace, they will kill me. \nW.N. BILBO A deal's a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants just cause there's talk about peace talks. \nW.N. BILBO (CONT'D) CLAY HAWKINS My neighbors in Nashville, Look, I'll find another job. they found out I was loyal to the Union, they came after me with gelding knives! \nHawkins runs away from Bilbo. Bilbo chases him. CLAY HAWKINS W.N. BILBO (to himself, as he YOU DO RIGHT, CLAY HAWKINS! runs:) AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME MONEY Any other job. IN THE BARGAIN - \nCLAY HAWKINS (turning back to Bilbo:) I want to do right! But I got no courage!!! \nHawkins runs away, sobbing. Bilbo pursues. \nW.N. BILBO Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax man for the Western Reserve, hell you can have the whole state of Ohio if you - \nBilbo stops, winded. \nW.N. BILBO (CONT'D) Aw, crap. \nEXT. IN A BACK ALLEY, SOMEWHERE IN WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON \nSeward, smoking unhappily, strides toward his carriage, with Schell, Latham and Bilbo in pursuit. \nSEWARD Eleven votes?! Two days ago we had twelve!! What happened? \nRICHARD SCHELL ROBERT LATHAM It's the goddamned rumors There are defections in the regarding the Richmond ranks... Yes! The peace delegation. offer! \nSEWARD ROBERT LATHAM Groundless. I told you that. And yet the rumors persist. \nRICHARD SCHELL They are ruining us. \nRICHARD SCHELL Among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible there is a perceptible increase in resistance. \nSeward has reached the carriage, Bilbo alongside him. Before the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the carriage door. Seward is outraged. \nW.N. BILBO Resistance, hell! Thingamabob Hollister, Dem from Indiana? I approached him, the sumbitch near to murdered me! \nEXT. A STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT \nBilbo is talking to HAROLD HOLLISTER (D, IN), who pulls out a derringer. Bilbo bolts, dropping the folder. He stops, runs back, and bends to retrieve the folio as Hollister fires the gun over Bilbo's head. \nSEWARD \"...will have a bad influence. I will be sorry should it prove impossible for you to have an interview with them. I am awaiting your instructions. U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General Commanding Armies United States\" \nLincoln is in his coat, shawl over his shoulders, holding his hat. \nLINCOLN After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost. He believes we can end this war now. My trust in him is marrow deep. \nSeward looks up at Lincoln, then down again at the telegram. He stands and crosses to Lincoln. \nSEWARD You could bring the delegates to Washington. In exchange for the South's immediate surrender, we could promise them the amendment's defeat. They'd agree, don't you think? We'd end the war. This week. \nLincoln has closed his eyes. \nSEWARD (CONT'D) Or. If you could manage, without seeming to do it, to - \nLincoln shakes his head \"no.\" \nSEWARD (CONT'D) The peace delegation might encounter delays as they travel up the James River. Particularly with the fighting around Wilmington. Within ten days time, we might pass the Thirteenth Amendment. \nINT. HALLWAY, THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nLincoln, shawl still wrapped around him, walks the long empty hall. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nLincoln sits before an open window. He's dishevelled, in shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a candlestick, guttering. Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain, his open pocket watch. His bare left foot keeps time with the watch's loud ticking. He stares out into the cold night. \nINT. JOHN HAY AND JOHN NICOLAY'S BEDROOM - EVEN LATER \nThe room is spare and neat. Nicolay and Hay are asleep in their beds. \nLincoln is sitting at the foot of Hay's bed, spectacles on, reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand. \nLINCOLN Now, here's a sixteen year old boy. They're going to hang him... \nHay startles awake, then settles. He's used to this. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) (he reads a little FURTHER:) He was with the 15th Indiana Calvary near Beaufort, seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle. I don't think even Stanton would \ncomplain if I pardoned him? You think Stanton would complain? \nNicolay stirs in the next bed. \nJOHN HAY Ummm... I don't know, sir, I don't know who you're, uh... What time is it? \nLINCOLN It's three forty in the morning. \nJOHN NICOLAY (not waking up:) Don't... let him pardon any more deserters... \nNicolay's asleep again. \nJOHN HAY Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many. He's generally apoplectic on the subject - \nLINCOLN He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that - \nJOHN HAY Ask the horse what he thinks. \nLINCOLN - for cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left. (a beat, then:) Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington. \nJOHN HAY So... There are secesh delegates? \nLINCOLN (scribbling a note, signing the petition:) He was afraid, that's all it was. I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. What good would it do him? \nHe signs the pardon. Then he gives Hay's leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze. It hurts a little. Hay winces. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) War's nearly done. Ain't that so? What use one more corpse? Any more corpses? \nPutting the rest of the petitions on Hay's bed, he stands to leave. \nJOHN HAY Do you need company? \nINT. HALLWAY, THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nAs before, Lincoln continues his slow and solitary walk. \nLINCOLN (V.O.) Times like this, I'm best alone. \nLINCOLN (O.C.) What's the matter, Bob? \nRobert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth. \nROBERT I have to do this! And I will do it and I don't need your permission to enlist. \nLINCOLN That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? \"I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!\" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - \"I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man.\" \nROBERT It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed. \nLincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both. \nLincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns. \nROBERT (CONT'D) I have to do this! And I will! Or I will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life. Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter. And not just to other people, but to myself. I won't be you, pa. I can't do that. But I don't want to be nothing. \nHe hurries away. \nLINCOLN We can't lose you. \nINT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nOutside, driving rain and wind. Lincoln sits by the window, in his coat, vest and tie, hair combed neatly. \nLINCOLN He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant. \nMary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage. \nMARY The war will take our son! A sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll die, uselessly, and how will I ever forgive you? Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret! \nLINCOLN That's not true - \nMARY And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us! We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear BLOOD - \nLincoln rises from the window seat, angry. \nLINCOLN Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?! \nMARY (with a mocking smile:) And if I refuse to take the high road, if I won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie, when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me - \nLINCOLN MARY That's right. When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died! \nLINCOLN MARY - the child who was not only How dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief? \nLINCOLN MARY Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief! \nLINCOLN MARY And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! I ought to have done it, I ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse! \nMARY (CONT'D) THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you threaten me, you do it this time! Lock me away! You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed! \nSilence. Then: \nLINCOLN I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief. (BEAT:) I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose. \nShe opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room. \nINT. ODD FELLOWS' HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT \nOnstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night. MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing. The Lincolns, in their box, watch quietly. Elizabeth Keckley sits next to Mary. \nMary turns to Lincoln. They speak in whispers. Mrs. Keckley tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say. \nMARY You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done. When have I ever been so easily bamboozled? (BEAT) I believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war. And since you are sending my son into the war, woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment. \nLINCOLN Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town. \nMARY No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths. Seward can't do it. You must. Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me. \nEXT. THE PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE - A SHORT WHILE LATER \nThe carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage. \nShe hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln. \nELIZABETH KECKLEY I know the vote is only four days away; I know you're concerned. Thank you for your concern over this, and I want you to know: They'll approve it. God will see to it. \nW.N. BILBO Sure. \nLINCOLN Snagged my eye in the paper this morning. Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the - \nW.N. BILBO Pennsylvania 16th District. \nLINCOLN What a joy to be comprehended. Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor - \nSEWARD (looking askance at BILBO'S APPEARANCE:) Send Latham. Or Schell. \nLINCOLN (TO BILBO:) No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first. \nBilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs. \nROBERT LATHAM The incumbent is claiming he won it. Name of, uh... \nW.N. BILBO Coffroth. \nLINCOLN That's him. \nRICHARD SCHELL Coffroth. He is a Democrat. \nLINCOLN W.N. BILBO I understand he is. Silly name. Let Governor Curtin know it'd be much appreciated if he'd invite the House of Representatives to decide who won. He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it. (TO SCHELL:) Then advise Coffroth, if he hopes to retain his seat, that he'd better pay a visit to Thaddeus Stevens. \nSEWARD Pity poor Coffroth. \nINT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE, THE CAPITOL - NIGHT \nStevens is at his desk, paperwork piled high. There's a knock at the door. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS It opens! \nA nervous man enters hesitantly: Alexander Coffroth. \nStevens glares at him with what looks like horror. Coffroth's frightened smile transforms into a rictus of pain. Then: \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) You are Canfrey? \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Coffroth, Mr. Stevens, Alexander Coffroth, I'm, I'm - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (SKEPTICAL) Are we representatives of the same state? \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Y-yes sir! We sit only three desks APART - \nStevens waves him into a chair. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS I haven't noticed you. I'm a Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are a Democrat? \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Well, I... Um, that is to say... I - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson's political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party. You are a Dem-o-crat. What's the matter with you? Are you wicked? \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Well, I felt, um, formerly, I - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Never mind, Coffsnot. You were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in November's election by your worthy challenger, a REPUBLICAN - \nALEXANDER COFFROTH No, sir, I was not, um, trounced! Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I didn't lose the election - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS What difference does it make if you lost or not?! The governor of our state, is...? A Democrat? \nALEXANDER COFFROTH No, he's a... (baffled, terrified:) A, um, a Ruh... \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Re. \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Re. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (NODS) Pub. \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Pub. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Li. \nALEXANDER COFFROTH Li. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Can. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) My deepest sympathies to your family. \nLincoln goes back to his buggy. Hutton pauses at his door to watch Lincoln's buggy drive away. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLincoln is seated at the head of the cabinet table along with Seward. Ashley, Preston and Montgomery Blair. Hay and Nicolay sit in their usual chairs. \nPRESTON BLAIR (ANGRY:) We've managed our members to a fare- thee-well, you've had no defections from the Republican right to trouble you, whereas as to what you promised - Where the hell are the commissioners?! \nJAMES ASHLEY Oh God... (TO LINCOLN:) It's true! You, you...lied to me, Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests for a denial that, that there is a Confederate peace offer because, because there is one! We are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing - \nJAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) MONTGOMERY BLAIR - and we'll be discredited, We don't need a goddamned the amendment itself will be abolition amendment! Leave tainted. What if, what if the Constitution alone! State these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate - appear today? Or worse, on the morning - \nLINCOLN I can't listen to this anymore! I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it, I know I need this! This amendment is that cure! We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment! \nHe points around the table at Ashley, Monty, Preston. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Now now now! And you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters! See what is before you! See the here and now! That's the hardest thing, the only thing that accounts! Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come. Two votes stand in its way, and these votes must be procured. \nSEWARD We need two yeses, three abstentions, or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass - \nLINCOLN You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours! Now get the hell out of here and get `em! \nJAMES ASHLEY Yes but how? \nLINCOLN Buzzards' guts, man. \nLincoln rises, and keeps rising, till he seems eight feet tall. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) I am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me these votes. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAWN \nThe chamber is quiet and dark. Pages and clerks prepare the desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells. \nTITLE: THE MORNING OF THE VOTE \nJANUARY 31, 1865 \nA CLERK is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of representatives from seceded states. These will of course remain unoccupied during the vote. \nThe first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in. He goes to his desk and sits. He looks around the empty chamber, ready and waiting. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - MORNING, SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nThaddeus Stevens is at his desk. The House is in session, the floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing. \nThe balcony's packed. Mary and Keckley sit at the front, Nicolay and Hay behind them. The Blairs are among other officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries. \nThere's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. Ashley, Stevens and everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and Hawkins among these. \nIn the balcony, twenty WELL-TO-DO BLACK PEOPLE, mostly men, are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade, to a reserved section of the balcony. The black people glance at their surroundings but are rigidly composed. \nAsa Vintner Litton sees them enter. He looks about, at the representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors. Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with emotion, he calls up to the black visitors: \nASA VINTNER LITTON We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen, first in the history of this people's chamber, to your House! \nThere's tense applause. Some of the black guests bow; most aren't sure how to respond. \nYeaman watches this, deeply moved. \nBilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves. Hawkins looks anxiously around, blushing. \nEveryone is seated, and the place is packed. \nSchuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the SERGEANT-AT-ARMS to his right. Colfax gavels the House into session. Ashley is at the podium. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours. \nJAMES ASHLEY On the matter of the joint resolution before us, presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to our national Constitution, which was passed last year by the Senate, and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks. Today we will vote... \nCheers, boos, applause. \nJAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) By mutual agreement we shall hear brief final statements - \nW.N. BILBO You gonna have a chat now, with with the whole of the House of Representatives waiting on that? \nNicolay continues gasping, trying to speak. He can't. \nJOHN HAY (TO LINCOLN:) Making false representation to Congress is, it's, um - \nJOHN NICOLAY It's, it's - \nLINCOLN Impeachable. I've made no false representation. \nJOHN HAY But there are - (WHISPERING:) \nThere is a delegation from Richmond. \nLINCOLN Give me the note, Johnnie. \nHay gives Lincoln the note. Lincoln takes it, holding on to Hay's hand; with his free hand, Lincoln passes the note to Bilbo. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) (TO BILBO:) Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON \nBilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note, Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the podium. All eyes are on Ashley. \nJAMES ASHLEY From the President: \nThe chamber falls silent. \nJAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) \"So far as I know, there are no peace commissioners in the city nor are there likely to be.\" \nApplause, booing, furious discussion. \nGEORGE PENDLETON \"So far as I know-\"?! That means nothing! Are there commissioners from the South or aren't there?! \nIn the balcony, Mary looks to Mrs. Keckley. \nJAMES ASHLEY The President has answered you, sir! Your peace offer is a fiction! \nGEORGE PENDLETON That is not a denial, it is a lawyer's dodge! \nJAMES ASHLEY Mr. Haddam? Is your faction satisfied? \nPreston, in the balcony, hesitates. He looks at his daughter, who gives him a questioning look: \"Do you want this on your head?\" \nPreston doesn't. He indicates to Haddam with a small shake of his venerable head: \"Drop it.\" \nAARON HADDAM The conservative Republican faction's satisfied, and we thank Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr. Wood's motion. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX Tabled! \nThere's an angry response, but Wood and Pendleton sit, thwarted. \nJAMES ASHLEY Speaker Colfax, I order the main question. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX A motion has been made to bring the bill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote. Do I hear a second? \nASA VINTNER LITTON I second the motion. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX So moved, so ordered. The Clerk will now - (a rap of the gavel) Quiet please. \nThe noise of the chamber and balcony reduce to a rumble. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) The clerk will now call the roll for voting. \nThaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the moment has come. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE We begin with Connecticut. Mr. Augustus Benjamin, on the matter of this amendment, how say you? \nThe chamber is completely silent for the first time. \nAUGUSTUS BENJAMIN Nay! \nThe clerk records his vote. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Arthur Bentleigh. \nGrant turns his back on the proceedings to light a cigar. He's concerned at how close the vote is. Behind him the count CONTINUES: \nSERGEANT (CONT'D) Archibald Moran...yes. \nRobert has been looking at Grant; he returns to his score keeping. \nSERGEANT (CONT'D) Ambrose Bailer...yes. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON \nThe Clerk continues. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Walter H. Washburn. \nWALTER H. WASHBURN Votes no. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you? \nYeaman doesn't respond. The silence this causes lengthens, till representatives begin to look to see what's happened. Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding. Thaddeus Stevens, sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction. Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's inaudible. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D) Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn't hear you VOTE - \nGEORGE YEAMAN (rising to his feet) I said aye, Mr. McPherson. AYE!!! \nGreat surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts. \nFERNANDO WOOD TRAITOR! TRAITOR! \nYeaman looks ready to faint. To the consternation of the Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman, shaking his hand, slapping him on the back. Colfax bangs the gavel. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX Order! \nPendleton is speechless. Litton turns to Ashley, both astonished; Ashley turns to Stevens, who watches, sharp, observant, giving nothing away. \nMary updates her tally: \"8 TO WIN\" \nSCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) Order in the chamber! \nYeaman collapses back into his seat. The room quiets. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) Mr. MacPherson, you may proceed. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio. \nHawkins seems to have been startled out of a reverie. Sick with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name. He can't speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed. Hawkins snaps out of it. \nCLAY HAWKINS Goddamn it, I'm voting yes. \nA huge reaction to this. LeClerk gapes at Hawkins. \nCLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D) (right at Pendleton and Wood!) I don't care, shoot me dead! You shoot me dead I, I am voting yes! \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk. \nLeClerk, seated next to Hawkins and transfixed by his courage, turns dazedly to McPherson. \nEDWIN LECLERK No. (then, standing abruptly:) Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead too. Yes! \nThe noise gets wilder. Pendleton fixes LeClerk and Hawkins with a murderous look. \nEDWIN LECLERK (CONT'D) I mean, abstention. Abstention. \nDisgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this means for the vote count. \nIn the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Alexander Coffroth. \nCoffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him. \nALEXANDER COFFROTH (proud of himself and happy about the reward HE'LL GET:) I. Vote. Yes. \nApplause. Stevens still doesn't look at Coffroth, but, tickled, he grins and nods. \nINT. GRANT'S TELEGRAPH ROOM AT CITY POINT - AFTERNOON \nLaughter in the chamber. The Clerk tallies the vote, then passes the recorded vote to the Speaker. There's absolute silence. \nIn the balcony, Mary checks her own tally, not quite believing it. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) The final vote: eight absent or not voting, fifty six votes against, one hundred nineteen votes for. With a margin of two votes - \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nLincoln stands, waiting. The only sound is the ticking of the clock. And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as bells begin to peal throughout the city. Lincoln raises the window as Tad rushes to him. The bells are joined by a cannonade. The sound of jubilation fills his office. \nLincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly, seeking out the source of the noise. Lincoln puts his hand on Tad's head. He looks down at his son, silent. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE AFTERNOON \nRepresentatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep, shout, dance, climb on desks. In the balcony, Mary stands slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs. Keckley stands with her, smiling, crying. Preston Blair applauds vigorously. The black visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some praying, others embracing and weeping. \nLatham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone. \nAshley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room, as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing \"The Battle Cry of Freedom.\" \nPendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder. Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House. \nYeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing. \nStevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a folio. He looks up. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...? \nThe Clerk hands the bill to Stevens, who folds it and pockets it. \nTHE CLERK OF THE HOUSE That's...That's the official bill. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS I'll return it in the morning. Creased, but unharmed. \nEXT. A STREET, WASHINGTON - DUSK \nCelebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment. \nThaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction, making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl utterly at odds with the prevailing festive mood. \nHe reaches a modest house, unlocks the door and steps inside. \nINT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nStevens is met at the door by LYDIA SMITH, a black woman in her fifties. As she helps him off with his coat, he takes a piece of paper from his pocket. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS A gift for you. \nShe takes it. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) The greatest measure of the Nineteenth Century. Passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America. \nINT. THE BEDROOM IN THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nStevens, in his nightgown, takes off his wig. He's bald. \nHe lies down in bed. Mrs. Smith is in bed already beside him. She's holding the paper he gave her. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS I wish you'd been present. \nLYDIA SMITH I wish I'd been. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS It was a spectacle. \nLYDIA SMITH You can't bring your housekeeper to the House. I won't give them gossip. (THE PAPER) This is enough. This is... It's more than enough for now. \nThey kiss. He lies back. He grabs her hand. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Read it to me again, my love. \nLYDIA SMITH \"PROPOSED -\" \nTHADDEUS STEVENS And adopted. \nAs Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle. \nHe reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg. \nEXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING \nGrant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln, in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his eyes. \nHe has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused with grey. His brow has grown smoother. \nLINCOLN Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops. \nGRANT Yes sir, as we discussed. \nLINCOLN Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none. \nWhen peace comes it mustn't just be hangings. \nGRANT By outward appearance, you're ten years older than you were a year ago. \nLINCOLN Some weariness has bit at my bones. (BEAT) I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before. \nGRANT You always knew that, what this was going to be. Intimate, and ugly. You must've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here. \nLINCOLN We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things. \nGRANT And we've won the war. Now you have to lead us out of it. \nEXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA - AFTERNOON \nOFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's just happened. No one is speaking. \nTITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA \nAPRIL 9, 1865 \nROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse. \nLee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside; but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions: pride, defiance, blankness. \nGrant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln. \nGrant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another. \nThen Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union Army remove their hats. \nLee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away. \nEXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON \nA beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in the buggy, driven by the old soldier. \nMARY You've an itch to travel? \nLINCOLN I'd like that. To the West by rail. \nMARY (shaking her head no:) Overseas. \nLINCOLN The Holy Land. \nMARY (a laugh, then:) Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday. \nLINCOLN Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city. \nShe seems sadder. They ride in silence. \nMARY All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined your happiness. \nLINCOLN Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly. \nShe nods; then, tenderly: \nMARY When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it. They'll wonder at you. They should. But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like. For an ordinary person. For anyone other than you. \nLincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him. \n", "test1_input": "STANTON A hundred shells a minute. \nThere's a moment of shocked silence. \nSTANTON (CONT'D) Till they surrender. \nWILLIAM FESSENDEN Dear God. \nWELLES Yes. Yes. \nLINCOLN Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore... \nSTANTON Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after. \nSEWARD And the war... is done. \nThe rest of the cabinet applauds, foot stomping, table slapping. Only John Usher doesn't join in. \nJOHN USHER Then why, if I may ask are we not concentrating the nation's attention on Wilmington? Why, instead, are we reading in the HERALD - (he smacks a newspaper on THE TABLE) - that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the House floor for debate - because your eagerness, in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive into Legislative prerogatives, is compelling it to it's... to what's likely to be its premature demise? You signed the Emancipation Proclamation, you've done all that can be expected - \nJAMES SPEED The Emancipation Proclamation's merely a war measure. After the war the courts'll make a meal of it. \nJOHN USHER When Edward Bates was Attorney General, he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign - \nJAMES SPEED (A SHRUG:) Different lawyers, different opinions. It frees slaves as a military exigent, not in any other - \nLINCOLN I don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal. Somewhere's in between. Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83. He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire- \nwood and fractured his skull, `n he died. In his will he wrote \"I expect she has killed me. If I get over it, I will have revenge.\" \nThis gets a laugh. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) No one was keen to see her convicted, he was that kind of husband. I asked the prosecuting attorney if I might have a short conference with my client. And she and I went into a room in the courthouse, but I alone emerged. The window in the room was found to be wide open. It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it. I told the bailiff right before I left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water, and I told her Tennessee. Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora. Enough justice had been done; they even forgave the bondsman her bail. \nJOHN USHER I'm afraid I don't - \nLINCOLN I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which I decided meant that I could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. Of course I don't, never have, I'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... Why I caught at the opportunity. Now here's where it gets truly slippery. I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and \ncitizens of belligerent nations. But the South ain't a nation, that's why I can't negotiate with 'em. So if in fact the Negroes are property according to law, have I the right to take the rebels' property from `em, if I insist they're rebels only, and not citizens of a belligerent country? And slipperier still: I maintain it ain't our actual Southern states in rebellion, but only the rebels living in those states, the laws of which states remain in force. The laws of which states remain in force. That means, that since it's states' laws that determine whether Negroes can be sold as slaves, as property - the Federal government doesn't have a say in that, least not yet - (a glance at Seward, THEN:) - then Negroes in those states are slaves, hence property, hence my war powers allow me to confiscate `em as such. So I confiscated `em. But if I'm a respecter of states' laws, how then can I legally free `em with my Proclamation, as I done, unless I'm cancelling states' laws? I felt the war demanded it; my oath demanded it; I felt right with myself; and I hoped it was legal to do it, I'm hoping still. \nHe looks around the table. Everyone's listening. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Two years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated - \"then, thenceforward and forever free.\" But let's say the courts decide I had no authority to do it. They might well decide that. Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery. Say it's after the war, and I can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions, like I sometimes felt I had to do. Might those people I freed be ordered back into slavery? That's why I'd like to get the Thirteenth Amendment through the House, and on \nits way to ratification by the states, wrap the whole slavery thing up, forever and aye. As soon as I'm able. Now. End of this month. And I'd like you to stand behind me. Like my cabinet's most always done. \nA moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) As the preacher said, I could write shorter sermons but once I start I get too lazy to stop. \nJOHN USHER It seems to me, sir, you're describing precisely the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about. \nJAMES SPEED Dictators aren't susceptible to law. \nJOHN USHER Neither is he! He just said as much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting meanings? What reins him in from, from... \nLINCOLN Well, the people do that, I suppose. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election. I felt I was within my power to do it; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that; I knew the people would tell me. I gave `em a year and half to think about it. And they re- elected me. (BEAT) And come February the first, I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON \nNicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit perpetually worried JAMES ASHLEY, 42, (R, OH). Tad eyes him from a chair by the window. \nLincoln enters the room with Seward. \nLINCOLN Well, Mr. Representative Ashley! Tell us the news from the Hill. \nLincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated but flattered representative on the shoulder. \nJAMES ASHLEY Well! Ah! News - \nLINCOLN Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness? \nJAMES ASHLEY I... \nSEWARD James, we want you to bring the anti-slavery amendment to the floor for debate - \n", "test1_true": "JAMES ASHLEY I am, of course - But - Immediately? \nSEWARD And we're counting on robust radical support, so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him to put his back into it, it's not going to be easy, but we trust - \nJAMES ASHLEY It's impossible. No, I am sorry, no, we can't organize anything immediately in the House. I have been canvassing the Democrats since the election, in case any of them softened after they got walloped. But they have stiffened if anything, Mr. Secretary. There aren't nearly enough votes - \nLINCOLN We're whalers, Mr. Ashley! \nJAMES ASHLEY Whalers? As in, um, whales? \nLincoln moves in, standing very close to Ashley. \nLINCOLN We've been chasing this whale for a long time. We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back. It's in, James, it's in! We finish the deed now, we can't wait! Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity! \nSEWARD On the 31st of this month. Of this year. Put the amendment up for a vote. \nAshley is agog. \nINT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL - EVENING \nThe room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of Robespierre, a print of Tom Paine), long occupancy and hard work. On the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded banner: \"RE-ELECT THADDEUS STEVENS, REPUBLICAN TICKET, 9TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, LANCASTER PENNSYLVANIA\". At the desk sits THADDEUS STEVENS (R, PA), 73, bald under a horrible red wig, a gaunt, powerful face resembling Lincoln's, though beardless and bitter. \nIn the office are Ashley, Speaker of the House SCHUYLER COLFAX (R, IN), formidable Senator BLUFF WADE (R, MA), who's never smiled, and ASA VINTNER LITTON (R, MD). \nBLUFF WADE Whalers? \nJAMES ASHLEY That's what he said. \nBLUFF WADE The man's never been near a whale ship in his life! (TO STEVENS:) Withdraw radical support, force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to - He drags his feet about everything, Lincoln; why this urgency? We got it through the Senate without difficulty because \nwe had the numbers. Come December you'll have the same in the House. The amendment'll be the easy work of ten minutes. \nASA VINTNER LITTON He's using the threat of the amendment to frighten the rebels into an immediate surrender. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX I imagine we'd rejoice to see that. \nASA VINTNER LITTON Will you rejoice when the Southern states have re-joined the Union, pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them to, and one by one each refuses to ratify the amendment? If we pass it, which we won't. (TO STEVENS:) Why are we co-operating with, with him? We all know what he's doing and we all know what he'll do. We can't offer up abolition's best legal prayer to his games and tricks. \nBLUFF WADE He's said he'd welcome the South back with all its slaves in chains. \nJAMES ASHLEY Three years ago he said that! To calm the border states when we were- \nTHADDEUS STEVENS I don't. \nThis confuses the room. Stevens turns to Vintner Litton. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) You said \"we all know what he'll do.\" I don't know. \nASA VINTNER LITTON You know he isn't to be trusted. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Trust? I'm sorry, I was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics. I've never trusted the President. I never \ntrust anyone. But... Hasn't he surprised you? \nASA VINTNER LITTON No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Nothing surprises you, Asa, therefore nothing about you is surprising. Perhaps that is why your constituents did not re-elect you to the coming term. (collecting his cane and STANDING:) It's late, I'm old, I'm going home. \nStevens limps to the door, opens it, and turns. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) Lincoln the inveterate dawdler, Lincoln the Southerner, Lincoln the capitulating compromiser, our adversary - and leader of the godforsaken Republican Party, our party - Abraham Lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery in America. (BEAT:) Retain, even in opposition, your capacity for astonishment. \nStevens leaves, shutting the door. They watch him go, Ashley excited, Litton unmoved, insulted, skeptical. \nINT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM, OLD TAVERN IN WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT \nIn a cramped private alcove, a low, sagging timber ceiling, sooty walls, sawdusted floor, ancient curtain closing it off, Seward sits at a small table with ROBERT LATHAM, an Albany NY political operative, RICHARD SCHELL, a Wall Street speculator, and W.N. BILBO, a Tennessee lawyer and lobbyist. A chandelier with candles drips wax on them. \nOn the table, a leather folio lies open: prospectuses for jobs in the administration. Latham and Schell study these. Bilbo is studying Seward. \nSEWARD The President is never to be mentioned. Nor I. You're paid for your discretion. \nW.N. BILBO Hell, you can have that for nothin', what we need money for is bribes. It'd speed things up. \n", "test2_input": "WILLIAM SLADE I was born a free man. Nobody beat me except I beat them right back. \nThere's a knock on the door and Mrs. Keckley enters. \nELIZABETH KECKLEY Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me- \nWILLIAM SLADE (TO TAD:) Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her if she was beaten. \nTAD LINCOLN Were you - (shakes his head) Tad. \nELIZABETH KECKLEY (TO TAD:) I was beaten with a fire shovel when I was younger than you. (TO LINCOLN:) You should go to Mrs. Lincoln. She's in Willie's room. \nROBERT She never goes in there. \nLincoln starts towards the door just as John Hay enters, dressed in the uniform of a Brevet Colonel. \nJOHN HAY The reception line is already stretching out the door. \nRobert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as Lincoln, Slade, Mrs. Keckley and Hay leave. Robert calls to HIS FATHER: \nROBERT I'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five in this whole place not in uniform. \nTAD I'm under fifteen and I have a uniform. \nRobert storms out. \nINT. THE PRINCE OF WALES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against the dim afternoon light. There are two beds. One is stripped bare. The other is canopied with a thick black veil. \nMary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is seated at the head of the canopied bed. On a nightstand next to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book of B&O railroad schedules. \nMary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12, handsome, bright-eyed, confident. \nLincoln crosses to the window. \nMARY My head hurts so. (BEAT) I prayed for death the night Willie died. The headaches are how I know I didn't get my wish. How to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night. \nLINCOLN I know. \nMARY Trying not to think about him. How will I manage? \nLINCOLN Somehow you will. \nMARY (SAD SMILE:) Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every party, every... And now, four years more in this terrible house reproaching us. He was a very sick little boy. We should've cancelled that reception, shouldn't we? \nLINCOLN We didn't know how sick he was. \nMARY I knew, I knew, I saw that night he was dying. \nLINCOLN Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face. \nMARY But I saw Willie was dying. I saw HIM - \nHe bends and kisses her hand. \nLINCOLN Molly. It's too hard. Too hard. \nMary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief. \nINT. THE EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nMary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower, is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving line. The Blairs proceed from Mary to Lincoln. \nTITLE: GRAND RECEPTION \nJANUARY 15 \nThe enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions. An orchestra plays. \nLincoln and Tad stand together. Slade is near Lincoln. Mary's a distance away from Lincoln, to his right. \nRobert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes. \nA sea of people surround the President and his family. Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and many officers and soldiers. \n", "test2_true": "He's bothered only by the white kid gloves he's wearing. He tugs at the right-hand glove. \nWILLIAM SLADE (with a glance in Mary's) She's just ten feet yonder. I'd like to keep my job. \nLincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking hand - but keeps the other glove on. \nApproaching Mary on the line, Stevens, Ashley, Senators Bluff Wade and CHARLES SUMNER, all in formal wear except Stevens. \nMARY Senator Sumner, it has been much too long. \nCHARLES SUMNER \"Oh, who can look on that celestial face and -\" \nCutting him off, she pretends not to recognize Ashley. \nMARY And...? \nJAMES ASHLEY (CONFUSED) James Ashley, ma'am, we've met several times - \nBut she ignores him and greets Stevens. \nMARY (her Southern accent becoming more lustrous:) Praise Heavens, praise Heavens, just when I had abandoned hope of amusement, it's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee! \nStevens bows to her. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Mrs. Lincoln. \nMARY Madame President if you please! (LAUGHS) Oh, don't convene another subcommittee to investigate me, sir! I'm teasing! Smile, Senator Wade. \nBLUFF WADE (NOT SMILING:) I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln. \nMARY I'll take your word for that, sir! \nTHADDEUS STEVENS As long as your household accounts are in order, Madame, we'll have no need to investigate them. \nMARY You have always taken such a lively, even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Your household accounts have always been so interesting. \nMARY Yes, thank you, it's true, the miracles I have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices. But I had to! Four years ago, when the President and I arrived, this was pure pigsty. Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets. Mushrooms, green as the moon, sprouting from ceilings! And a pauper's pittance allotted for improvements. As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting, in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor, further proof that my husband and I were prairie primitives, unsuited to the position to which an error of the people, a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us. \nLincoln, suddenly without anyone in line to receive, looks to see the backlog forming behind the radicals. He notes the exchange, but says nothing. Robert sees him looking. \nMARY (CONT'D) The past is the past, it's a new year now and we are all getting along, or so they tell me. I gather we are working together! The White House and the other House? Hatching little plans together? \nRobert leans in to her. \nROBERT Mother? \nMARY What? \nROBERT You're creating a bottleneck. \nMARY Oh! (TO STEVENS:) Oh, I'm detaining you, and more important, the people behind you! How the people love my husband, they flock to see him, by their thousands on public days! They will never love you the way they love him. How difficult it must be for you to know that. And yet how important to remember it. \nShe gives him a slight, lethal smile. He holds the look; his poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and perhaps a little admiring. \nINT. THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING \nThe kitchen's piled with unwashed cookware, eggshells, flour bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is still underway upstairs. Music, the tramp of dancing feet and rhythmic clapping is audible. \nA BLACK FOOTMAN carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and cups comes down the stairs. He hastily beats a retreat when he sees Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens quietly talking amid the mess. \nLINCOLN Since we have the floor next in the debate, I thought I'd suggest you might...temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends? \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Ashley insists you're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving Democrats. \nLINCOLN I can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS When the war ends, I intend to push for full equality, the Negro vote and much more. Congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property. We'll use their confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free Negro farmers, and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors. We'll build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom. The nation needs to know that we have such plans. \nLINCOLN That's the untempered version of reconstruction. It's not... It's not exactly what I intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time. Now we're working together, and I'm asking you - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS For patience, I expect. \n", "test3_input": "INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATER \nStevens, at the podium, is being challenged by Fernando Wood, standing at his desk. \nFERNANDO WOOD I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens, and you must answer me. Do you or do you not hold that the precept that \"all men are created equal\" is meant literally? \nAll eyes are on Stevens, the chamber quiet except for a scratching sound: the journalists have begun scribbling. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) Is that not the true purpose of the amendment? To promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate - \nTHADDEUS STEVENS The true purpose of the amendment, Mr. Wood, you perfectly-named, brainless, obstructive object? \nFERNANDO WOOD You have always insisted, Mr. Stevens, that Negroes are the same as white men are. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS The true purpose of the amendment - \nStevens looks up at the balcony, at the waiting journalists, and Mary, who raises her eyebrows, then at Ashley and Litton at their desks. Seward watches from the balcony. \nStevens returns to Wood. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) I don't hold with equality in all things only with equality before the law and nothing more. \nFERNANDO WOOD (SURPRISED:) That's not so! You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men. You've said it a thousand TIMES - \nGEORGE PENDLETON (leaping to his feet) For shame! For shame! Stop prevaricating and answer Representative Wood! \nTHADDEUS STEVENS GEORGE PENDLETON I don't hold with equality in (stands:) all things, only with After the decades of fervent equality before the law and advocacy on behalf of the nothing more. colored race - \nJAMES ASHLEY (LEAPING UP:) He's answered your questions! This amendment has naught to do with race equality! \nPendleton persists, through cheers and catcalls. \nGEORGE PENDLETON THADDEUS STEVENS You have long insisted, have I don't hold with equality in you not, that the dusk- all things only with equality colored race is no different before the law and nothing from the white one. more. \nAmong the amendment's supporters, including Vintner Litton, a GROUP OF WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS in the balcony, and Elizabeth Keckley, there's visible, audible shock and dismay at Stevens's capitulation. Mary's surprised by Stevens, and impressed. \nMARY (whispering to Mrs. KECKLEY:) Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control? He might make a politician someday - \nELIZABETH KECKLEY (STANDING ABRUPTLY:) I need to go. \nMary's startled. Mrs. Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing past journalists. On the floor: \nGEORGE PENDLETON Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative. It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man! \nTHADDEUS STEVENS (giving in to his anger:) How can I hold that all men are created equal, when here before me - (pointing to Pendleton:) - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood! You are more reptile than man, George, so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you! \nGeneral uproar. \nGEORGE PENDLETON HOW DARE YOU! \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Yet even you, Pendleton, who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today, even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law! And so again, sir, and again and again and \nagain I say: I DO NOT HOLD WITH EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS. ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. \nAshley sits, nearly weeping with relief, while the chamber explodes: laughter, applause, boos. \nGEORGE PENDLETON MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO THREATEN ME AND - \nThe journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it. \nStevens limps out through the aisle to wild Republican applause. He looks up to the balcony; Mary is looking down approvingly. He looks down before she can see him smile. \nINT. A CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER - LATER \nStevens sits on a bench, alone, thinking, troubled. Asa Vintner Litton approaches him. \nASA VINTNER LITTON You asked if ever I was surprised. \nStevens nods. \nASA VINTNER LITTON (CONT'D) Today, Mr. Stevens, I was surprised. You've led the battle for race equality for thirty years! The basis of, of every hope for this country's future life, you denied Negro equality! I'm nauseated. You refused to say that all humans are, well... human! Have you lost your very soul, Mr. Stevens? Is there nothing you won't say? \nStevens nods, then, quietly: \nTHADDEUS STEVENS I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa, that must be unpleasant. I want the amendment to pass. So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition. For this amendment, for which I have worked all of my life and for which \n", "test3_true": "EXT. THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON - MORNING \nLincoln and Robert are in the buggy driven by the old soldier; a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver, his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs. Lincoln is on one side reading over a stack of documents. Robert's on the other side of the buggy, staring sullenly at his feet. \nThe buggy stops outside an army hospital. Lincoln packs up his papers. \nROBERT I'm not going in. \nLINCOLN You said you wanted to help me. \nROBERT This is - This is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement. I've been to army hospitals, I've seen surgeries, I went and visited the malaria barges with mama. \nLINCOLN She told me she didn't take you inside. \nROBERT I snuck in after - I've seen what it's like. This changes nothing. \nLINCOLN At all rates, I'm happy to have your company. \nStepping out of the buggy, he hands his folio to the bodyguard and enters the army hospital. \nINT. ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING \nHe's met in the antechamber by an ARMY SURGEON. \nLINCOLN Morning, Jim. \nARMY SURGEON Hello, Mr. President. \nLINCOLN Good to see you again. \nThey move into the main ward, Lincoln removing his hat. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Well, boys, first question: You getting enough to eat? \nHe walks from bed to bed, shaking hands with each patient. Most are amputees. \nFIRST PATIENT Hello, sir. \nLINCOLN What's your name, soldier? \nFIRST PATIENT Robert. \nLINCOLN Robert. Good to meet you, Robert. \nSECOND PATIENT Nice to meet you. \nLINCOLN What's your name? \nSECOND PATIENT Kevin. \nLINCOLN Tell me your names as I go past. I like to know who I'm talkin' to. Kevin. \nTHIRD PATIENT Mr. President. John. \nLINCOLN John. I've seen you before. \nFOURTH PATIENT Mr. President... \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING \nRobert, brooding, waits in the buggy. \nHearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over. \nRobert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a corner of the building. \nBehind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back, revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered by bullet or bomb. \nRobert watches as they toss the remains into the pit. Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs. \nRobert walks away, unsteady. \nAround the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed. Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold back tears. \n"}

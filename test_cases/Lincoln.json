FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY \nA gavel slams down on a sounding block in an attempt to silence the raucous tumult in the large chamber. It subsides enough for Colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central DAIS: \nSCHUYLER COLFAX The House recognizes Fernando Wood, the honorable representative from New York. \nTITLE: THE HOUSE DEBATE BEGINS \nJANUARY 9 \nFloor and balcony are full, although the desks of representatives from seceded states are bare and unoccupied. \nOn the Democratic side, 81 members applaud FERNANDO WOOD (D, NY) as he takes the podium. The Democratic leadership, including GEORGE YEAMAN (KY), has gathered around House minority leader GEORGE PENDLETON(OH). On the Republican side of the aisle, enraged booing from the 102 Republicans, including HIRAM PRICE (IA), GEORGE JULIAN (IN), Vintner Litton and Ashley, all gathered around Stevens's desk. \nFERNANDO WOOD Estimable colleagues.

Mary turns her gaze from the floor to watch Latham and Schell, a few seats away, scrutinize the floor, whispering, Latham taking notes. Schell holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap. Bilbo sits behind them. \nThey study the other NY Democrats - CHARLES HANSON, NELSON MERRICK, HENRY LANFORD, HOMER BENSON, GILES STUART - who \ncomprise a cluster of glum uncomfortable passivity on that side of the aisle. \nFERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM He claimed, as tyrants do, (whispering to Schell:) that the war's emergencies The New York delegation's permitted him to turn our looking decidedly uninspired. army into the unwilling instrument of his monarchical AMBITIONS - \nWood points at Stevens, granite-faced.

They've lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting, laughing, clapping and cheering, egging on Tad as, with furious concentration, he drives a cart pulled at considerable speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down \nthe hall. White House doorkeeper and unofficial child-minder TOM PENDEL follows, admonishing the petitioners as he goes. \nTOM PENDEL Please don't encourage this! Don't encourage this! \nROBERT LINCOLN, 21, enters from the stairs carrying several pieces of large and heavy luggage. \nTad sees him, jumps out of the goat cart, runs up to and tackles Robert, causing him to drop his luggage. They embrace as Pendel captures the goat and leads it away. \nTAD You're back you're back you're back you're back you're - \nROBERT (LAUGHING) I am. Your goat got big. \nRobert disentangles himself from Tad and hands him a suitcase. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Here, help me get one of these to my room. (a nervous glance at the door to Mary's bedroom SUITE:) Is she in there? \nAs Robert hoists the rest of the luggage himself, Tad chatters and A PETITIONER comes forward.

I don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want! This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of `em. And I look a lot worse without the wig. The people elected me! To represent them! To lead them! And I lead! You ought to try it! \nLINCOLN I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I have tried to profit from the example of it. But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America. \nStevens glares at him, then smiles. \nTHADDEUS STEVENS Oh, how you have longed to say that to me. You claim you trust them - but you know what the people are. You know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery. White people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with Negroes. \nLincoln reaches over to Stevens and gives his shoulder a vigorous shake. Stevens endures this. \nLINCOLN A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice \nabout the swamps and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way. If in pursuit of your destination you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North? \nINT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nSpectacles on, Lincoln unlaces Mary's corset. \nLINCOLN Robert's going to plead with us to let him enlist. \nHe's unlaced enough; she unhooks the front and steps out of her corset and petticoats, turns to him in her plain thin chemise and drawers. \nMARY Make time to talk to Robbie. You only have time for Tad. \nLINCOLN Tad's young. \nMARY So's Robert. Too young for the army. \nLINCOLN Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up... \nMARY Don't take Robbie. Don't let me lose my son. \nThere's a knock on the door. Mary turns to it, furious: \nMARY (CONT'D) Go away! We're occupied! \nLincoln opens the door. Nicolay's standing there. \nJOHN NICOLAY Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hour ago, the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced. \nLincoln leaves with Nicolay. Mary watches, frozen, unable to let him go, knowing she can't stop him. \nINT. THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nThe telegraph office looks improvised, even after four years. Formerly the War Department library, it's lined with bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches. Telegraph cables stretch across the ceiling to the cipher-operators' desks. \nStanton, perpetually exhausted and impatient, storms down the stairs with Welles and the chief telegraph operator, MAJOR THOMAS ECKERT, 40, in his wake. \nSTANTON They cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault. Terry's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort! Why doesn't he answer my cables? \nWELLES MAJOR ECKERT Fort Fisher is a mountain of It's the largest fort they a building, Edwin. Twenty-two have, sir. They've been big seacoast guns on each reinforcing it for the last rampart - two years - \nThey reach the desks for the key operators. Among these, SAMUEL BECKWITH, 25, and the key manager, DAVID HOMER BATES, 22, sit at their silent keys, waiting to receive news. Stanton scribbles furiously on Beckwith's small notepad. \nSTANTON (CONT'D) They've taken 17,000 shells since yesterday! \nWELLES STANTON The commander is an old goat. I want to hear that Fort Fisher's ours and Wilmington MAJOR ECKERT has fallen! They said - \nSTANTON (CONT'D) Send another damn cable! \nStanton thrusts the cable at Beckwith, who taps it out immediately. \nStanton turns to a table where the large map of Wilmington from the Cabinet meeting is laid out, heavily scribbled-on. GUSTAVUS FOX, assistant Secretary of the Navy, and CHARLES BENJAMIN, Stanton's clerk, are checking the marks on the map against a stack of dispatches. \nSTANTON (CONT'D) The problem's their commander, Whiting. He engineered the fortress himself. The damned thing's his child; he'll defend it till his every last man is gone. He is not thinking rationally, he's - \nLINCOLN (O.C.) (hollering!) \"Come on out, you old rat!\" \nEveryone's startled, and confused. They all turn to Lincoln, who sits in Major Eckert's chair, wrapped in his shawl. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) That's what Ethan Allen called to the commander of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. \"Come on out, you old rat!\" `Course there were only forty- odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But, but there is one Ethan Allen story that I'm very partial to - \nSTANTON No! No, you're, you're going to tell a story! I don't believe that I can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now! \n", "test2_true": "STANTON (CONT'D) I need the B&O sideyard schedules for Alexandria! I asked for them this morning! \nLincoln pays no attention to Stanton's fulminations and continues with his story. \nLINCOLN It was right after the Revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king. The English sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord. Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and Mr. Allen found he needed the \nprivy. He was grateful to be directed thence - relieved you might say. \nEveryone laughs. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Now, Mr. Allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of George Washington. Ethan Allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room. His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait. And finally His Lordship couldn't resist, and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it, the picture of Washington. He had. Well, what did he think of its placement, did it seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen? Mr. Allen said it did. His host was astounded! Appropriate? George Washington's likeness in a water closet? Yes, said Mr. Allen, where it'll do good service: the whole world knows nothing'll make an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington. \nEveryone laughs. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) I love that story. \nBeckwith's and Bates's keys starts clicking. They transcribe furiously. \nThere's a general rush to the operators' desks. Lincoln walks quickly over, and is joined there by Stanton, who arrives just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being decoded. Stanton and Lincoln hold hands, as they've done many times, waiting for news of the battle. \nBates hands the decoded cable to Benjamin, who reads it quickly, then announces to the room: \nCHARLES BENJAMIN Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken the port. \nWELLES And Wilmington? \nEckert shakes his head as Beckwith hands him the next telegram. \nMAJOR ECKERT We've taken the fort, but the city of Wilmington has not surrendered. \nA beat as this sinks in. Then: \nSTANTON How many casualties? \nEckert looks up at Stanton and Lincoln, stricken. \nINT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY \nOne representative's reading a paper with the headline: THE FALLEN AT WILMINGTON, followed by hundreds of names. \nPendleton and Wood are conferring. \nFERNANDO WOOD Heavy losses. \nGEORGE PENDLETON And more to come. \nFERNANDO WOOD Sours the national mood. That might suffice to discourage him - \nGEORGE PENDLETON To what? To bring this down? Not in a fight like this. This is to the death. \nFERNANDO WOOD It's gruesome! \nGEORGE PENDLETON (GETTING UPSET:) Are you despairing, or merely lazy? This fight is for The United States of America! Nothing \"suffices\". A rumor? Nothing! They're not lazy! They're busily buying votes! While we hope to be saved by \"the national mood?!\" \nHe looks over at Stevens, who's at his desk consulting with Ashley and Julian. \nGEORGE PENDLETON (CONT'D) Before this blood is dry, when Stevens next takes the floor, taunt him - you excel at that - get him to proclaim what we all know he believes in his coal-colored heart: that this vote is meant to set the black race on high, to niggerate America. \nFERNANDO WOOD George, please. Stay on course. \nGEORGE PENDLETON Bring Stevens to full froth. I can ensure that every newspaperman from Louisville to San Francisco will be here to witness it and print it. \nColfax gavels the chamber to order, as George Yeaman approaches the podium. \nSCHUYLER COLFAX The floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman. \nGEORGE YEAMAN I thank you, Speaker Colfax. \nThe Democrats applaud as Yeaman takes his place at the podium and surveys the chamber. \nGEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D) Although I'm disgusted by slavery I rise on this sad and solemn day to announce that I'm opposed to the amendment. We must consider what will become of colored folk if four million are in one instant set free. \nCheers and boos. \n", "test2_id": 1882, "test3_input": "SEWARD \"...will have a bad influence.

Particularly with the fighting around Wilmington. Within ten days time, we might pass the Thirteenth Amendment. \nINT. HALLWAY, THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nLincoln, shawl still wrapped around him, walks the long empty hall. \nINT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nLincoln sits before an open window. He's dishevelled, in shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a candlestick, guttering. Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain, his open pocket watch. His bare left foot keeps time with the watch's loud ticking. He stares out into the cold night. \nINT. JOHN HAY AND JOHN NICOLAY'S BEDROOM - EVEN LATER \nThe room is spare and neat. Nicolay and Hay are asleep in their beds. \nLincoln is sitting at the foot of Hay's bed, spectacles on, reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand. \nLINCOLN Now, here's a sixteen year old boy. They're going to hang him... \nHay startles awake, then settles. He's used to this. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) (he reads a little FURTHER:) He was with the 15th Indiana Calvary near Beaufort, seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle. I don't think even Stanton would \ncomplain if I pardoned him? You think Stanton would complain? \nNicolay stirs in the next bed. \nJOHN HAY Ummm... I don't know, sir, I don't know who you're, uh... What time is it? \nLINCOLN It's three forty in the morning. \nJOHN NICOLAY (not waking up:) Don't... let him pardon any more deserters... \nNicolay's asleep again. \nJOHN HAY Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many. He's generally apoplectic on the subject - \nLINCOLN He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that - \nJOHN HAY Ask the horse what he thinks. \nLINCOLN - for cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left. (a beat, then:) Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington. \nJOHN HAY So... There are secesh delegates? \nLINCOLN (scribbling a note, signing the petition:) He was afraid, that's all it was. I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. What good would it do him? \nHe signs the pardon. Then he gives Hay's leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze. It hurts a little. Hay winces. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) War's nearly done. Ain't that so? What use one more corpse? Any more corpses? \nPutting the rest of the petitions on Hay's bed, he stands to leave. \nJOHN HAY Do you need company? \nINT.

Times like this, I'm best alone. \n", "test3_true": "Lincoln is seated at Eckert's desk, shawl wrapped around his shoulders, glasses on; he stares down into his hat, held between his knees. Homer Bates and Sam Beckwith are waiting for him. \nLincoln draws a handwritten note from his hat and carefully unfolds it. \nLINCOLN \"Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, City Point. I have read your words with interest.\" \nSam Beckwith transcribes Lincoln's words into code on a pad with a pencil. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) \"I ask that, regardless of any action I take in the matter of the visit of the Richmond commissioners, you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle, as you have done until now.\" \nHe stops for a moment. Beckwith waits, pencil poised. \nLincoln looks at the note, folds it, tucks it in a band inside his hat. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) \"Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.\" (ANOTHER PAUSE) \"A. Lincoln.\" And the date. \nSAMUEL BECKWITH (WHILE WRITING:) Yes sir. \nLincoln places the hat on the floor. \nSAMUEL BECKWITH (CONT'D) Shall I transmit, sir? \nLINCOLN (a beat, then:) You think we choose to be born? \nSAMUEL BECKWITH I don't suppose so. \nLINCOLN Are we fitted to the times we're born into? \nSAMUEL BECKWITH I don't know about myself. You may be, sir. Fitted. \nLINCOLN (TO HOMER:) What do you reckon? \nHOMER BATES I'm an engineer. I reckon there's machinery but no one's done the fitting. \nLINCOLN You're an engineer, you must know Euclid's axioms and common notions. \nHOMER BATES I must've in school, but... \nLINCOLN I never had much of schooling, but I read Euclid, in an old book I borrowed. Little enough ever found its way in here - (touching his cranium) - but once learnt it stayed learnt. \nEuclid's first common notion is this: \"Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.\" \nHomer doesn't get it; neither does Sam. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) That's a rule of mathematical reasoning. It's true because it works; has done and always will do. In his book, Euclid says this is \"self-evident.\" (A BEAT) D'you see? There it is, even in that two-thousand year old book of mechanical law: it is a self- evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. We begin with equality. That's the origin, isn't it? That balance, that's fairness, that's justice. \nHe looks at his scribbled note, then at Sam and Homer. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) Read me the last sentence of my telegram. \nSAMUEL BECKWITH \"Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.\" \nLINCOLN A slight emendation, Sam, if you would. \nBeckwith writes as Lincoln dictates. \nLINCOLN (CONT'D) \"Have Captain Saunders convey the gentlemen aboard the River Queen as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and there wait until...\" (BEAT) \"...further advice from me.

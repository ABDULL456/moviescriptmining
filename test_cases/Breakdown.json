{"train": "BREAKDOWN by \nJonathan Mostow \nMarch 1996 \nRevised First Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \nEXTREMELY TIGHT ON ELECTRONIC GUTS \nof a video camera. The screwdriver blade of a Swiss Army knife ENTERS FRAME, methodically tightening a row of screws. \nPULL BACK to reveal: \nEXT. BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY \nOn the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam. \nThroughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around him. \nHOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars. \nBeyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street, billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language. \nHOWARD How about it, Jeff? \nJeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed. \nJEFF Done. \nJeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard. \nEXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - DAY \nA frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an armload of books. \nEXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAY \nJeff focuses the minicam. \nMINICAM POV \nFRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman. \nHOWARD (O.S.) Nice legs. \nJeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street. In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal. \nEXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - DAY \nA row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel. \nEXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE \nJEFF (matter-of-fact) Sniper. \nHOWARD Where? \nJEFF High-rise. Top floor.        Window in the middle. \nHOWARD (looking through his binoculars) Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go back to the woman. Now! \nJeff swings the minicam and -- \nEXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - MINICAM POV \n-- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner. \nHOWARD (O.S.) Back to the sniper. \nEXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE \nHOWARD Stay tight on the sniper. Jesus -- look at him! He's about fourteen! Don't lose this! \nJeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder. \nEXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - POV THROUGH VIEWFINDER \nJeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position. \nJEFF He sees her. \nEXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE \nHOWARD Stay on her. If she runs, widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame. \nJeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at Howard. \nJEFF I said he sees her. \nHOWARD I heard you.    Stay on her. \nJeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing, oblivious. \nJeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again. \nSomething catches her attention from across the room. She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads over to a closed door. She knocks softly. \nAMY Can I come in? \nJEFF (O.S.) Sure. \nINT. DARKROOM - NIGHT \nA walk-in closet has been converted into a small photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are moody black and white landscapes. \nJeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He doesn't look up. \nAMY Couldn't sleep? \nJeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a landscape photograph in the developing tray. \nAMY I remember when you took that. We had fun on that trip, didn't we? \nJeff nods.    Amy looks at him.     After a beat: \nAMY You want to talk about it? \nJEFF There's nothing to talk about. \nAMY C'mon, Jeff. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story. \nAMY That's   it? \nJeff nods. \nAMY Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility. You can't keep beating yourself up over it. \nHe says nothing. \nAMY What do you think? You could have stopped that girl from getting killed? \nJEFF You don't understand... \nHe stops, lifts his eyes. \nJEFF It was different this time. \nHe breaks off and pushes through the curtain.    She watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT \nJeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her eyes. After a beat: \nJEFF I talked to Reynolds. (a beat) He thinks I could still get the job at the San Diego station. \nAMY Oh, Jeff, you didn't... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be? \nShe looks at him, concerned. \nAMY Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away? \nJEFF Who's running? It's good money, full benefits. I'm tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank. \nAMY You know I'll never stand in your way. But you've worked so hard. Are you sure you want to throw it away? \nJEFF Throw what away? Don't you get it? I don't do anything. I sit, I watch, I film -- I let it happen. \nAMY You're supposed to let it happen. It's your job. \nJEFF No, Amy.   It's my excuse. \nShe looks at him, not understanding.       He hesitates. \nJEFF That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed. \nHe looks at her, emotional. \nJEFF Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAmy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE - DAY AND NIGHT \nThe metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts Turnpike. \nTRUCKER Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the rest of your trip. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nAs Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up. \nEarl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat- stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over Jeff's shoulder. \nJeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him, unsmiling. \nEARL (flatly) Nice car. \nJeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back to the engine, decides to keep pouring. \nJEFF Thanks. \nEarl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in. Jeff watches him, wary. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEARL Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards. \nJEFF I guess. \nEARL Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio. \nJEFF Is that right? \nThe oil bottle empties    out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away and screws back on the    crankcase cap. He shuts the hood with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle    from the tank. Earl blocks his path. \nEARL 'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle. \nJeff says nothing.      This is not a friendly conversation. \nEARL How about Shit-for-Brains? (beat) You damn near killed us back there, boy. \nJEFF Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. \nEARL The hell I did. I saw what happened. \nLooking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini- mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully, anxious to avoid a confrontation. \nJEFF How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble. \nEARL (snorting) Yeah.     I bet you don't. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEarl glares at Jeff before turning away.    He passes Amy, gives her a broad smile. \nEARL Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee. \nAmy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff, puzzled. \nAMY What was that about? \nJEFF Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him. \nJeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the mini-mart. \nJEFF C'mon, let's go. \nAMY You want me to drive? \nJEFF Later.   Just get in. \nAMY Is something wrong? \nJEFF No, let's just go. \nJeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away. \nINT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAY \nAs Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the rear-view mirror, sees -- \nMIRROR POV \nEarl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the disappearing Jeep. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75, then 80, then 85. \nAMY This isn't the Grand Prix, you know. \nJeff releases his foot from the accelerator.     The needle sinks back down to 65. \nShe gives him a long contemplative look. \nAMY What's bothering you? \nJEFF I told you. Nothing. (pause) The guy was an asshole. \nJeff drives, a determined expression. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe Jeep blows past. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY \nA weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot.     A peeling sign on the roof: \"Belle's: Beer & Food.\" There is a phone booth outside. \nThe Cherokee pulls in and parks.      Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM, heads for the entrance. \nINT. BELLE'S - DAY \nDark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and watching a football game on a big MUTED TV. \nJeff enters and all conversation stops. The other patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to their beers. \nJeff glances around.   No sign of Amy.   No sign of Red. \nA bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter, preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu. Jeff approaches. \nJEFF Excuse me. \nThe Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand. \nJEFF I was supposed to meet my wife here. \nThe Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:    Yeah, so? \nJEFF Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt. \nBARTENDER A pale blue what? \nJEFF Benetton shirt. \nThe Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an order slip. \nBARTENDER Hank!  Your order's ready. (to Jeff) I been busy. They come and go. \nJEFF It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker? \nBARTENDER A trucker. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler. \nThe Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head. \nBARTENDER Don't ring a bell. \nJEFF You sure? \nThe Bartender leans over the counter, calls out: \nBARTENDER Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em? \nJeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no. \nA disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him. \nFLO Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy. \nA few of the regulars chuckle at this.     Jeff ignores them, turns back to the Bartender. \nJEFF Could she have left a message with another one of your employees? \nBARTENDER Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here. \nJeff scratches his head.    This doesn't make any sense. \nJEFF I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner? \nBARTENDER (chuckles) No siree. Definitely not. \nJeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around.      An elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him.      They whisper to each other. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (under his breath) Shit. \nHe turns and goes outside... \nEXT. BELLE'S - DAY \nJeff squints in the bright sunlight. \nMaybe he got this place confused with a different diner. He peers up at the sign. It says \"Belle's,\" all right. \nHe walks to the phone booth, looks inside.   The phone book is missing. \nHe picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone... Phone works okay. He hangs up. \n(NOTE: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks pass in either direction.) \nRED Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing? \nJEFF I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me? \nRED No. \nJeff reacts.    How thick can this guy be? \nJEFF Where's my wife? \nRED Huh? \nJEFF My wife.     Where is she? \nRed gives him a puzzled look. \nRED How should I know where your wife is? \nJEFF I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there. \nRED Mister, I don't know what you're talking about. \nJeff stares -- is this guy nuts? \nJEFF You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner. \nRed searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as possible. He shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED Nope.   Sorry. \nJEFF How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes! \nRed gives him a peculiar look. \nRED Mister, I never seen you before in my life. \nSuddenly, there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab -- the CB RADIO. \nCB VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you copy? \nJEFF (reacts) Your radio works -- (locks eyes with Red) What the hell are you doing -- ? \nJeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly: \nJEFF Amy?    Amy?!   You in there? \nRed shrinks back, unnerved. \nRED Look, mister, I don't know what you want, but -- \nJEFF I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?! \nRed's eyes dart to something in the distance.        Jeff catches this, turns... \nSHERIFF'S PATROL CAR \nCruising toward them. \nJeff runs into the middle of the road and waves frantically. The patrol car switches on its flash bar and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHERIFF BOYD, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation. Jeff runs over. \nJEFF Officer, I need your help! \nSHERIFF BOYD What's your problem? \nJEFF I don't know, this guy has my wife! \nSHERIFF BOYD Calm down, sir. Tell me what's going on. \nJeff catches his breath. \nJEFF I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her! \nRED Officer, he's crazy -- I don't know what he's talking about. \nJEFF Don't lie, you son of a bitch! \nThe Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster... just a precaution. \nSHERIFF BOYD All right -- everybody just calm down. (to Jeff) Sir, you want to tell me what happened? \nJEFF Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up. \nSHERIFF BOYD (turning to Red) Sir? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching the cab. Red watches calmly. \nSHERIFF BOYD Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you. \nJeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting his teeth. \nJEFF It was him.    It was this truck. \nSHERIFF BOYD Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate? \nJeff stares at him, knows where this is going. \nJEFF No. \nSHERIFF BOYD What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF I wasn't paying attention. \nThe Sheriff studies him a beat, nods. \nSHERIFF BOYD Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today? \nJEFF What does that have to do with anything? \nSHERIFF BOYD Well, for starters, maybe she left you. \nJEFF I don't believe this... \nSHERIFF BOYD I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa. \nJeff stares at the cop.    Emphatic: \nJEFF My wife did not leave me. \nRED (cuts in) Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay and help, but I really got to make it to Fresno... \nSHERIFF BOYD I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I appreciate your cooperation. \nJEFF This is insane. You're just going to let him go? \nSHERIFF BOYD I've got his information. If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED Much obliged. (to Jeff) Good luck findin' your wife, mister. No hard feelings. \nRed climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly, resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do.        The Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio.        As the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser. \nSHERIFF BOYD Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help. \nHe hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it. \nSHERIFF BOYD The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing. \nJeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in.    The Sheriff softens, his tone sympathetic. \nSHERIFF BOYD If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up. \nAs Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police RADIO SQUAWKS. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) (filtered) Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again. Can you respond? \nSHERIFF BOYD (into mike) 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way. \nHe racks the mike. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF I want your name and badge number. \nThe Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs. \nSHERIFF BOYD Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary -- \nJEFF Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 A.M. \nSHERIFF BOYD (exhaling) Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor. \nThe Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. Jeff is left standing on the side of the road, desert in all directions. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nA wall is covered with missing persons' notices. Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us. Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the notices. \nPULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces. It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN CARVER, a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken. \nDEPUTY CARVER Is this a recent picture? \nJeff glances over. Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet- sized photograph of Amy. \nBARTENDER What are you, nuts? I don't have to show you jack shit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff leans in his face. \nJEFF If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile. \nThe Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye: \nBARTENDER You calling me a liar? \nA tense beat. \nPossessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand clamps onto his. \nBARTENDER Mister, I've had just about enough of you. \nJEFF Let me see the fucking slips. \nIn one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts the receipts. He starts going through them, fast, looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and... \nJeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a Smith & Wesson revolver. \nBARTENDER Now, mister, you're going to have to leave. \nJeff takes a step back. Everyone in the diner is staring. He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit. \nEXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY \nJeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth. \nPHONE BOOTH \nis occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized frame, ill-fitting clothes. Jeff raps on the glass anxiously. \nJEFF Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed. His sluggish demeanor suggests mental retardation. He hangs up and slowly opens the door. \nSLUGGISH MAN (drawls) My name's Billy. You the feller lookin' for his wife? \nJEFF How'd you know? Did you see her? \nThe Sluggish Man hesitates. There's something holding him back. Jeff senses this. \nJEFF Please, if you know something, anything, tell me. \nBILLY (SLUGGISH MAN) (a beat) I seen her... maybe. \nJEFF What?    When? \nBilly is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked. \nBILLY Oh man. Never shoulda opened my damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it. \nBilly breaks into a loping run through the parking lot. Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy between two cars, trying to calm him. \nJEFF No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw. \nBilly glances around nervously, swallowing. \nBILLY She came in on a truck.   A big white one. \nJEFF Yes... \nBILLY Then she... she got in another truck. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF Another truck? With who? \nBILLY Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I see things. \nJeff reels, struggles to stay focused. \nJEFF Do you know where they went? \nBILLY Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the river. \nJEFF Where by the river? \nBILLY Dunno. They don't tell me that kind of stuff. \nJEFF Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck? \nBilly's expression darkens.     He starts backing away. \nBILLY I ain't talking to you no more. \nJEFF Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me. \nhas been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl. \nEarl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle.   He raises it to his shoulder. \nEARL (calling out) Out of the car! Put your hands where I can see 'em! \nJEFF \nswears, panicking. \nEARL I said get out, dammit!   Now! \nJeff stares into the rifle, deliberating.   His hand moves to the gearshift. \nHe jerks it into reverse and floors the gas! \nCHEROKEE \npeels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming for the chainlink fence. \nIt BURSTS the FENCE!   Poles and chain mesh go flying! \nJEFF \ncranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road. \nHe throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle. \nEARL \njumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit. \nJEFF \nGUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel- drive lever. \nDIRT ROAD \nThe huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain. \nJEFF \nGUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while -- \nRAM \nkeeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab, Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter. \nJEFF \nthrows the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as -- \nIDLED BULLDOZER \nblocks the road at a construction site. More unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond. \nJEFF \nbrakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up; on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine. \nHe cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and plunges into the ravine! \nCHEROKEE \nbounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING through sagebrush and manzanita. \nJEFF \nclings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases and packing boxes go everywhere. \nThe Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES through the upper branches of a willow grove. \nAs the leaves part, we see... a river. \nCHEROKEE \nlands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER. \nEARL \njerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river. \nEARL Sonofabitch... \nHe grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the slope. \nINSIDE CHEROKEE \nThe world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS. \nJeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking.   The river is flowing right through the Cherokee! \nLuggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke cans bob on the surface of the water. \nJeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side. \nHe gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the driver's side door and pushes it open. \nHe hoists himself through the door. \nRed turns back to Jeff. \nRED Like I said, Jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing I can do. Hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, I figure you're fixing on calling the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the 82nd Airborne. \nJeff stares back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED Problem is, you can see this town for miles around. So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here? They gonna fly in? Drive in? Either way, we'll see 'em. So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead. \nHe tosses Jeff the binoculars. \nRED Now take a look at the building with the flagpole. \nJeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars. \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS \nThe IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small building with a police cruiser out front and a barely legible sign: \"BRACKETT SHERIFF.\" It's the police station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form earlier. \nRED (O.S.) There's exactly two cops in this town. One of them's inside pulling ass duty; the other's on patrol in the foothills. Now a minute ago one of my men called in a non-injury accident on the I-40 connector. \nDeputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights flashing. \nRED (O.S.) It'll take that good ol' boy 20 minutes to get to the connector, another 10 to see there's no accident, and another 20 or so to tool his way back. 50 minutes all in. \nThe cruiser pulls away down the highway. \nJEFF \nlowers the binoculars and looks at Red. \nRED That's your deadline. If for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before I'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good. \nHe smiles at Jeff. \nRED See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we don't like something, we split. Period. (beat) Helluva lot safer than sticking up 7-11s, wouldn't you say? \nThey lock eyes.   Red tosses Jeff a Windbreaker. \nRED Put this on. You can't go into the bank like that. \nJeff puts on the jacket.    It covers his filthy shirt. Red checks his watch. \nRED How about it, Jeff? Time to get the show on the road? \nON Jeff's expression... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOTTOM OF MESA - DAY \nJeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends   the loose rock at the foot of the mesa. He looks up at    the ridge, but Red and his crew have pulled back out of   view. Jeff starts across an open field toward the town,   first jogging, then running. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nJeff hurries toward the bank. He looks back at the mesa again. The gang has disappeared. \nUp ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street. Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck pulls around a corner. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nJeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small town operation. A guard stands near the entrance. Several customers wait in line for the woman teller. \nJeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun. Jeff approaches. \nJEFF I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston. \nCALHOUN looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's appearance. \nCALHOUN Yes... sir. I'm the manager. Would you like to have a seat? \nJeff remains standing.    He eyes the other customers nervously. \nCALHOUN Sir? \nJEFF (turning; preoccupied) What? \nCALHOUN I said you can have a seat if you want. \nJEFF Right. \nHe takes a seat across the desk from the manager, reaches into his wallet and brings out several forms of identification. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take? \nCalhoun looks at him curiously. \nCALHOUN Are you all right? \nJEFF (quickly) Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card? \nCALHOUN Excuse me? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY \nJeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope. Various cars pass in either direction, but none slow down. \nJeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches. But the TRUCK THUNDERS past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his face. \nJeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow. \nThe Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him. It slows, then brakes to a halt. The passenger door opens. Earl sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol. \nEARL Toss the envelope on the seat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff stands firm. \nJEFF No.   First you tell me where she is. \nEARL Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money, then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway. \nJeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting him in view of passing traffic. \nJeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the      seat. Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several      packets of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands       and appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He       replaces them and gestures at Jeff with the gun. \nEARL Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around. \nJeff complies. Earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun. He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic. \nEARL Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck. \nJeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side door. Earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them with several layers of duct tape. \nEARL Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. Do it now! \nJeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed against the seat. \nEarl reaches over and pulls the door shut. He throws the truck in gear and starts driving. Jeff grimaces, looking up at him. \nJEFF I gave you the money.     Now let her go. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEARL 'Let her go.'    Do I look like I have her? \nJEFF What the hell -- \nEarl backhands Jeff against the passenger door. There is a RINGING sound and Earl pulls a CELL PHONE from his pocket. He presses a button and raises it to his face. \nEARL (on phone) It's done. I'm heading in. (a beat; listening) Gotcha. \nHe ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash. \nEARL You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble!' \nHe tucks the pistol in his belt.   Jeff looks at him, seething. \nJeff tries to squirm free. Earl sees it and belts him across the temple. Jeff slams into the passenger door, wincing. \nEARL I'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up. (mimicking panicked driver) Help, help, I ain't got no power! \nEarl laughs. Jeff has come to rest with his back against the door. By contorting his arms, he is able to draw the letter opener from his pocket. \nHe manipulates the letter opener into position and begins cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSteering with one hand, Earl reaches into the envelope, pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeff's face. Jeff saws faster at the duct tape. \nEARL You know what I'm gonna do first with your money, boy? Well, do you? \nJeff glares at him. \nEARL (fluttering bills under his nose) I'll give you a hint. Only one thing smells better than money. You wanta guess what? \nEarl laughs obscenely. He riffles the bills under his nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning. He looks down at the bills. \nEARL What the hell? \nEarl stares at the bills. Jeff works feverishly behind his back. Earl pulls out another packet, then another, examining the bills. \nEARL These are... it's nothing but singles... (erupting) You lyin' sonofabitch! \nThere is a RIPPING SOUND. Jeff wrests his hands free and lunges across the cab. He plants the letter opener in Earl's shoulder! \nEARL Aaagghh! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nThe pickup veers across the center line on the narrow mountain road. It swerves back, over-correcting wildly, and drifts for the opposite shoulder. \nINT. PICKUP - DAY \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY \nThe sheriff reacts. \nSHERIFF BOYD What the hell? \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nAs the Ram passes, Sheriff Boyd throws the cruiser into a SCREECHING 180-degree turn. He flicks on the SIREN and takes off in pursuit. \nINT. DODGE RAM - DAY \nJeff glances in the rearview mirror. The cruiser is on their tail, SIREN WAILING, lights flashing. He swears and pumps the brakes in a series of rapid bursts. \nJEFF End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me? \nEARL She's with Billy. \nJEFF Yeah?     Where's that? \nEARL I don't know!    Driving around! \nJeff hits the brakes again. \nINT. CRUISER - DAY \nSheriff Boyd jerks the wheel to avoid a collision with the pickup as it slows and accelerates in rapid spurts. \nSHERIFF BOYD (on radio) Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up! \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe cruiser pulls up alongside the pickup... \nINT. CRUISER - DAY \nBoyd reacts in amazement to what he sees -- \nSHERIFF BOYD Jesus Christ -- (on radio) Dispatch! Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor! \nBoyd taps his brakes, falling back behind the pickup. \nINT. PICKUP - DAY \nJeff is wild-eyed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF Where were you taking the money? \nEARL (losing it) To the truck stop... \nJEFF Where? \nEARL Main highway... Texaco... \nJeff has the information he needs.       He slams on the brakes! \nINT. CRUISER - DAY \nSheriff Boyd swerves to avoid a crash as the RAM SCREECHES to a halt in front of him! \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe cruiser skids to a stop. Jeff leaps from the pickup with the pistol in his hand. He rushes toward the cruiser. Sheriff Boyd hops out, levels his service revolver. \nJEFF I know where she is!   My wife! \nSHERIFF BOYD (ignoring him) Drop the gun! \nJeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an embankment. He raises his hands. \nJEFF You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped! \nSHERIFF BOYD I understand plenty. Now get down on the ground or I'll shoot! \nHe means it. \nINT. PICKUP - DAY \nEarl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his limbs. \nHe glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff ordering Jeff down on the ground. \nBy wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the duct tape from his knees. \nThe tape is still wrapped tightly around    his neck, pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws     at the tape, but it won't come free. Finally, with both     hands, he reaches behind his head and yanks the read rest    from the seat. \nHe reaches into his boot for something... \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nJeff is spread-eagled on the ground. Sheriff Boyd calls out to Earl in the cab. He keeps his gun leveled. \nSHERIFF BOYD You there -- in the pickup! You all right? Can you get out? \nEARL Yeah! Just don't shoot me, officer! He's crazy, I tell you! \nJeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of the truck stop. \nSwearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the opposite direction, shielding his face. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - DAY \nJeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast. \nHe scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering through binoculars. \nJeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building, passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead. \nRed is talking on a pay phone six feet away. \nJeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone. \nHe shields his face with the receiver and listens. \nRED (on phone) I don't know, dammit, he was supposed to be here a half hour ago. There's reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRed waits, listens. \nRED Look, I'm getting out of here. Stay off the airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn... You got that? \nHe hangs up.   Jeff presses the phone against his face and turns away. \nWhen he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to follow, then freezes. \nSeveral cops are fanning out on foot, questioning everyone they encounter. \nJeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out. \nJeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points toward the pay phones. \nJeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a rolling farm truck. \nCOP \nthanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow officers. \nJEFF \nruns alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer BLARES his HORN. \nJeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed. Jeff sprints in front of a moving car. \nThe driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away, avoiding being seen. \nRed's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on foot. They'll notice him any second. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly. \nJeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself... \n... in the path of another huge truck! \nA cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving wheels. He springs to his feet. \nRed's Peterbilt is pulling away! \nJeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump furiously. He runs abreast of the truck... \n... and seizes the spare tire mount! \nEXT. INTERSTATE - UNDER TRUCK - DAY \nJeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain. \nThe truck is joining the highway, accelerating. \nGrimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a HOWLING blur. \nSuddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab and holds firm. \nAs he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled expression on his face. \nJeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two. The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - DAY \nThe PETERBILT THUNDERS over a patch of highway that is being graded for paving. \nEXT. UNDER TRUCK - DAY \nThe tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt, pelting Jeff all over his body. \nHe realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with effort, he works his way hand over hand along the underside rigging toward the cab. \nHe seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up. \nEXT. BETWEEN CAB AND TRAILER - DAY \nCONTINUED: \nRED Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy? \nDeke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's hiding place. \nHe reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and unzips it. Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes against the windfoil. \nRED Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you. \nDeke runs up, breathless. Red holds two hands behind his back. Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff. \nRED Guess which hand. \nDEKE (pointing to right hand) This one. \nRed opens his right hand.    Empty. \nRED Nope.    Try again. \nDEKE (pointing to left) This hand. \nRed opens his left.    Empty. \nRED Nope. \nDEKE (he's been tricked) Dad... \nRED (laughing) Okay, okay, I'll give it to you. \nHe opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife. \nDEKE Cool! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDeke takes the knife and runs off. Red goes to the rear of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door. \nHe hops up inside. His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the metal trailer. We hear him SHIFTING BOXES. \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nJeff seizes his chance. He crawls out from under the windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave. \nThe STRUCTURE CREAKS under his weight. \nINSIDE TRAILER \nRed sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled. \nRED Deke?   Deke, you back there? \nEXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff crouches in the shadows. He can see Red poking his head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof. \nINSIDE TRAILER \nRed shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes, tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs the items into the barn. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff goes to a second-story window. A board has been nailed over the window. He pulls it away, steps into... \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT \nand looks around, amazed.     Everywhere around him there are stolen goods. \nMatching luggage sets... a rack of women's coats... a table piled with cameras... a crate filled with car phones... \nA stack of windshields... two sets of golf clubs... three child safety seats... a ten-speed bicycle... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSeveral dozen \"COMMERCIAL VEHICLE\" license plates are scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota... \nAs Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside. \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nRed looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at the barn. \nHe beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into... \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nAl dismounts from the moving truck. Billy climbs out of the Firebird. They are travel-sore, stretching. Red shuts the door behind them. \nAL Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon. \nRED Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl? \nBILLY (shakes head) There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it. \nRed grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes. \nBARN GROUND FLOOR \nThe men disappear with Amy into the cellar. We hear a METALLIC THUD, then a few moments later, the men reappear without her. Red closes the trap door, secures it with a heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring over it. \nRED C'mon, let's go. \nThey turn, walk toward the door. Red opens it. Arleen is standing there. Al and Billy greet her politely: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAL                             BILLY Howdy, Arleen.                     Hey, Missus C. \nARLEEN Well finally. Are you coming to breakfast? I've been calling you. \nRED Sure thing, honey. \nThe barn goes dark as the men leave.        The barn door rolls shut. A LOCK CLICKS. \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT \nJeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness. He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He swears, makes his way toward the... \nINT. REAR OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent whisper. \nJEFF Amy?   Amy, can you hear me? \nNo reply.     Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the floor. \nJEFF (louder) Amy? \nStill no reply. \nJeff swears, glances around the dark room.       There is a tool bench across the room. \nJEFF Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out. \nHe goes to   the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He knocks over   a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill across the   table. His hands run over an assortment of tools.  He   locates a hammer, takes it. \nReturning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe strains, using all his strength.     Suddenly the handle snaps! Jeff flies backwards. \nJEFF Fuck! \nHe gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the shackle, twisting with all his might. After several failed attempts, he swears. \nJEFF It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear. \nJeff mulls his options.    He sets his jaw, exhales. \nJEFF I'm going to get you out of there, Amy. \nHe swallows, emotional, clearly torn. \nJEFF I love you. (under his breath) Please, God, let her still be alive. \nINT. BARN - MOVING VAN CAB - NIGHT \nJeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio, but no luck -- the keys are gone. \nHe opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them quickly. \nJeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery. \nHe brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol. \nJeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The clip is full of bullets. \nHe snaps the clip back in place. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (under his breath) Fuck you, asshole. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nJeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging eave. He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground. \nHe looks around. Red's is the only house visible. A light flickers in the trees a mile away. It could be anything. \nJeff moves toward the house. \nEXT. RED'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT \nJeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen door. The DOOR CREAKS on its hinges. Jeff steps into... \nINT. RED'S HOUSE - REAR ENTRYWAY - NIGHT \nEXT. FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAWN \nJeff and Amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat terrain, illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAILER HOME - DAWN (MINUTES LATER) \nThe morning sky is lighter now. \nA rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked appliances and a clothesline. There's an old utility pickup truck parked in front. Jeff and Amy arrive out of breath. Jeff pounds on the door. \nJEFF Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home? \nThere's no answer. Jeff puts his shoulder to the door and rams it open. The flimsy door gives way easily. \nINT. TRAILER - DAWN \nJeff enters. The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about. A tattered flag hangs on the wall. There's no one around. \nJEFF (shouting) Hello? Anyone home? \nAmy follows him inside, looks around. Jeff crosses the room, snatches up a phone and dials 911. \nJEFF C'mon, c'mon... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWhile he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against the wall. She notices a set of car keys hanging by the door. \nJEFF (re: keys) Take it. We may need to get out of here -- (into phone, suddenly) Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name! \nAMY (suddenly hearing something) Jeff -- \nA DEEP RUMBLE is approaching, GETTING LOUDER by the second... \nJEFF No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in -- \nAmy pulls a curtain aside, reacts to what she sees -- \nAMY (panicked) Jeff! \nSuddenly, the ROAR is DEAFENING -- \nThe PETERBILT EXPLODES through the wall of the trailer home! \nJEFF AND AMY \ndive out of the way. \nINT. RED'S PETERBILT - DAY \nInside the truck cab, we catch a glimpse of Red behind the wheel, shouting something inaudible. Fragments of debris cling to the grille. \nINT. TRAILER HOME - DAY \nThe rickety structure spins 360 degrees! \nJeff goes flying. A TELEVISION somersaults across the room and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall. \nThe speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the trailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound! \nThe trailer home is suddenly open to the sky. \nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY \nRed puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another run at the devastated trailer. \nINT. TRAILER HOME - DAY \nJeff struggles to his knees. \nJEFF Amy?! \nAmy is crawling over the debris. Jeff pulls her to her feet. He grabs the rifle and car keys. \nJEFF C'mon! \nThey stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer. \nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY \nRed sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the utility pickup. He throws the Peterbilt into a turn. \nYARD \nAmy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder. \nIN FORD \nJeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side. \nAMY Jeff, go!    Go! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \na STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air! \nIN PETERBILT \nRed swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up ahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes. There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED Sonofabitch -- \nHe realizes:    The trailer's got no brakes. \nHIGHWAY \nThe Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID- FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down on the Ford. \nIN FORD \nAmy turns in the seat, terrified. The truck looms closer. Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor. \nJEFF Hang on! \nThey are flying into a hairy curve. \nIN PETERBILT \nRed struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward. \nThe Peterbilt races into the curve. \nRed has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether. \nHe hits the brakes! \nHIGHWAY \nThe huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking, cab and trailer folding at right angles! \nThen, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab! \nIN CADILLAC \nFlanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab. \nNow the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop. \nAl tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him. Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming! \nHIGHWAY \nThe trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap metal! \nAnd just as this is happening... \nPETERBILT \nblasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights! \nJEFF \nslams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the dashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the Peterbilt. \nHIGHWAY \nThe two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed as they hurtle down the grade. \nJEFF \njams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and FIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille. \nThe GUN CLICKS empty. \nIN PETERBILT \nRed hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding sideways. \nUp ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge. \nHIGHWAY \nThe Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come unlocked. \nThe FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH! \nThe PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away, SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the opposite railing! \nINSIDE ROAD \nJeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing has broken away. Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of the gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air. \nJeff looks at Amy.   She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes wide. \nJEFF You all right? \nAmy looks back at him.   She expels a long breath and nods. \nJeff forces his upper body through the driver's window and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt. \nSuddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes! \nThey grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw! \nThe steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice. \nRed gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering wheel continues to move counter-clockwise... \nON BRIDGE \nThe truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely. Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the Ford under its massive weight. \nIN PETERBILT \nRed has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up for a second, reacts, but it's too late. \nON BRIDGE \nThe Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the Ford, using the pickup like a ramp! \nIN FORD \nAmy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened under the Peterbilt's weight! \nON BRIDGE \nFor an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang in the air... then the truck is falling! \nIN PETERBILT \nRed and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first into the gorge. \nThen it jerks to a halt in mid-air! \nON BRIDGE \nThe left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete railing. \nThe Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge! \nIN PETERBILT \nJeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him. Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield. \nThey grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply, forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are inches apart. \nRED You think you can fuck with me?! \nHe headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from Jeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another blow when... \n... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below. \nJeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to the center support column. His legs dangle over the hood. \nRed slips through the opening, his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant. \nThe windshield sails away into the gorge. \nON BRIDGE \nThe iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly. \nON PETERBILT \nJeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield wiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away. \nRed is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff with his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach. \nJeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the corner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and seizes the handle. \nON BRIDGE \nThe REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford. As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the edge. \nON PETERBILT \nJeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge. \nREBAR \ngives away once more and -- \nJEFF \nscales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past the passenger door. \nBehind him, Red is working his way higher in the same manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the cab. \nJeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment. Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release button. \nThe passenger door flies open! \nRed falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the open passenger door, suspended over the gorge. \nIN FORD \nAmy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to the edge. She struggles to free her legs from the dashboard. \nAMY Oh God... Jeff... \n", "test1_input": "He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and hits \"send.\" The PHONE BEEPS. \nAMY Out of range? \nJeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap. \nAMY What's going on, Jeff? \nJEFF What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car. \nAMY Not the car. \nJEFF What? \nAMY What's going on with you? \nJeff busies himself with the engine, not answering. \nAMY It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this. \nJeff says nothing. \nAMY Jeff, I'm talking to you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (flaring) Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the -- \nHe stops in mid-sentence. There is a RUMBLE in the distance. They look down the road. \nJEFF Christ, not these guys... \nJEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP \napproaching fast on the road. As it streaks past, Earl yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. The BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt. \nBACK TO JEFF \nwatching the Ram speed away. \nJEFF Asshole... \nAMY (looking down the road) Jeff -- \nA quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits there, ENGINE IDLING. \nJEFF What the hell? \nAMY What's he doing? \nJEFF I don't know. \nJeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn and stare at -- \nMASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER \ncoming over a crest in the road. \nIt's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt. It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING. \nThe TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air. \nDOWN HIGHWAY \nthe PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and drives away, melting into the desert. \nAMY \nbreathes a sigh of relief. \nThe driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini- mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes immaculate. His name is Red. \nRED (TRUCKER) You folks all right? \nJEFF Yeah.   Our car broke down. \nRED (chuckling) I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it off the road? \nJEFF Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer? \nAmy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral. Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push, Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab. \nJEFF Think you could radio a tow truck for us? \nRED I sure would if I could, mister, but my C.B. blew a fuse this morning. I'm waiting till I hit the truck stop on I-40 to get it fixed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF How far is that? \nRED About 60 miles. \nJEFF (disappointed) Oh. \nRed walks around to the front of the car and peers down at the exposed engine. \n", "test1_true": "JEFF It's a new car. \nRED That could be the problem. You been running it pretty fast? \nAmy gives Jeff a reprimanding look.     It's subtle, but Red notices. \nRED Tell you what. If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. Belle's. They got a pay phone. You could call a tow truck from there. \nJeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram was last seen. \nJEFF Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along. \nAmy rolls her eyes. Red sees the look, trying not to smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED (casually) Suit    yourself. Not many cops on this    road, that's why the truckers use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky. (tipping his cap) Good    luck. \nHe turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot. \nAMY Are you nuts? \nJEFF We don't know this guy. \nAMY He's offering to help. It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along. It's 100 degrees.        You really want to be stuck out      here? \nJEFF Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here? (turns away, quietly to himself) Jesus... don't be stupid... \nAmy hears this.       She's had enough.   Flares. \nAMY Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride. \nIn the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP.       Then, mad and careless: \nAMY Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston. \nShe turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the truck down. Red brakes. \nAMY Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED (surprised) Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take you both just as easy. \nAMY That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse. \nShe goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse. Jeff follows, lowering his voice. \nJEFF What do you think you're doing? \nAMY I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff. \nJEFF (firm) You're not riding with that guy. End of story. \nAMY You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together? \nShe walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way. \nRED Watch your step, ma'am. \nShe pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and pulls away. Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers cease. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROADSIDE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER \nBeneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat from his face. He looks down the highway. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to the raised hood and studies the engine again. \nAfter a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious, he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns. \nJEFF'S POV - LOOSE WIRE \ndangling under the engine. \nBACK TO JEFF \nJEFF Oh for Christ's sake... \nHe pulls his Swiss Army knife  from his pocket and slides under the car. Working with   the screwdriver blade of the knife, he reconnects the plug  to its socket. In the process, his hands and shirt  become stained with grease. \nJeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The ENGINE ROARS to life. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - MINUTES LATER \nThe Cherokee speeds down the empty highway. \nINT. CHEROKEE - SAME TIME \n", "test1_id": 393, "test2_input": "EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER \nJeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river valley below. \nJEFF'S POV - RIVER \nThe men have given up their pursuit. \nThe moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around and backed up to the edge of the ravine. \nA stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the cargo door of the van. \nA cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the river. \nStanding knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels, then backwards out of the river. \nBACK TO JEFF \nwatching in amazement.   He can hear only snatches of their conversation. \nAL ... can't believe you let him get away... \nEARL You try chasing... through this shit... \nAL Fuck... this is what happens when you get one without the other... \nJeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled backwards up the slope toward the road. \nHe belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his feet and climbs higher. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF CLIFF - LATER \nJeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below. \nJEFF'S POV - ROAD \nThe Cherokee is now back on the road. \nOperating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the moving van. \nOnce the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close the van doors. \nBACK TO JEFF \nwatching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock. \nHe turns, reacts. \nIt's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull! \nJeff drops to the ground, unconscious. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CAR TRUNK - DAY \nThere is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside, dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in silhouette. He can hear their voices: \nEARL He coming around? \nBILLY Should be... I clocked him pretty good... \nA gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs. \nBILLY Rise and shine, dad. \nJeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't a halfwit anymore. \nBILLY C'mon, shake a leg. \nJeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all an act. \nJEFF (weak) Where is she? \nBILLY Give us some answers and you might find out. According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. Is that true? \nJEFF There's some... yeah... \nBILLY Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. Your wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (coming around; stalling) I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates... \nBILLY Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history. (turning) What do you think, Earl? \nEARL We been fucked with, is what I think. Little slut lied to us. Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive. \nBilly nods, disappointed. \nBILLY Yeah, I suppose. Too bad. (peers down at Jeff) Guess you're not the donut magnate after all. (to Earl) Waste of time. Plug him. \nEarl raises a pistol.   Jeff's eyes flash. \n", "test2_true": "Earl stops, glances at Billy.   They both eye Jeff carefully. \nBILLY Say again. \nJEFF (emphatic) Ninety thousand dollars. \nA faint smile plays on Billy's lips.     He slams the trunk. \nINT. CAR TRUNK - DAY \nIt's nearly pitch black. A beam of sunlight shines through a rusted hole. It illuminates Jeff's eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert. Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain. \nHe braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE NOISE is deafening. The car hits a depression and jounces wildly. Jeff is thrown about violently. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MESA OVERLOOK - DAY \nThere is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens. Jeff squints into the sun. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk. \nEARL Get out.   Don't try anything stupid. \nJeff gets out, grimacing.     His clothes are stained with grease and tire grime. He     sets his feet unsteadily on the ground, looks around.     We see that he has been confined in the trunk of a    Pontiac Firebird. \nThe Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars at the desert below. He glances at Jeff. \nRED You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey. \nJeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion. \nJEFF (barely able to control himself) What do you want? \nRED It's not me we're talking about. Question is what you want. \nJeff looks at him with loathing. \nRED See, I've got something you might want to buy. Can't show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you. About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff's anger bubbles over... \nJEFF You sonofabitch -- \nHe advances toward Red. Billy and Earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground. Billy drives a fist into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain. \nRed nods impassively. \nRED Bring him up here. \nEarl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to Red. \nFrom here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red gestures. \nRED Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall. (pointing) See that building? \nJeff follows his gaze. \nRED That's the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You with me? \nJeff nods tightly. \nRED Then here's the drill. You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet? \nJeff nods. \nRED You ask for the money in cash. Small bills. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED (CONT'D) Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you. \nJEFF How do I know she's still alive? \nBilly slugs him in the gut again.   Jeff doubles over. \nBILLY Shut up. \nRED She's tucked away someplace safe. You get her back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that. \nJeff compresses his lips. \nRED Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right? \nJeff says nothing. Red raises a hand-held CB to his mouth. He keys the transmitter. \nRED (into mike) Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate. \nAL (V.O.) (filtered) Copy that, Iron Man. \n", "test2_id": 394, "test3_input": "Red is out of his chair. Jeff dives first and seizes the rifle. He whirls, aims the pistol at Red. \nJEFF Don't fucking move! \nEveryone freezes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff sidesteps to the window. Billy is running across the yard. Is he headed for the barn? Jeff swears, turns back. \nJEFF Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet! \nDeke rises, tears streaming down his face. \nJEFF It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up. \nDeke obeys. Clutching his shoulder wound, Al glares at the child as he passes. \nJeff deliberates. Where the hell was Billy going?          He gnaws his lip, decides. \nJEFF Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody! \nRed, Arleen and Al get to their feet. Deke stays at his mother's side. Jeff aims the pistol at Red, holds the rifle with his other hand. \nJEFF Let's go.      Out. \nHe herds them to the door.      Arleen looks to Red nervously. \nRED Do like he says, Arleen.      He's crazy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nJeff trains the pistol as his captives stand at the entrance to the barn. He glances around, keeping an eye out for Billy. \nJEFF (to Red) Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife. \nRED This ain't gonna work, boy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (jams pistol at him) Do it. \nRed fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to Arleen. She just stands there. \nRED It's okay, Arleen.      Take it. \nShe takes the keys. \nJEFF (indicating barn door) Okay, now unlock it. \nArleen inserts a key, opens the padlock. \nJEFF Good.  Now give me the keys. (turning to Deke) Deke, push the door open. Quickly. \nDeke looks at his father. Red nods.         Deke goes to the door, begins wheeling it open. \nJEFF That's enough, Deke. (gesturing them inside with gun) Let's go. Move it. \nJeff herds all four into -- \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nJeff leads the group through the barn at gun-point. \nHe glances right and left, wired. The rifle is strapped to his back. He keeps the handgun ready. He peers under the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy. \nThey reach the trap door. Jeff circles it, constantly keeping an eye on Red and Al. He hands the keys to Deke. \nJEFF Deke, I need you to open this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDeke looks at his father. He kneels, unlocks the padlock and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow staircase slanting into the cellar. \nDeke looks down into the darkness and swallows. \nJEFF It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out. \nDeke descends the steps, frightened. \nDEKE (O.S.) (voice quavering) I can't see. \nJeff jabs the pistol at Red:    Tell him where the light is. \nRED (a beat, to Deke) The switch is on the right. \nThere's a CLICK and the light goes on in the cellar.

Uh-huh. \nJEFF Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her. \nThey wait tensely while Deke works downstairs. \nJEFF (to Red) You better pray she's all right. \nDEKE (O.S.) I got her -- \nAMY (O.S.) Jeff!!?? \nJEFF Amy!!! \nAMY (O.S.) I'm almost free!!! \nJEFF Amy, come up here! \nAmy climbs the stairs quickly. Scraps of duct tape cling to her wrists. She throws her arm around Jeff. \nAMY They were going to kill me. \nJEFF I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now. \nWhile Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the others.

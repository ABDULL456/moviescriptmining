{"test1_input": "EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER \nJeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river valley below. \nJEFF'S POV - RIVER \nThe men have given up their pursuit. \nThe moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around and backed up to the edge of the ravine. \nA stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the cargo door of the van. \nA cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the river. \nStanding knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels, then backwards out of the river. \nBACK TO JEFF \nwatching in amazement.   He can hear only snatches of their conversation. \nAL ... can't believe you let him get away... \nEARL You try chasing... through this shit... \nAL Fuck... this is what happens when you get one without the other... \nJeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled backwards up the slope toward the road. \nHe belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his feet and climbs higher. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF CLIFF - LATER \nJeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below. \nJEFF'S POV - ROAD \nThe Cherokee is now back on the road. \nOperating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the moving van. \nOnce the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close the van doors. \nBACK TO JEFF \nwatching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock. \nHe turns, reacts. \nIt's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull! \nJeff drops to the ground, unconscious. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CAR TRUNK - DAY \nThere is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside, dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in silhouette. He can hear their voices: \nEARL He coming around? \nBILLY Should be... I clocked him pretty good... \nA gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs. \nBILLY Rise and shine, dad. \nJeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't a halfwit anymore. \nBILLY C'mon, shake a leg. \nJeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all an act. \nJEFF (weak) Where is she? \nBILLY Give us some answers and you might find out. According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. Is that true? \nJEFF There's some... yeah... \nBILLY Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. Your wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (coming around; stalling) I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates... \nBILLY Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history. (turning) What do you think, Earl? \nEARL We been fucked with, is what I think. Little slut lied to us. Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive. \nBilly nods, disappointed. \nBILLY Yeah, I suppose. Too bad. (peers down at Jeff) Guess you're not the donut magnate after all. (to Earl) Waste of time. Plug him. \nEarl raises a pistol.   Jeff's eyes flash. \n", "test1_true": "Earl stops, glances at Billy.   They both eye Jeff carefully. \nBILLY Say again. \nJEFF (emphatic) Ninety thousand dollars. \nA faint smile plays on Billy's lips.     He slams the trunk. \nINT. CAR TRUNK - DAY \nIt's nearly pitch black. A beam of sunlight shines through a rusted hole. It illuminates Jeff's eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert. Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain. \nHe braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE NOISE is deafening. The car hits a depression and jounces wildly. Jeff is thrown about violently. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MESA OVERLOOK - DAY \nThere is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens. Jeff squints into the sun. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk. \nEARL Get out.   Don't try anything stupid. \nJeff gets out, grimacing.     His clothes are stained with grease and tire grime. He     sets his feet unsteadily on the ground, looks around.     We see that he has been confined in the trunk of a    Pontiac Firebird. \nThe Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars at the desert below. He glances at Jeff. \nRED You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey. \nJeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion. \nJEFF (barely able to control himself) What do you want? \nRED It's not me we're talking about. Question is what you want. \nJeff looks at him with loathing. \nRED See, I've got something you might want to buy. Can't show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you. About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJeff's anger bubbles over... \nJEFF You sonofabitch -- \nHe advances toward Red. Billy and Earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground. Billy drives a fist into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain. \nRed nods impassively. \nRED Bring him up here. \nEarl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to Red. \nFrom here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red gestures. \nRED Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall. (pointing) See that building? \nJeff follows his gaze. \nRED That's the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You with me? \nJeff nods tightly. \nRED Then here's the drill. You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet? \nJeff nods. \nRED You ask for the money in cash. Small bills. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED (CONT'D) Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you. \nJEFF How do I know she's still alive? \nBilly slugs him in the gut again.   Jeff doubles over. \nBILLY Shut up. \nRED She's tucked away someplace safe. You get her back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that. \nJeff compresses his lips. \nRED Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right? \nJeff says nothing. Red raises a hand-held CB to his mouth. He keys the transmitter. \nRED (into mike) Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate. \nAL (V.O.) (filtered) Copy that, Iron Man. \n", "test1_id": 393, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: \nRED Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy? \nDeke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's hiding place. \nHe reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and unzips it. Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes against the windfoil. \nRED Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you. \nDeke runs up, breathless. Red holds two hands behind his back. Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff. \nRED Guess which hand. \nDEKE (pointing to right hand) This one. \nRed opens his right hand.    Empty. \nRED Nope.    Try again. \nDEKE (pointing to left) This hand. \nRed opens his left.    Empty. \nRED Nope. \nDEKE (he's been tricked) Dad... \nRED (laughing) Okay, okay, I'll give it to you. \nHe opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife. \nDEKE Cool! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDeke takes the knife and runs off. Red goes to the rear of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door. \nHe hops up inside. His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the metal trailer. We hear him SHIFTING BOXES. \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nJeff seizes his chance. He crawls out from under the windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave. \nThe STRUCTURE CREAKS under his weight. \nINSIDE TRAILER \nRed sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled. \nRED Deke?   Deke, you back there? \nEXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff crouches in the shadows. He can see Red poking his head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof. \nINSIDE TRAILER \nRed shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes, tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs the items into the barn. \nEXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff goes to a second-story window. A board has been nailed over the window. He pulls it away, steps into... \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT \nand looks around, amazed.     Everywhere around him there are stolen goods. \nMatching luggage sets... a rack of women's coats... a table piled with cameras... a crate filled with car phones... \nA stack of windshields... two sets of golf clubs... three child safety seats... a ten-speed bicycle... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSeveral dozen \"COMMERCIAL VEHICLE\" license plates are scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota... \nAs Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside. \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nRed looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at the barn. \nHe beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into... \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nAl dismounts from the moving truck. Billy climbs out of the Firebird. They are travel-sore, stretching. Red shuts the door behind them. \nAL Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon. \nRED Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl? \nBILLY (shakes head) There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it. \nRed grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes. \n", "test2_true": "Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole. \nJEFF'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE \nThe men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage, photography equipment, miscellaneous items. Inside the moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible, partially covered with a tarp. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean. \nRED So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off. \nThere is a HAMMERING noise, O.S.    Red looks over, irritated. \nRED Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing? \nAl sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red. \nAL Figured I'd get started on the jewelry. \nRED Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us with the girl. \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT \nJeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the knothole. \nINT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT \nRed unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal box, similar to a drawer in a morgue. \nThey lift the metal lid, revealing -- \nCANVAS SACK \nThe sack is stained and ripped.    Red pokes at it.   The sack doesn't move. Red shrugs. \nRED Must've died from the exhaust. \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT \nJeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded.   Moisture forms in his eyes. \nINT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT \nBilly and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift out the sack. \nRED I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out. \nSuddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly. \nAL (startled) Aagh! \nAl falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her screams muffled. \nINT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT \nWe see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive. \nINT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT \nAl gets to his feet, furious. \nAL Goddamn.   Scared me half to death. \nBILLY (chuckles) Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be more careful next time. \nAL Shut up. (glaring at Amy) Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her head off right now. \nARLEEN (O.S.) (muffled) Warren? You in there? \nRed reacts. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRED Shit, it's my wife. Help me get her in the freezer. (calling out) Just a second, Arleen. \nRed walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a root cellar. \nAMY \nsquirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped, face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is visible in the knothole. \nTheir gaze meets... and holds... \nRED \nreturns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red peers into her terrified face. \nRED Don't   worry, honey. It's not as bad as   it sounds. It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out.    Probably won't even feel it. \nAmy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no match for the three men. \nBARN HAYLOFT \nJeff watches helplessly as... \n", "test2_id": 394, "test3_input": "BARN GROUND FLOOR \nThe men disappear with Amy into the cellar.

BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT \nJeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness. He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He swears, makes his way toward the... \nINT. REAR OF BARN - NIGHT \nJeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent whisper. \nJEFF Amy?   Amy, can you hear me? \nNo reply.     Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the floor. \nJEFF (louder) Amy? \nStill no reply. \nJeff swears, glances around the dark room.       There is a tool bench across the room. \nJEFF Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out. \nHe goes to   the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He knocks over   a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill across the   table. His hands run over an assortment of tools.  He   locates a hammer, takes it. \nReturning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe strains, using all his strength.     Suddenly the handle snaps! Jeff flies backwards. \nJEFF Fuck! \nHe gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the shackle, twisting with all his might. After several failed attempts, he swears. \nJEFF It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear. \nJeff mulls his options.    He sets his jaw, exhales. \nJEFF I'm going to get you out of there, Amy. \nHe swallows, emotional, clearly torn. \nJEFF I love you. (under his breath) Please, God, let her still be alive. \nINT. BARN - MOVING VAN CAB - NIGHT \nJeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio, but no luck -- the keys are gone. \nHe opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them quickly. \nJeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery. \nHe brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol. \nJeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The clip is full of bullets. \nHe snaps the clip back in place. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF (under his breath) Fuck you, asshole. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

There is    a rifle rack across the room. \nStepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall toward... \nINT. RED'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRed is in the middle of telling a story.

(gestures) Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from? \nArleen looks up at Jeff, scared.      She starts to open her mouth, when -- \nDEKE (O.S.) Stick 'em up. \nJeff turns. Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands. The boy's lip quivers. \nThe room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly: \nJEFF You don't want to do that, kid. Just put the gun down. \nRED (firm) Don't listen to him, Deke.        Keep the gun on him. \nJEFF Put the gun down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDEKE (voice quavering) My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time.

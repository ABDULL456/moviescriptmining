NATHAN I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. 
GABRIELLE Where do we look for little lost Puff? 
NATHAN I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. 
GABRIELLE That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? 
NATHAN You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes! 
Nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, scrunches his face and holds his ears. He relaxes a bit, and gets out of bed. He walks across the room, pulls on some pants, and picks up a container called "Stop Buggin' Me, Sunny." 
NATHAN I'm going alone. This could be dangerous. 
GABRIELLE (pulling covers up and turning away from him onto her side) Okay, my sweet. Good night. 
NATHAN A little resistance would be nice, damn it. 
GABRIELLE (without opening her eyes) Please let me go with you. 
NATHAN No. 
GABRIELLE Okay. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Nathan is driving along a wooded dirt road. He's in his immaculate safari suit. He looks tired. He stops the car, pulls out a gun, and gets out. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS 
Nathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods. We follow. 
NATHAN (yelling) Aha! 
He looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a red X. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT 
Nathan is in his underwear. He is ironing his safari suit as he talks on the phone. 
NATHAN No luck yet, my sweet. 
We see an unfolded map on the bed. There are red X's in almost all the state parks along the east coast. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - EVENING 
Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries. 
Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces. 
Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face. She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Lila smiles. 
LILA It was paradise. (beat, sadly) At least for a tiny little while. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun.

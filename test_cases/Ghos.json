{"test1_input": "Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN wails into the night. \nINT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT \nSam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless. Sam yells. \nSAM Don't stop! I'm not dead! \nMolly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry in long terrible sobs. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nA DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her. \nSam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it. \nA wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench. He begins talking. \nMAN So, what happened to you? \nSam is startled, amazed that the man can see him. \nSAM What? \nMAN You're new, huh? I can tell. \nSAM Are you talking to me? \nMAN Relax. It ain't like before, you know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax. \nSAM Who are you? \nMAN I'm waiting for my wife. She's in 4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it. \nThe man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified. \nMAN (continuing) Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. You could be here a long time. (leaning in close) I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't as bad as you think. Zip zap. They ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. You'll catch on. \nSuddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing. \nMAN (continuing) He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it a million times. He's a goner. See? Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could have been the other ones. You never know. \nANGLE \nBefore Sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks up and freezes. \nThe amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table. They are emitting a powerful light. \nDOCTOR Hurry, we're losing him. \nMAN What'd I tell you? Bingo! \nThe glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly from a solid object into an ethereal substance. \nSam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit upward. They evaporate through the ceiling. \nDOCTOR He's gone. \nANGLE \nThe light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam turns to the Old Man. \nSAM Who are you? What's happening...? \nThe Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam jumps in front of him. \nSAM (continuing) No! \nCUT TO: \nSAM'S P.O.V. \nas the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of ultimate chaos, the universe within. \nThen, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling. \nSAM Oh God, help me. \nCUT TO: \nSAM'S P.O.V. \nas the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nSlowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral. \n", "test1_true": "We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave. \nMINISTER As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit... \nThe CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are among the mourners. \nMINISTER (continuing) All that we treasure, our friends, our loved ones, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us. We must surrender them all. We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end. \nSam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there. \nAs he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears just like any normal person until she approaches a large gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked. \nMINISTER As our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness. \nSuddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA STOPS. \nSAM Molly. \nShe does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her. Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand. He squeezes it with affection. \nMINISTER ...and into Your hands we commend his spirit. May he rest in peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. \nThe casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders. \nDISSOLVE: \nLONG SHOT - PEOPLE \nleaving the cemetery. We hear them talking. \nVOICES What time you going back to work?... What's the buzz on Digital? It's sad. He was so young... How's your new Honda?... Going away this weekend? \nCUT BACK TO: \nCLOSEUP - SAM \ndesperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine. He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then, after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body, from his own grave site, he runs after her. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. LOFT - DAY \nMolly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam, standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity he is lost and alone. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nANGLE \nRaw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his chest, rocking aimlessly. \nMolly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes. \nFrank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to the air. \nMOLLY Oh God, Sam... \nSam looks up. \nMOLLY (continuing) I picked up your shirts this morning. I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said to tell you hello. I broke into tears. It's so hard... \nSam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back. \nMOLLY (continuing) I think about you every minute. It's like you're still here, like I can feel you, Sam. \nHe stares at her, hoping, wondering. \nSAM I am here, Moll. I am. \nANGLE \nSuddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. Molly stands up. \nMOLLY Frank, what's wrong? Frank? \nThe cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes. Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she senses his presence. \nMOLLY (continuing; whispering) Sam? \nShe holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly, loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy, Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains IN THE FRAME, alone. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nSam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot, are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches for a shirt. \nSAM Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my favorite... \nShe tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. Sam recognizes it. \n", "test1_id": 600, "test2_input": "SAM Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line. \nOda Mae nods and starts to sign \"Oda Mae\". Sam stops her. \nSAM (continuing) No, no, no. Rita Miller. \nODA MAE (to the officer) Can I have another one please? I signed the wrong name. \nSam hits his forehead with his hand. The Officer gives her another card. Oda Mae signs it. \nSAM Tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make. \nODA MAE I need you to put that in the third floor file cause I got a transfusion to make. \nOFFICER A what? \nODA MAE You know what I mean. (innocently) Umm, can I keep the pen? \nOFFICER (surprised, not sure what to say) ...uh, sure. \nOda Mae, delighted, walks away smiling and gives the officer a wave. She is loving this. \nODA MAE Thanks. \nINT. CARL'S OFFICE \nThe clock on Carl's wall says 3:40. He seems anxious. The phone RINGS. Carl jumps. He pushes down the speaker button. \nCARL Hello. Carl Bruner speaking. \nVOICE Carl? \nCARL Mr. Balsitrari \nVOICE Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John. I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio. \nCARL Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll pick it up later. \nHe hangs up. His hand is shaking. \nINT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nSam and Oda Mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing administrative personnel. They approach a GUARD who is standing there. \nSAM Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Furgeson. \nODA MAE Lyle Furgeson, please. \nGUARD Do you have an appointment? \nODA MAE No. I'm here for the fun of it. \nSAM Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's here. \nODA MAE Tell him Rita Miller's here. \nGUARD Just one moment, please. \nSAM Don't embellish. \nODA MAE Yes, Sir. \nGUARD (turning around) Excuse me? \nShe waves him on. \nSAM (whispering) Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk. \nODA MAE Why are you whispering? \nSAM (he doesn't know) Just be quiet and listen. I've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul. \nWe see the Guard leaning over Mr. Furgeson's desk. FURGESON looks up and sees Oda Mae. He shrugs his shoulders. \nSAM (continuing) He's a social moron. You don't have to worry about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. \nThe Guard comes back. \nGUARD What is this regarding? \nODA MAE What? He doesn't remember me? We were together at the Brewster's Christmas party. With his wife Shirley. They had that lovely tree... all those presents. Why, I'll never forget all those beautiful... \nSam pokes her. She yelps, surprised, and glances around. The Guard gives her an odd look. \nODA MAE (continuing) Oops. Gas. \nShe forces a smile. He smiles back and then goes over to Mr. Furgeson. \n", "test2_true": "The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear. Furgeson appears totally flummoxed. He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves. The Guard motions her to come back. She walks proudly over to his desk. He sticks out his hand. \nFURGESON Hello, hello. Of course, of course. It's been so long. \nODA MAE A long time. \nSAM Ask how Bobby and Snooky are. \nODA MAE How are Bobby and Snooky doin'? \nFURGESON (perplexed) Why, they're just fine, thank you. Nice of you to ask. And how is your... family? \nODA MAE Couldn't be better. \nFURGESON Well, isn't that wonderful. \nSAM Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities. \nODA MAE So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities? \nFURGESON (surprised) The Gibraltar securities! Well, it looks like we topped out, huh? \nSAM \"We sure did!\" \nODA MAE We sure did. \nFURGESON (impressed) That was a wonderful tip. \nSAM \"Good old Randy\". \nODA MAE Good old Randy. Got a real head on his shoulders. \nSAM \"Her\" shoulders. \nODA MAE \"Her\" shoulders. \nFURGESON Sure does. Well... well. So what brings you here today? \nSAM You're closing an account. \nODA MAE I'm closing an account. \nFURGESON Well... wonderful. Do you have your account number? \nSAM \nODA MAE \nSAM \nShe looks up into the air. Furgeson eyes her strangely. \nODA MAE Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm dyslexic. \nHe punches Rita Miller's number into the computer. A figure appears on the screen. He stares at it for a few seconds and then punches it in again. \nFURGESON (trying to be calm) Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing four million dollars from us today, is that correct? \nODA MAE Four million dollars?! \nSAM Say \"yes\"! \nODA MAE (gasping) Yes! Four million. That's right. That's right. \nFURGESON And how will you want that? \nODA MAE Tens and twenties? \nFURGESON Pardon? \nSAM A cashier's check! Tell him a cashier's check. \nODA MAE A cashier's check. \nFURGESON Fine. Of course, you realize we're required to get some identification from everyone. It's just procedural. You understand. \nODA MAE Of course. \nOda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles. \nODA MAE You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long. \nThe Officer nods appreciatively. \nINT. CARD FILE ROOM - DAY \nFurgeson lays Oda Mae's ID next to her signature card. The signatures match up. He nods his head in approval. \n", "test2_id": 601, "test3_input": "INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY \nCarl looks up at the clock. It is 3:50. He pushes down a button on the phone. A SECRETARY answers. \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Yes, Mr. Bruner. \nCARL Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. It's on the rolodex. \nINT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nMr. Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a cashier's check for $4,000,000. Oda Mae's hand shakes as she examines it. \nFURGESON I'll just need your signature right here. \nODA MAE Sure. \nSAM Sign Rita Miller. \nSam looks up and gulps. Molly has just entered the bank and is heading toward them. He jumps up nervously. \nSAM (continuing) I'll be back in a minute. You're on your own. Don't say anything foolish. \nOda Mae signs a form closing the account. Of course the signatures match. Mr. Furgeson examines them both and smiles. He shakes Oda Mae's hand. \nFURGESON Now you be careful with this. It's like carrying cash, you know. \nODA MAE (positively glowing) I sure do. \nSam rushes over to Molly. He is not sure what to do. He notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused, thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam, delighted, flicks another stack. \nOda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her. \nODA MAE (continuing) Then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps. Every gas station has 'em you know, sometimes six or more. It adds up. \nSAM Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out of here. Say goodbye. \nODA MAE (abruptly getting up) Well, I've got to leave. It's been a pleasure doin' business with you. Say \"hi\" to Shirley and Snooky for me. \nFURGESON Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to. \nOda Mae smiles and leaves. There is a new lilt in her walk. Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up. \nSAM Hurry up, Oda Mae. \nAt that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground. She stoops down and picks it up. \nODA MAE (excitedly) What a day! \nMolly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after her. Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment and then looks back across to the executive area. She sees Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him. \nMOLLY Lionel? \nHe is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous. \nFURGESON Molly. How are you? \nMOLLY Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady, about my height, did you see her? \nFURGESON Well, yes. I just took care of her. \nMOLLY What did she want? Did it have anything to do with me? Did she ask about Sam? \nFURGESON (not understanding) Sam? No. Why? \nMOLLY Was her name Oda Mae Brown? \nFURGESON No, Rita Miller. She just closed an account. \nMolly stares at Furgeson. She is not sure what to think. \nFURGESON (continuing) Is there a problem? \nMOLLY (hesitating, not sure what to say) No. I guess not. Thanks. \nShe walks away, confused. \nINT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY \nCarl, in front of his computer, is going crazy. He keeps punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears over and over on the screen. \"RITA MILLER, #926-31043. ACCOUNT CLOSED. BALANCE $00.00.\" \nPanicked, Carl jumps up. He moves quickly, erratically around the office and then back to the computer. He punches the keys over and over. The same answer appears on the screen. The account is closed. \nHALL OUTSIDE CARL'S OFFICE \nCarl runs through the office. He seems crazed. People look at him. \nLEEDEN Carl, is something wrong? \n", "test3_true": "LEEDEN What? \nCARL Is this a joke? One of my accounts is closed. \nLEEDEN Which account? What's wrong? \nCarl freezes. He doesn't answer. \nLEEDEN (continuing) You want me to call someone? \nCARL (changing his demeanor) No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's all right. I can do it. \nEXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nSam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself. \nODA MAE $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty. \nSAM Oda Mae. Take the check out of your purse. \nShe stops. There is a nervous look on her face. \nODA MAE Take it out? Why? \nSAM Just do it. \nOda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly. \nSAM (continuing) Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller. \nODA MAE (in shock) Endorse it? Why? \nSAM Do what I say. \nODA MAE No! \nSAM That's blood money, Oda. I was killed for that money. Endorse it now. \nODA MAE What are you going to do with it? \nSAM We're giving it away. \nODA MAE Away? What do you mean? To who? \nSAM Look to your left. \nOda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless. She recoils. \nODA MAE Are you outta your mind? \nSAM Do what I tell you. \nODA MAE No! (clutching the check) I can't. \nSAM Yes, you can. If you don't do it, they'll track you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now. \nODA MAE Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam. \nSAM I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go to heaven for this. \nOda Mae growls at him. \nWith great difficulty, she approaches the nuns. \nThe nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion. \nSAM Write \"St. Joseph's Shelter\". \nWith great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert their eyes from the check. \nNUN Bless you, child. \nOda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over. \nSAM I'm proud of you. \nODA MAE Don't you talk to me. I don't want you comin' round no more. I mean it. Understand? \nSAM Come on, we're friends. \nODA MAE Friends? Friends? \nShe turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after her. \nSAM I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae. \nShe growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an attempt to revive her. \n", "test3_id": 602}

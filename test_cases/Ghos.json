{"train": "\"GHOST\" \nScreenplay by \nBruce Joel Rubin \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. TRIBECA LOFT - DAY \nThe CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions. \nBroken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light. We see hints of a huge demolished space. \nAn old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance. \nWith startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere. The wall shudders. \nHAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. The wall buckles. \nChunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. We hear voices talking. \nMOLLY (O.S.) What a mess! \nSAM (O.S.) I told you! \nThrough jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS. \nSAM I can't breathe. \nMOLLY Use your mask, dummy. \nOne of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air. \nSAM (singing) \"Volga boat..., man.\" Whoomph! \nHis hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs. \nANGLE \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE \nBLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished. \nMOLLY Sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there. \nSAM And about eighty years of dust. \nMOLLY We have all this height, Sam. We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this space. \nSAM (eyeing her curiously) For what? \nMOLLY For space. Just space. \nSAM Be great for bumper cars. \nCarl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures. \nCARL Sam, this may be none of my business, but I'm concerned you're doing too much coke. \nSam glances down at his white body. They all laugh. \nMOLLY Hey, Sam, turn around. \nSam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic. \nCARL (offering his body) How 'bout me? \nMolly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a Greek statue. \nCARL I'll never wash again. \nMolly laughs. \nANGLE \nSam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly begins to count. \nMOLLY All together now. One, (they strike the wall with their hammers. The wall shakes) two, (they pound again. The wall begins to give) three. \nIn unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. Something rattles inside it, a penny. \nSAM Hey, look what I found. There's a penny inside. (he hands it to Molly) For luck in our new loft. It's a good omen. \nSAM Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by noon. Can you transfer it to his payroll account? \nCARL Sure. Just let me have your MAC code. \nSam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book. He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to Carl. \nSAM Discretion, huh? \nCARL You bet. I'll do it right away. \nINT. WELL-APPOINTED EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY \nSam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are sitting around a large granite conference table. Sam stands up and speaks a simple greeting to them. \nSAM (in Japanese) Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf of Market Security Bank & Trust, I welcome you to our city. \nThe men smile happily and nod their heads in unison. \nMEN Arigato. \nThey look to Sam, expecting more. Uncomfortable, he clears his throat. \nSAM I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York. (his throat goes dry and he takes a sip of water) But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace. \nA SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper. It reads \"MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT.\" She hands him a phone. \nSam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests. \nSAM Excuse me. (he picks up the receiver) Hello? \nCUT TO: \nMOLLY \ndressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into the phone. \nMOLLY A man and a woman are lying in bed when the woman's husband suddenly comes home. Frightened, she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window. He has no time to dress. \nCUT BACK TO: \nSAM \nstraight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is important. \nSAM Uh hmm. \nMOLLY (V.O.) It's raining outside. The man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching. \nThe entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam. \nMOLLY (V.O.) (continuing) One of the joggers calls out. \"Hey, do you always go jogging naked?\" And the man says, \"Yes, always.\" \nSAM Okay. \nMOLLY (V.O.) And then the other jogger says, \"And do you always wear a condom?\" The man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, \"Only when it's raining.\" \nSam squelches a smile. \nSAM Well, that's just fine. \nMOLLY (V.O.) Now just relax and have fun, okay? It's not the end of the world if you lose this account. You've always got me. \nSAM Thank you. I'll remember that. \nMOLLY (V.O.) See ya. \nHe hangs up and stares at the Japanese men. A short smile crosses his face. \nCUT TO: \nA CARVED WOODEN ANGEL \neight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street. \nA group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME. \nMOLLY Where you guys from, the New York City Ballet? \nWith a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and tries to grab hold of the ropes. She can't reach them. Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. She screams. \nSAM Saved your life. \nSam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. She does not think it is funny. \nMOLLY You bastard. Don't do that to me. You scared me half to death. \nSAM Better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. Here, look out. \nINT. MOLLY'S STUDIO - NIGHT \nMolly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is sitting at her potters wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters the studio. He is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans. \nSAM What are you doing? \nMOLLY I felt inspired. \nSAM At 2:00 am? \nShe nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in front of her. Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured, gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly, almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins kissing them. \nSAM (continuing) You notice Carl's eyes today? They were all over you. \nMOLLY What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me tell you something. He's not even looking at me. It's you he idolizes. He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, he's not my type. \nSam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay. Molly looks up at him. \nMOLLY (continuing) What are you doing? \nSAM I feel inspired. \nHis hands dig into the clay. Molly smiles. Their fingers seem to dance together. After a moment, she reaches up to him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving down to his chest. Sam grins and reaches down to her. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nSAM'S FINGER \nas it presses two buttons on his jukebox. We watch as the mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers it to the turntable. The arm hovers over the record and then descends. It begins to play. The song is \"Unchained Melody\" by the Righteous Brothers. \nSAM AND MOLLY \nare dancing in the middle of the dark loft. Moonlight pours through the windows and shines off the floor. Wads of packing paper swirl sensuously around their feet. \nMolly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her eyes, her lips. \nSam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance silently, her hair swaying in the soft light. \nWe hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor. \nSensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans. \nSam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing. Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands move to her backside. He pulls her closer. \nDISSOLVE: \nLIVINGROOM - NIGHT \nSAM AND MOLLY, making love on the livingroom carpet. Paper and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across the floor. For all their sensuality, it is their hands and eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that is deeply moving. Their lovemaking is full of love. \nJUKEBOX \nThe song ends. The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides the record back into its slot. \nDISSOLVE: \nOMITTED \nBEDROOM - NIGHT \nSam and Molly are lying together silently. Molly gazes at him. \nMOLLY What's the matter? \nSAM The matter? \nMOLLY I can tell. \nSAM Nothing... really. \nMOLLY You're worried, aren't you? About moving in together? \nSAM No. Not really. \nMOLLY Then what? The promotion? \nSAM I don't know. A lot of things. I just don't want the bubble to burst... Whenever something good happens to me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it. \nMolly gently strokes his head. \nMOLLY You know what? \nSAM What? \nMOLLY I love you. I really love you. \nHe smiles and strokes her cheek. \nSAM Molly, the \"New York Times\" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. Who cares what The New York Times thinks? \nMOLLY Eight million readers, that's who. \nSAM Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks. \nWe can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does. Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then, suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected seriousness in her voice. \nMOLLY (continuing) I want to marry you, Sam. \nSAM (taken aback) What? \nMOLLY I've been thinking about it for days. More than thinking. I want to do it. I want to jump in whole hog... (she pauses) What is that look for? \nSAM (staring at her) It's just been so long since... I mean, you never wanted to talk about it. \nThere is a long pause. \nMOLLY Do you love me, Sam? \nSAM What do you think, Moll? \nMOLLY How come you never say it? \nSAM What are you talking about? \nMOLLY You say \"ditto\". It's not the same. \nSAM People say \"I love you\" all the time. It doesn't mean anything. \nMOLLY Sometimes you need to hear it. \nSam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around. \nAN INTENSE LOOKING MAN \nis standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk. Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath. \nSam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them. \nMOLLY What should we do? \nSAM Let me handle this. \nSam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in the face. Molly screams. \nWILLIE Your wallet! \nSam waits a beat. \nMOLLY Give it to him! \nSam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and then carefully pulls the wallet out himself. \nSAM Take the money. Just leave the wallet and my... \nHe swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the mugger with all his might. \nMOLLY Sam, No! \nThere is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man. Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off running. Sam charges after him. \nMOLLY Sam!!!!! \nThe two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows. \nSam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward Molly. \nWe can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls out. \nSAM Molly! \nShe doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An expression of pure terror overwhelms his face. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSEUP - MOLLY \ndrenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock. Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows and pulls it toward her. \nIt is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms. \nSam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes. \nSuddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream. \nSAM No!!!!!! \nSwirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN wails into the night. \nINT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT \nSam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless. Sam yells. \nSAM Don't stop! I'm not dead! \nMolly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry in long terrible sobs. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nA DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her. \nSam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it. \nA wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench. He begins talking. \nMAN So, what happened to you? \nSam is startled, amazed that the man can see him. \nSAM What? \nMAN You're new, huh? I can tell. \nSAM Are you talking to me? \nMAN Relax. It ain't like before, you know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax. \nSAM Who are you? \nMAN I'm waiting for my wife. She's in 4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it. \nThe man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified. \nMAN (continuing) Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. You could be here a long time. (leaning in close) I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't as bad as you think. Zip zap. They ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. You'll catch on. \nSuddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing. \nMAN (continuing) He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it a million times. He's a goner. See? Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could have been the other ones. You never know. \nANGLE \nBefore Sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks up and freezes. \nThe amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table. They are emitting a powerful light. \nDOCTOR Hurry, we're losing him. \nMAN What'd I tell you? Bingo! \nThe glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly from a solid object into an ethereal substance. \nSam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit upward. They evaporate through the ceiling. \nDOCTOR He's gone. \nANGLE \nThe light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam turns to the Old Man. \nSAM Who are you? What's happening...? \nThe Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam jumps in front of him. \nSAM (continuing) No! \nCUT TO: \nSAM'S P.O.V. \nas the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of ultimate chaos, the universe within. \nThen, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling. \nSAM Oh God, help me. \nCUT TO: \nSAM'S P.O.V. \nas the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nSlowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral. \nMolly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek. After a moment she puts it back. Then, in a surprising outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. Everything comes flying off. Sam reaches out to console her. \nSAM (continuing) Molly, don't. \nUnexpectedly, Carl comes rushing into the room. He takes hold of Molly and sits her on the bed. \nSAM (continuing) Say something. Help her, Carl. \nCARL It's hard. It's very hard. \nSAM (sarcastic) Oh good. That's really good. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nMolly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops to pick it up but Molly gets it first. \nMOLLY Sam's address book. \nShe skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box labeled \"Sam's Things -- Valuable\" and continues packing. She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked \"For Luck\". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it on the nightstand beside the bed. \nCarl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's jackets. He examines them. \nCARL Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I toss 'em? \nMOLLY No! \nSAM Molly, we hated that concert. \nShe takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box. Sam groans. \nCarl finds a half used package of Rolaids. Molly takes them from his hand and puts them in the box, too. \nCARL Oh, you want to save those? \nSAM Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll? \nMolly just stares for a moment. \nMOLLY I miss him, Carl. \nCarl comes over and takes her hand. \nCARL We all do. \nMolly buries her head on his shoulder. Carl strokes her hair. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE \nCarl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door. Suddenly Molly yells out. \nMOLLY Wait. Wait. Not that one. \nShe hurries over and pulls the \"Valuable\" box from the stack in his arms. He looks at it with surprise. \nCARL Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know how that got in there. \nHe turns to the door and then back to Molly. \nCARL (continuing) Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's like summer outside. \nMOLLY No. \nCARL Just for a stroll. It'd be good to get out. \nMolly shakes her head and turns away. \nMOLLY I can't do it Carl. \nCarl, annoyed, walks over to her. \nCARL Molly... you're not the one who died! \nMolly stops and looks at him. He has struck home. After a moment she nods her head. \nMOLLY Okay. Just a short walk. \nHe gently squeezes her shoulders. \nCARL Thata girl. \nBefore Sam even understands what is happening, they are exiting the loft. Sam jumps up and runs after them. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nThe Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his eye. \nSam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their arms cutting through his ghostly form. \nSam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people approach him from all angles. \nWe hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let go. \nA barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close to the Mugger. \nEXT. NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION - DAY \nThe Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the IRT. \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY \nThe Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a corner of the train watching him. \nSuddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is happening, but then it is too late. \nANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST \nWith unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head plows right through it. \nANGLE \non Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling down on him. \nANGLE \non Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching. \nSam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane look. \nGHOST Stay off! This is mine! \nANGLE FAVORING WINDOW \nWith shocking impact, the Ghost's fist goes flying into the window. To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS. The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover. Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion. Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel into broad daylight. \nEXT. ELEVATED SUBWAY STATION - DAY \nThe train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn. \nOMITTED \nSAM'S P.O.V. \nSam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes after him. \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY \nSam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the street. \nEXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY \nThe Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of heavy machinery onto the pavement. \nSam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and notices a sign, \"SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, ADVISOR.\" He looks up to a third story window and sees a similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes after him. \nEXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY \nSam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 Prospect Place. \nINT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY \nSam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail. \nINT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade. \nWillie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. Nothing happens. \nSAM Damn! \nWillie dials the phone. Someone comes on the line. \nWILLIE She came home. I couldn't get it. Give me a couple of days. I'll go back. \nHe hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion. \nSAM Get what? Who the hell are you? What were you doing at Molly's? What the hell's going on? \nWillie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies down. After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo from the drawer. He studies it slowly. \nODA MAE (V.O.) I got a message from Sam. \nMOLLY (stunned) What? \nODA MAE (V.O.) Sam Wheat. He asked me to call. \nMolly slams down the receiver, panting. For several seconds she doesn't move. Slowly, she walks to the couch and sits down. She is trembling. \nINT. ODA MAE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nOda Mae hangs up the phone. \nODA MAE What'd I tell you. \nSAM You gotta go there. \nODA MAE Look, I don't care what you do to me, I'm not goin' nowhere. \nINT. ODA MAE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSam is sitting on the edge of Oda Mae's bed, singing. It sounds like he's been singing for hours. He is very hoarse. \nSAM \"I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin' married to the widow next door / She's been married seven times before / And every one was an Henery / Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery the Eighth I am / Second verse same as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth I am...\" \nOda Mae bolts upright in her bed, her hands over her ears. \nODA MAE Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut your mouth. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY \nINT. BUS - DAY \nSam and Oda Mae are sitting at the rear of a crowded bus. She appears to be talking to herself. \nODA MAE I can't believe I'm doin' this. I gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the city with you. I never go there. What the hell you doin' in my life, huh? Why me? \nSeveral people move away. \nOMITTED \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY \nOda Mae approaches the loft building and buzzes Molly's apartment. She waits a few moments. \nODA MAE There's nobody there. \nSAM Just wait. \nODA MAE No, sir. I did what I promised. I said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't say anything 'bout waitin'. \nSAM Just one more time. Please. It's a big place. \nOda Mae turns to leave. Sam, desperate, starts to sing. \nSAM (continuing) \"Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,\" \nOda Mae stops. She turns back to the buzzer and rings once more. Suddenly Molly answers. \nMOLLY (V.O.) Hello, who's there? \nODA MAE (nervous) Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I called you last night. Your friend Sam says you gotta talk to me. \nThere is a CLICK as Molly hangs up. \nINT. LOFT - DAY \nMolly walks away from the intercom, shaken. Suddenly we hear Oda Mae yelling up from the street. \nODA MAE (O.S.) Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to me! this is for real. Sam is here. He needs to talk to you. \nMolly walks over to the window and looks down. Oda Mae is standing in the street looking up. She is calling out at the top of her lungs. Molly pulls back. She is afraid. \nODA MAE (O.S.) (continuing) He says remember the starfish at Montego Bay? Remember the picture he took a' you in Reno? (pause) Remember his green underwear, the pair you wrote your name on? She wrote her name on 'em? \nMolly tenses. There is a sign of recognition in her eyes. \nEXT. TRIBECA STREET - DAY \nOda Mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to Molly's fifth floor window. Several people stare at her curiously. She turns to them. \nODA MAE Hey, do you mind? This here's a private conversation. \nThe people turn away. She turns back to the window. Sam prompts her. \nSAM Ask her about the sweater in the closet, the one she knitted that's too big. \nODA MAE What about the sweater you knitted that was too big? \nODA MAE Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's between worlds. It happens sometimes, when their spirits get out too quick. He thinks he still has stuff t'do down here. \nSAM Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling. \nODA MAE Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude. \nMolly stares at Oda Mae. \nSAM I do not have an attitude. \nODA MAE (to Molly) We're having a discussion. (back to Sam) Whataya mean, you're not angry? If you weren't angry you wouldn't be raisin' your voice like that. \nSAM Goddamn it, Oda Mae! \nODA MAE Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't talk to anybody who takes the Lord's name in vain. \nShe stands up, as if to leave. Molly watches with growing discomfort as Oda Mae seems to be talking to herself. \nSAM Relax, Oda Mae. \nODA MAE You relax. You're the dead one. You want my help, then you apologize. Nobody talks to me like that, understand? \nSAM Jesus Christ! \nODA MAE (to Molly) Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go. \nOda Mae heads for the door. Molly is confused. \nMOLLY I don't believe I'm watching this. \nSAM Damn it. All right. I apologize. \nOda Mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch. Sam, relieved, paces back and forth. \nOda Mae's eyes follow his voice as Molly watches her curiously. \nSAM (continuing) Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying. You gotta tell her word for word. \nODA MAE Monsieur has a message for you. \nSAM Molly, you're in danger. \nODA MAE You can't tell her like that. And would you stop movin' all over the place? You're makin' me sick. \nMolly looks concerned. Sam leans into Oda Mae. \nSAM Say it! \nODA MAE He's sayin' you're in danger. \nMOLLY Danger?... What do you mean? \nSAM I know the man who killed me. Willie Lopez. I know where he lives. \nODA MAE He says he knows the man who killed him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican. \nMolly grows pale as she listens. Her forehead tightens. \nSAM Write it down. \nODA MAE Write it down. \nSAM You do it! \nODA MAE Now I'm a secretary. \nOda Mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil. \nSAM 321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D. \nODA MAE 321? Hey, that's my neighborhood. \nOda Mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it to Molly. \nSAM Molly, he's got my wallet and my key. He was in here. \nODA MAE He's got his wallet and key. He was in here. \nMOLLY In here? \nSAM (directly to Molly) You have to go to the police. The Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a setup, Moll. I was murdered. \nODA MAE He says he was set up, that he was murdered. He wants you to go to the police. \nMolly stands up, afraid. Oda Mae stands up, too. \nODA MAE (continuing) I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to do with this. \nWILLIE What the hell are you talking about? I haven't said a word. \nSam is staggered. His body is shaking. \nCARL She knows your name, goddamn it! She knows where you live! \nWILLIE A lot of women know where I live. \nCarl is fuming. \nCARL This isn't a joke, man. You find that bitch, whoever she is, and... get rid of her, you hear me? I've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer. If I don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, I'm dead. If I lose Balistrari's money, we're both dead. \nWILLIE Tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month. \nCARL What is wrong with you? Is everything a joke? You were supposed to steal his wallet. You weren't supposed to kill him. Was that a joke? \nWILLIE (casually) I did you a favor. Freebee. \nCARL Jesus! (sickened) These are drug dealers, man. (pause) Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've risked my job here. I could go to jail. A hundred thousand of that money goes to me. Now give me Sam's key. I'll get that address book myself. \nWillie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key. Sam, unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. Hauling back, he slugs Carl with all his might. His fist has no impact. \nSAM You killed me, Carl. You had me killed. Look what you've done to me! Look what you've done! \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCarl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside him, yelling right into his face. \nHe is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl doesn't hear him. \nSAM You fucker! You mother fucker! I had a life, Goddamn you. I had a life! \nFrom the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is nothing he can do. \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY \nMolly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab. She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling. \nMOLLY You white fascist bigot. Who do you think you are? Bed Stuy's part of New York, you know. This is America. \nThe driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger. \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - ELEVATED TRAIN - DAY \nMolly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street. She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as she passes. \nWOMAN Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'? \nMolly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and run away. \nTRACKING SHOT \nWhen Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking. \nEXT./INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING \nMolly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby. It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away, afraid. \nINT. LIVINGROOM - DAY \nA dresser drawer opens and a box labeled \"Sam's Things -- Valuable\" is slowly pulled out. A hand reaches inside it and extracts Sam's address book. As THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom. Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code numbers he finds in the back. His eyes sparkle with excitement. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nMolly is sitting in a room opposite DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS BEIDERMAN, 48, and SERGEANT DOROTHY WALLACE, 29. Both officers are staring at her as she speaks. She seems very uncomfortable. \nMOLLY Look, you've gotta believe me. I don't even believe this stuff, myself. But this is real. Do you think I'd come here if it wasn't real? You told me to come if I had any new information. Well, here I am. \nThe officers don't respond. \nMOLLY (continuing) Don't look at me like that. You guys use psychics all the time. \nThere is dead silence. \nMOLLY (continuing) Damn it. I know how this sounds. I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe. But this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details. \nWALLACE How intimate? \nMOLLY Things Sam only said to me. \nWALLACE (smirking) Okay, let me get this straight. According to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?... (she stands up) I'm sorry. I've got important things to do. \nShe leaves the room. Molly gives her a dirty look and turns to Beiderman. \nMOLLY I'm telling you. The killer's name is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. You've got to check it out. \nSgt. Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly. \nMolly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes. \nSAM Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need you. \nSuddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps. \nMolly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled. \nMOLLY Who's there? \nCARL Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up? \nSam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding up the stairs. \nSAM Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll! \nThere is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant, almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is still in a suit and tie. \nCARL Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you. I felt bad about last night. This supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. I don't even read horoscopes. \nMOLLY Don't worry. It's okay. \nCARL No it's not. You needed me to hear you and I didn't and that was wrong. I want you to know that I'm your friend, Moll. \nSAM You were never our friend. \nCARL (holding out a paper bag) Hey, I brought you some Japanese apple pears. I know you like them. \nMOLLY (taking the bag) Oh, that's so sweet. \nCARL Listen, can I come in for a minute? I won't stay long. I've had one of those days. Maybe a cup of coffee? \nSAM No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him in! \nMOLLY (hesitating) Sure. \nOMITTED \nINT. LIVINGROOM - NIGHT \nCarl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on the couch drinking coffee. We notice that Carl is wearing yellow suspenders. Sam is beside himself, watching them. \nMOLLY Are you alright? You look nervous, upset. \nCARL (glancing at her thighs) What can I tell you. It's been tough. Hell, you know. It still hurts so much. (he poses sadly) Then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. They've given me my own accounts, but I've had no time to adjust. My mind has been reeling. \nMolly reaches out and pats his arm. There is an awkward pause. \nCARL (continuing) Where were you this morning? I thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers. \nMOLLY I didn't have time. (beat) I went to the police, Carl. \nSam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens. He laughs nervously. \nCARL You're kidding. You really did it? I don't believe... What did you tell them? What did they say? \nMOLLY You were right, you know. I felt like such a fool. They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. It was awful. \nCARL (relieved) A ripoff artist, huh? \nSAM (shocked) Molly, no. \nMOLLY The sad part is that I believed her. I believed her, Carl. (pause) It was all a sham. \nCARL (relaxing) Sometimes we need to believe. \nMOLLY Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe anything anymore. Why would people do such things? \nSam is devastated. \nCARL (milking it) It's hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold facts of it. What you have to remember is the love you felt. That's what's real. You have to remember how good Sam was. How much he loved you. \nMolly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair. \nCARL (continuing) You were everything to him, Molly. You were his life. \nMOLLY (finally crying) I feel so alone. \nCARL You're not alone. You're young. You've got so much talent. You're fantastically gorgeous. \nMOLLY (appreciating his words) Oh God, I don't know what's real anymore. I don't know what to think. \nCARL Just think about Sam. Think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were. \nCarl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek. \nCARL (continuing) Let your feelings out. \nWith surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and sends it shooting across the subway platform. \nGHOST (continuing) It's all in the anger. You gotta direct it. You gotta channel it. \nSAM I'm angry all the time. It doesn't do a thing. \nGHOST Cause you're angry all over. You gotta be angry here, in the pit of your stomach. Bring it down here. Let it explode. (he makes an explosive gesture) It's like a reactor, you know. Pow! \nHe kicks a Coke can toward Sam. Sam tries to kick it back and misses. The Ghost laughs. Sam gets angry. He tries again and falls on his head. The Ghost laughs louder. Now Sam is really angry. We see him forcing the anger down into his stomach. He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the can with all his might. To his shock and amazement, it sails right through the Ghost's head. The Ghost smiles. \nSAM I did it! \nGHOST Way to go. \nCUT TO: \nSAM \npracticing. He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his fist. Nothing happens. \nGHOST From your gut. What do I keep tellin' you? \nSam's stomach bulges. He tries again. Nothing. \nGHOST (continuing) Give it time! What else have you got? \nUndaunted, Sam tries once more. This time the tennis shoe moves. The Ghost nods his head approvingly. Sam is thrilled. \nSAM How long have you been here? \nGHOST Since they pushed me. \nSAM Someone pushed you? \nGHOST Yeah, someone pushed me! \nSAM Who? \nGHOST What? You don't believe me? You think I fell? You think I jumped? Well, fuck you! (an unexpected rage starts to build) It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed to go! I'm not supposed to be here! \nVenom spews from the Ghost's mouth. Suddenly he rams a cigarette machine full force with his head. The glass SHATTERS and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere. He throws himself on top of them with terrible longing. \nGHOST (continuing) I'd give everything for a drag. Just one drag. \nHe rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the cigarettes in all directions. Suddenly he looks up and sees Sam. He is unable to control his fury. \nGHOST (continuing) Who the hell are you? Why are you hounding me like this? Leave me alone. \nAN EXPRESS TRAIN \nis shooting through the station. The Ghost throws himself into it and in an instant he is gone. \nOMITTED \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT \nSam, all alone, walks through the station. Suddenly, he reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid. It swings back and forth. He is delighted. A beer can is sitting on a bench. He pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with childlike glee. \nLooking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. \"Special Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you.\" Something registers in Sam's eyes. He yells and jumps straight up, hitting a subway sign with his finger. With great excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the station. \nOMITTED \nINT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT \nORTISHA JONES, a black woman with brassy red hair, is sitting at Oda Mae's seance table surrounded by several of her relatives. Clara and Louise stand behind Oda Mae helping with the ritual. Oda Mae goes into her trance. \nANGLE \nA GROUP OF GHOSTS is milling behind Oda Mae. Sam comes barging into the room and looks at them in amazement. \nSAM What the hell? \nOda Mae, startled, jumps up in her chair. Everyone else jumps, too. Clara and Louise look worried. \nODA MAE Sam? \nSAM What is all this? What's goin' on? \nODA MAE What'd you do, tell every spook in town about me? I got spooks from out of town here. There's stuff goin' on you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly believe it myself. \nOrtisha and her relatives look up, confused. \nSAM Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is for real. How do you like that? \nODA MAE I don't. \nSAM Come on. Look at this. You're doing great. \nODA MAE I want everybody out. \nORTISHA Orlando? \nOrtisha looks around the room, befuddled. Clara and Louise aren't sure what to do. \nODA MAE Now! \nOrtisha and her relatives scurry out fast. The ghosts, too, begin passing through the wall. Oda Mae lays her head on the table. Suddenly her whole body begins heaving. She is starting to cry. Sam is surprised. \nSAM Oda Mae, what's wrong? \nODA MAE Out! I said out! That means you, too! \nSam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the others through the wall. \nOMITTED \nINT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT \nClara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in. \nCLARA Oda Mae, there's a man here who says he has to see you right away. \nODA MAE I ain't seein' nobody. \nWillie pushes his way into the room. Clara isn't sure what to do. Oda Mae looks up. She does not know him. \nWILLIE Are you the one that can talk to the dead? \nODA MAE I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing customers right now. \nWILLIE I said I need to know if you're the one. \nODA MAE I'm the one. But not now. \nWILLIE This is important. I have a friend. He died recently. Some say he was mugged. I think he was murdered. \nOda Mae stares at him curiously. \nWILLIE (continuing) I'm told you can contact people like that. Is that true? \nODA MAE It's been known to happen. But it's not gonna happen now, so come back later. \nWILLIE I can't wait til later. \nHe sits down across from Oda Mae and shows no signs of leaving. Oda Mae observes him quietly for a moment. \nODA MAE What's your friend's name? \nWILLIE Good question. Why don't you tell me? \nOda Mae glares at him. \nWILLIE (continuing) You're the psychic, right? \nODA MAE This ain't no guessin' game. \nWILLIE Then what is it, lady? \nODA MAE Lookit, I don't know what your trouble is... (getting nervous) Who are you? \nWILLIE You're the mindreader. I hear you've been tellin' people about me for days. What's my name? \nANGLE - ODA MAE \nconfused and uncomfortable. Sam comes wandering back into the room. His eyes bulge. \nSAM Willie! \nODA MAE Willie!? \nWillie sits straight up in his chair, amazed. \nWILLIE How'd you know that? \nODA MAE Because I'm psychic. \nWith a sudden thrust, Oda Mae sends her foot shooting into Willie's balls. As he recoils she knocks the table into his lap and rushes for the closet. We see her barricade herself in the hidden chamber. \nWillie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can stop him, BLASTS his gun at the closet door. It is riddled with bullets. Sam screams out. Willie runs to the side door and escapes to the street. Clara and Louise come rushing in. \nSam charges into the closet and sees that Oda Mae is safe behind the false door. Then he hurries to the street. \nOMITTED \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nINT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nIt is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn. \nSequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, smiling. \nSAM Search, you bastard! You'll never find it. It's gone. (he smiles) They'll kill you for this, Carl. You and Willie. They'll wipe you off the face of the earth. \nIn a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing is working. \nPanicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it back on again. Carl stares at it. \nCARL What the...? \nCarl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. The word \"M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R\" is emerging before him. \nCarl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman. \nCARL (continuing) Who's doing that? \nThere is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word appears. \"S-A-M\". \nCarl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for breath. \nSam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his ribs. \nSAM You bastard! You goddamn bastard! \nCarl grabs his side. \nCARL Ah! \nHe hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain. \nSAM It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you have a date with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch? \nSam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles over as though he's going to throw up. \nCARL Jesus! Oh God! \nSam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes stark white as the attack continues. \nThen, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room. \nINT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT \nMolly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does not look well. Sam is with him. \nMOLLY Carl? Where were you? I thought we were having...? \nCARL I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. I completely forgot. \nSAM Old Carl had a little trouble at the office. \nMOLLY Forgot? I was worried. Is everything okay? Are you all right? \nCARL I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I talk to you for minute? Can I come in? \nMolly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft. \nCARL (continuing) I need to ask you a question. \nSAM He needs to borrow four million dollars. \nCARL Molly, I know what the police said, but when you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you feel? What did he say? \nMOLLY Why? What happened? \nCARL (very tense) Molly, that psychic woman, I want to know what she told you. I want to know what she said. \nMOLLY Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. I told you. It wasn't real. She's a charlatan. (she hesitates and stares at Carl) Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today? \nSAM Oh shit! \nCARL (gulping) At the bank? \nSam tenses. He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop. \nMOLLY I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says she was taking out money. It turns out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something. \nCarl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick. \nMOLLY (continuing) What's wrong? \nCARL Stomach. My stomach. Do you have anything? Pepto Bismol. \nMOLLY (worried) Sure. Just a second. What's going on? \nSAM They're heading for the door. \nODA MAE (terrified) Jesus have mercy. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nWillie forces open a back door. They head into the building. \nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nOda Mae and the others hurry into the hall. They rush down the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbor's door. A WOMAN opens it a crack. \nODA MAE Emergency! Let us in! \nWOMAN Who you kiddin'? \nThe Woman slams the door and locks it shut. Oda Mae looks frightened. \nINT. APARTMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nCarl and Willie climb the stairs two at a time. \nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nOda Mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door. No one is home. Across the corridor an ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her head out to see what is going on. Before she can say anything they push their way inside. \nELDERLY WOMAN What're you doin'? You can't come in here. The cat don't like visitors. She'll pee all over the couch. You wanna pay for... \nOda Mae grabs the woman's mouth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - FISHEYE LENS VIEW \njust as Willie and Carl emerge from the stairwell. They head down the hall toward Oda Mae's door. Willie pulls out a gun, and fires. The lock shoots open. They rush inside. \nCUT BACK TO: \nODA MAE \nin the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the peephole. The old woman is struggling and still trying to talk. Oda Mae's knees are wobbling. \nODA MAE They're gonna find us. \nSAM No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em. \nODA MAE Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that? \nSAM Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I? \nINT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT \nWillie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun pointed, ready to fire. He seems furious when he realizes no one is there. \nWILLIE Looks like someone just left. \nCARL I'll check the building. \nANGLE \nHe rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway is empty. \nAs Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie nearly jumps out of his skin. \nWILLIE Damn! \nHe stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant, a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked. \nSuddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie spins around in total dismay. \nSummoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the room. Sam laughs. \nWILLIE (continuing) Who's there? Who's doing that? \nANGLE \nA pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself. \nWillie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees. \nWILLIE Oh God! \nThere is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as the word \"B-O-O!\" emerges before him. He cries out. \nWILLIE (continuing) Let me outta here! \nShaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror. Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs hold of the door and yanks it open. \nMOLLY (screaming) Why are you doing this to me? Get away from me! I know all about you. You're a fake. You're just a fake. Leave me alone! \nWe see Sam's inside the room with Molly. He gazes at her lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae. \nSAM Tell her she's wearing the blouse I spilled the Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas. \nODA MAE Sam says you're wearin' the blouse he spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas. \nCUT BACK TO: \nMOLLY \ngrabbing hold of her beads. Her hand is shaking. \nODA MAE (O.S.) (continuing) See, I'm no fake. \nMOLLY Go away! \nSAM Gimme a penny quick. \nODA MAE What? \nSAM Empty your purse. On the floor. Now. \nOda Mae obeys. A pile of coins falls on the floor. \nSAM (continuing) Push a penny under the door. \nOda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft. Molly sees it. Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the bottom of the door. Pushing gently, he moves the penny up the door until it's eye level with Molly. She watches it, amazed. \nThen, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the door and hovers in the air. There is a look of wonder in Molly's eyes as it floats toward her. \nSAM (continuing; calling to Oda Mae) Tell her it's for luck. \nODA MAE (O.S.) Sam says it's for luck. \nMolly stands there dumbfounded. Her face is completely white. After a moment she reaches for the penny. It falls into her hand. There are tears in her eyes. \nCUT TO: \nHALLWAY \nOda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins to open. Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly. She hesitates for a long moment and then invites Oda Mae in. \nINT. LOFT - NIGHT \nMolly is on the phone. Oda Mae is beside her. \nMOLLY Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. We're a red brick building with the entrance on the left side. Please hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be waiting right here. (she hangs up) Police are on their way. \nOda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch. \nMOLLY What do we do now? \nODA MAE Just wait. \nThere is a period of awkward silence. \nMOLLY Is Sam here? \nSAM I'm sitting beside you. \nODA MAE (pointing) Right here. \nMolly reaches out tentatively. Sam meets her hand. She flinches for a second but does not pull back. \nMOLLY (fingering the air) Can you feel me, Sam? \nSAM With all my heart. \nODA MAE With all his heart, he says. \nSAM I'd give anything to be alive again, just to feel you once more. \nODA MAE He wishes he could touch you, just one more time. \nMOLLY Oh, Sam. \nOda Mae looks away uncomfortably. The CAMERA HOLDS on her face. After a moment she turns around and addresses the air. \nODA MAE Okay, damn it, you can use me if you want. \nSam looks oddly at Oda Mae. \nODA MAE (continuing) Come on. Before I change my mind. \nSuddenly he understands what she means. \nCarl runs to the fire escape window. He looks out just in time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window. \nINT. NEW LOFT - NIGHT \nMolly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under construction. It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls. The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them half to death. They rush blindly toward the front door. It won't open. \nODA MAE Back to the fire escape. Head for the roof. \nOda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears on the other side. She screams. Carl tries shoving the window open. It won't budge. \nMolly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. There is an opening at the top. \nMOLLY This way! \nMolly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the roof. \nWith a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside. The window slams behind him. \nOda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a loose cable and she falls to the ground. \nODA MAE Help us, Sam! \nOMITTED \nODA MAE \nA hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the floor. \nCARL I want the check. Just give me the check. \nMolly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream. \nMOLLY (screaming) God almighty, Carl! What are you doing? What have you done!? \nShe descends quickly and runs toward Carl. \nCARL Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's not her money. \nCarl kicks Oda Mae. Molly rushes at him, attacking him violently. Carl aims his gun at her. \nCARL (continuing) Keep out of this, Molly! \nHe grabs Oda Mae by the hair. \nCARL (continuing) Where is it? \nOda Mae cries out. \nODA MAE In my purse. \nCARL Where? \nODA MAE Over there. \nShe points across the room. \nCarl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it. Yanking it off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. There is no check. He grabs Oda Mae. \nCARL Where is it, goddamn it? Where is it? \nODA MAE I gave it away. \nCARL You're lying! Don't lie to me! \nHe aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when, suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there. \nIn total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs Molly and aims his gun at her head. \nCARL (continuing) I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give me the check. \nThe gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the camera dollies toward Carl. \nCARL (continuing) Sam, please. I didn't mean for him to kill you. It's not my fault. Come on, Sam, give me the check. Give it to me and I'll leave her alone. \nNothing happens. Carl looks nervous. \nANGLE \nCARL Sam? Sam? \nIn a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack. \nCarl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the door. The lock explodes and the door flies open. \nCarl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The apartment looks like a scene from another world. \nCarl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot see him. \n", "test1_input": "SAM (sarcastic) Oh my God... \nOda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room. \nODA MAE I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. Now I got two souls I gotta contact. I don't know about that. It's difficult, you know. The pain. The effort. \nMRS. SANTIAGO I pay more. How much? How much? \nODA MAE Twenty dollars. \nSAM Way to go. Milk her for every penny. \nOda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither can Oda Mae. \nMrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up into their sockets. \nCLARA/LOUISE Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. \nOda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly her whole body stiffens. \nCLARA/LOUISE (continuing) Have mercy! Have mercy! \nMrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes a normal pose. \nAfter several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on theatricality, it is strangely convincing. \nODA MAE Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are fortunate today. The channel is clear. Many spirits are gathering. \nSAM (scanning the room) Yeah? Where? \nOda Mae jerks. Her eyes dart nervously around the room. \nMRS. SANTIAGO My husband? \nODA MAE (a bit uneasy) I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, he is drawing toward us now. I can see him coming. \nMRS. SANTIAGO Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he look? \nODA MAE Oh, he is a very handsome man. \nMRS. SANTIAGO (surprised) Handsome? \nODA MAE In our Father's Kingdom we are all handsome. \nMRS. SANTIAGO (understanding) Julio! \nSam looks on dismayed. \nODA MAE He is standing before me. He is wearing a black suit. \nMRS. SANTIAGO A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was buried in that. \nMrs. Santiago begins to cry. Sam looks around the room with growing disgust. Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells into her ear. \nSAM What a crock of shit! \nOda Mae nearly falls off her chair. She spins around. \nODA MAE Who's there? \nSam is stunned. Clara and Louise look at one another in total confusion. This is obviously not part of the act. Mrs. Santiago seems frightened. \nODA MAE (continuing) Where are you? \nSAM (looking around) Who? \nOda Mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air. Her knee kicks the table and sends it toppling. Mrs. Santiago is terrified. \nMRS. SANTIAGO Julio! Julio! \nSAM What's going on? \nODA MAE Get out of here! Leave me alone! \nMrs. Santiago doesn't know what to do. She begins to cry. \nSAM Who are you talking to? \nClara runs up to Oda Mae. \nODA MAE Keep him away! \nLouise looks at the empty room. \nSAM Are you talking to me? \nODA MAE Do something. Help me. \n", "test1_true": "SAM I don't believe this. Hey you. My name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me? Sam Wheat! \nODA MAE Stop it! \nSAM Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it! \nCLARA Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something. \nODA MAE Sam Wheat! \nSam nearly falls on his face. Clara's eyes widen. She is more confused than ever. \nSAM Jesus! \nCLARA Samweet? \nOda Mae runs into the closet. \nIt has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left side and she barricades herself inside it. Clara and Louise stand outside pulling on the handle. They seem frightened. \nCLARA/LOUISE Oda Mae! Oda Mae! \nINT. CLOSET - DAY \nOda Mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying. Sam's feet enter the frame beside her. \nODA MAE Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I promise, Lord. I don't want to go to hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a penance. Just make him go away. \nSAM Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right here! \nOda Mae screams, jumps back into the closet, and bolts up against the door. It tears from its hinges and falls into the seance room, nearly crushing Louise. Mrs. Santiago runs out screaming. Oda Mae takes one look around and collapses in a dead faint. \nOMITTED \nINT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - DAY \nBeads of sweat collect on Oda Mae's brow and cheeks. She seems feverish. Clara and Louise are sitting beside her with damp towels nervously soaking up the perspiration. Oda Mae appears to be talking to herself until we PULL BACK and reveal Sam nearby. \nODA MAE My mama, her mama, may they rest in peace, they had de gift. Mama always said I had it, but I never did. She tol' me all about it, how it felt an' all. But now that it's happenin' I don't know what to do. You're scarin' me half to death. Please, you gotta go away, you gotta find someone else. \nClara and Louise look at one another with growing concern. \nSAM Someone else? Are you outta your mind? \nODA MAE I'm gettin' there fast. (she pushes Louise's hand) Leave me alone. \nSAM Not till you help me. \nODA MAE Where are you? \nLOUISE Where? I'm right here. \nSAM I'm standing right beside you. \nODA MAE (mimicking his words) \"I'm standing right beside you.\" (she pauses and looks up) Are you white? \nSAM What? \nODA MAE Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why me? \nLouise looks at her sister and shakes her head. \nSAM Listen, damn it. You can help me. There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's in terrible danger. The man who killed me broke into our apartment. He's going to go back. You've gotta warn her. \nODA MAE Why would she listen to me? \nSAM She has to! This man's a killer! He's got a key. \nODA MAE Forget it, mister. I can't. \nSAM It's just a phone call. You're all I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin' till you help me. I don't sleep anymore, so I can sit here day and night. I don't care how long it takes. I can talk forever. \nOda Mae gulps, a horrified expression on her face. \nINT. LOFT - DAY \nThe telephone rings. Molly, preparing dinner, runs to answer it. \nMOLLY Hello. \nODA MAE (V.O.) Molly? Is this Molly speaking? \nMOLLY Yes. \nODA MAE (V.O.) My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual reader and adviser. (she hesitates) I'm calling for a friend of yours. He asked me to call. This is important. You gotta believe me. Don't be afraid. \nMOLLY Who is this? \n", "test2_input": "SAM Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line. \nOda Mae nods and starts to sign \"Oda Mae\". Sam stops her. \nSAM (continuing) No, no, no. Rita Miller. \nODA MAE (to the officer) Can I have another one please? I signed the wrong name. \nSam hits his forehead with his hand. The Officer gives her another card. Oda Mae signs it. \nSAM Tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make. \nODA MAE I need you to put that in the third floor file cause I got a transfusion to make. \nOFFICER A what? \nODA MAE You know what I mean. (innocently) Umm, can I keep the pen? \nOFFICER (surprised, not sure what to say) ...uh, sure. \nOda Mae, delighted, walks away smiling and gives the officer a wave. She is loving this. \nODA MAE Thanks. \nINT. CARL'S OFFICE \nThe clock on Carl's wall says 3:40. He seems anxious. The phone RINGS. Carl jumps. He pushes down the speaker button. \nCARL Hello. Carl Bruner speaking. \nVOICE Carl? \nCARL Mr. Balsitrari \nVOICE Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John. I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio. \nCARL Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll pick it up later. \nHe hangs up. His hand is shaking. \nINT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nSam and Oda Mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing administrative personnel. They approach a GUARD who is standing there. \nSAM Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Furgeson. \nODA MAE Lyle Furgeson, please. \nGUARD Do you have an appointment? \nODA MAE No. I'm here for the fun of it. \nSAM Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's here. \nODA MAE Tell him Rita Miller's here. \nGUARD Just one moment, please. \nSAM Don't embellish. \nODA MAE Yes, Sir. \nGUARD (turning around) Excuse me? \nShe waves him on. \nSAM (whispering) Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk. \nODA MAE Why are you whispering? \nSAM (he doesn't know) Just be quiet and listen. I've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul. \nWe see the Guard leaning over Mr. Furgeson's desk. FURGESON looks up and sees Oda Mae. He shrugs his shoulders. \nSAM (continuing) He's a social moron. You don't have to worry about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. \nThe Guard comes back. \nGUARD What is this regarding? \nODA MAE What? He doesn't remember me? We were together at the Brewster's Christmas party. With his wife Shirley. They had that lovely tree... all those presents. Why, I'll never forget all those beautiful... \nSam pokes her. She yelps, surprised, and glances around. The Guard gives her an odd look. \nODA MAE (continuing) Oops. Gas. \nShe forces a smile. He smiles back and then goes over to Mr. Furgeson. \n", "test2_true": "The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear. Furgeson appears totally flummoxed. He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves. The Guard motions her to come back. She walks proudly over to his desk. He sticks out his hand. \nFURGESON Hello, hello. Of course, of course. It's been so long. \nODA MAE A long time. \nSAM Ask how Bobby and Snooky are. \nODA MAE How are Bobby and Snooky doin'? \nFURGESON (perplexed) Why, they're just fine, thank you. Nice of you to ask. And how is your... family? \nODA MAE Couldn't be better. \nFURGESON Well, isn't that wonderful. \nSAM Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities. \nODA MAE So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities? \nFURGESON (surprised) The Gibraltar securities! Well, it looks like we topped out, huh? \nSAM \"We sure did!\" \nODA MAE We sure did. \nFURGESON (impressed) That was a wonderful tip. \nSAM \"Good old Randy\". \nODA MAE Good old Randy. Got a real head on his shoulders. \nSAM \"Her\" shoulders. \nODA MAE \"Her\" shoulders. \nFURGESON Sure does. Well... well. So what brings you here today? \nSAM You're closing an account. \nODA MAE I'm closing an account. \nFURGESON Well... wonderful. Do you have your account number? \nSAM \nODA MAE \nSAM \nShe looks up into the air. Furgeson eyes her strangely. \nODA MAE Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm dyslexic. \nHe punches Rita Miller's number into the computer. A figure appears on the screen. He stares at it for a few seconds and then punches it in again. \nFURGESON (trying to be calm) Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing four million dollars from us today, is that correct? \nODA MAE Four million dollars?! \nSAM Say \"yes\"! \nODA MAE (gasping) Yes! Four million. That's right. That's right. \nFURGESON And how will you want that? \nODA MAE Tens and twenties? \nFURGESON Pardon? \nSAM A cashier's check! Tell him a cashier's check. \nODA MAE A cashier's check. \nFURGESON Fine. Of course, you realize we're required to get some identification from everyone. It's just procedural. You understand. \nODA MAE Of course. \nOda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles. \nODA MAE You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long. \nThe Officer nods appreciatively. \nINT. CARD FILE ROOM - DAY \nFurgeson lays Oda Mae's ID next to her signature card. The signatures match up. He nods his head in approval. \n", "test3_input": "INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY \nCarl looks up at the clock. It is 3:50. He pushes down a button on the phone. A SECRETARY answers. \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Yes, Mr. Bruner. \nCARL Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. It's on the rolodex. \nINT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nMr. Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a cashier's check for $4,000,000. Oda Mae's hand shakes as she examines it. \nFURGESON I'll just need your signature right here. \nODA MAE Sure. \nSAM Sign Rita Miller. \nSam looks up and gulps. Molly has just entered the bank and is heading toward them. He jumps up nervously. \nSAM (continuing) I'll be back in a minute. You're on your own. Don't say anything foolish. \nOda Mae signs a form closing the account. Of course the signatures match. Mr. Furgeson examines them both and smiles. He shakes Oda Mae's hand. \nFURGESON Now you be careful with this. It's like carrying cash, you know. \nODA MAE (positively glowing) I sure do. \nSam rushes over to Molly. He is not sure what to do. He notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused, thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam, delighted, flicks another stack. \nOda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her. \nODA MAE (continuing) Then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps. Every gas station has 'em you know, sometimes six or more. It adds up. \nSAM Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out of here. Say goodbye. \nODA MAE (abruptly getting up) Well, I've got to leave. It's been a pleasure doin' business with you. Say \"hi\" to Shirley and Snooky for me. \nFURGESON Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to. \nOda Mae smiles and leaves. There is a new lilt in her walk. Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up. \nSAM Hurry up, Oda Mae. \nAt that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground. She stoops down and picks it up. \nODA MAE (excitedly) What a day! \nMolly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after her. Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment and then looks back across to the executive area. She sees Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him. \nMOLLY Lionel? \nHe is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous. \nFURGESON Molly. How are you? \nMOLLY Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady, about my height, did you see her? \nFURGESON Well, yes. I just took care of her. \nMOLLY What did she want? Did it have anything to do with me? Did she ask about Sam? \nFURGESON (not understanding) Sam? No. Why? \nMOLLY Was her name Oda Mae Brown? \nFURGESON No, Rita Miller. She just closed an account. \nMolly stares at Furgeson. She is not sure what to think. \nFURGESON (continuing) Is there a problem? \nMOLLY (hesitating, not sure what to say) No. I guess not. Thanks. \nShe walks away, confused. \nINT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY \nCarl, in front of his computer, is going crazy. He keeps punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears over and over on the screen. \"RITA MILLER, #926-31043. ACCOUNT CLOSED. BALANCE $00.00.\" \nPanicked, Carl jumps up. He moves quickly, erratically around the office and then back to the computer. He punches the keys over and over. The same answer appears on the screen. The account is closed. \nHALL OUTSIDE CARL'S OFFICE \nCarl runs through the office. He seems crazed. People look at him. \nLEEDEN Carl, is something wrong? \n", "test3_true": "LEEDEN What? \nCARL Is this a joke? One of my accounts is closed. \nLEEDEN Which account? What's wrong? \nCarl freezes. He doesn't answer. \nLEEDEN (continuing) You want me to call someone? \nCARL (changing his demeanor) No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's all right. I can do it. \nEXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY \nSam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself. \nODA MAE $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty. \nSAM Oda Mae. Take the check out of your purse. \nShe stops. There is a nervous look on her face. \nODA MAE Take it out? Why? \nSAM Just do it. \nOda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly. \nSAM (continuing) Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller. \nODA MAE (in shock) Endorse it? Why? \nSAM Do what I say. \nODA MAE No! \nSAM That's blood money, Oda. I was killed for that money. Endorse it now. \nODA MAE What are you going to do with it? \nSAM We're giving it away. \nODA MAE Away? What do you mean? To who? \nSAM Look to your left. \nOda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless. She recoils. \nODA MAE Are you outta your mind? \nSAM Do what I tell you. \nODA MAE No! (clutching the check) I can't. \nSAM Yes, you can. If you don't do it, they'll track you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now. \nODA MAE Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam. \nSAM I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go to heaven for this. \nOda Mae growls at him. \nWith great difficulty, she approaches the nuns. \nThe nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion. \nSAM Write \"St. Joseph's Shelter\". \nWith great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert their eyes from the check. \nNUN Bless you, child. \nOda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over. \nSAM I'm proud of you. \nODA MAE Don't you talk to me. I don't want you comin' round no more. I mean it. Understand? \nSAM Come on, we're friends. \nODA MAE Friends? Friends? \nShe turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after her. \nSAM I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae. \nShe growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an attempt to revive her. \n"}

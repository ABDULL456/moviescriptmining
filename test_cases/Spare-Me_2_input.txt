THEO (struggling to get away) What did you do to Buzz? 
JUNIOR You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. (he grabs Theo's throat) 
THEO (hoarsely) I don't want to play. 
Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can't reach it, by millimeters. 
JUNIOR To play, I press my fingers on a throat like this... (he presses tighter on Theo's windpipe) ...and then the mans face would go blue and I should keep pressing... (Theo's face goes pale blue) ...and I did and then he stopped moving and he didn't play anymore after that. Theo bends back a finger on Junior's hand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and releases Theo's neck. Theo GASPS for air. 
JUNIOR You didn't play fair. (stands up) You were almost blue. 
Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to bash Junior in the head. 
JUNIOR Go ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I'm your biggest fan. Junior offers Theo his unprotected head. 
JUNIOR (yelling) Come on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH! 
Theo bashes Junior in the head with the ball. It bounces off Junior's head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley. 
JUNIOR Thank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you! 
Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away. As he crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on Theo's head. 
JUNIOR I can have her,you know. (looks around and whispers) She's not my real sister. (he flashes a lecherous smile) THEO'S POV A ball pops up at the far end of the return and TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo. The ball hits Theo's face with a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." THEO'S BOWLING SHOE ATTIRED FEET Being dragged down the lane. Theo comes to and looks down his body to see the empty lane. He looks up to see Junior pulling him towards the pin reset machine. The cut on Theo's forehead bleeds down the side of his face. 
JUNIOR (muttering) Lubrication. 
MACHINE NUMBER 6 
Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and positions him under the pins. As Junior prepares the machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled. Junior begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and his malfunctioning arm. Theo rolls away as Junior's flailing releases the machine. It comes slamming down on Junior just as Theo slips out of harm's way. He gets up and staggers away from the machine. Junior's HOWL echoes across the lanes. His twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device. Lane six goes dark. Theo limps up the lane. 
CUT TO: 
64     EXT. BRIDGE					64 
Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge. He stops and gets out. The night is silent. 
THEO (loud whisper) Sheila! Where are you? 
Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo. 
THEO (angry) You told Junior that we did it. 
SHEILA It? 
THEO It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer. 
SHEILA I told him you were my boyfriend. 
THEO (very pissed off) What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet! 
SHEILA We would have sooner or later.

BARBATUS Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot deserters! 
Z swallows hard. 
BARBATUS You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you. (off Z's look) Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind? 
Z Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. (nervously) So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition? 
BARBATUS No -- we're going to attack the termites! 
Z (alarmed) Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile! 
Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital. 
ANT SOLDIERS (to the tune of "When Johnny Comes Marching Home") We ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter termites just for fun, Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Z So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects? 
BARBATUS (grim smile) No such luck.  Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads! 
SOLDIER ANTS We ants go marching two by two, hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah! 
Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen, fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen... 
Z Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork? 
BARBATUS Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle! 
ANT SOLDIERS We ants are marching three by three, hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah! 
...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as they're getting stepped on... 
Z So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?! 
BARBATUS Superior numbers, kid! 
EXT. TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT 
Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts an order. 
COLONEL ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!! 
The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony...Z is swept along... 
BARBATUS Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!! 
Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance. Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very middle of the termite colony... 
Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around suspiciously. 
BARBATUS It's too damn quiet. 
Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over, and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear. 
BARBATUS Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back. 
Z (petrified) Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.

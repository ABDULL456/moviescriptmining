SIDNEY What do I do now?  Whistle "The Stars and Stripes Forever?" 
Mrs. Bartha slides along the seat, reaching for her fur. 
MRS. BARTHA 
CAMERA PULLS BACK with her as she collects her belongings, slides out between the tables and comes forward, passing Sidney to her husband. 
WIFE (lightly) What you do now, Mr. Falco, is crow like a hen - you have just laid an egg. 
She presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back, inviting him to put it around her shoulders. 
BARTHA AND WIFE 
ANOTHER ANGLE, favoring Bartha.  He has not fully understood the significance of his wife's gesture.  He studies her. She confirms his hopes as she adds: 
WIFE Leo, this is one of the cleanest things I've seen you do in years... 
With the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her husband's arm with some pride.  They walk away.  CAMERA ERASES BACK to include Sidney.  He is angry at himself - more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any sense of shame at the attempt. 
OTIS ELWELL 
A MEDIUM LONG SHOT.  At a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes. He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction.  Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards Sidney. 
SIDNEY 
Sidney's face shows a burning resentment.  He glances about him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been observed.  As he moves away, the waiter walks into shot, addressing him. 
WAITER 
A waiter approaches Sidney.  He has a message. 
WAITER Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney. 
The waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar. Sidney, his humiliation and rage still burning, looks off towards... 
OTIS ELWELL 
From Sidney's viewpoint.  Elwell beckons. 
SIDNEY 
He comes round the circular bar.  He shows no eagerness to join Elwell, but approaches the table.  Elwell makes a gesture, inviting Sidney to sit.  Sidney doesn't accept it. 
ELWELL (pleasantly) I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. (as Sidney starts to leave) Hey, wait a minute! 
SIDNEY (hesitating) I'm late for a date with a dame. 
Then, returning, he leans over the table addressing Elwell with quiet anger. 
SIDNEY Otis, if you're trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column - forget it! 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Across Sidney and Elwell.  Elwell is quietly enjoying Sidney's display of hurt dignity. 
ELWELL (affably) How is dear old J.J. by the way? 
SIDNEY (his anger relapsing) Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock. 
ELWELL (lightly) If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours... 
SIDNEY 
A CLOSE SHOT.  While Elwell continues, he is not looking at Sidney.  Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real - and this gives him a new idea. 
ELWELL (continuing over scene) ...Talk of a wake! - they'd club each other to cater the affair for free! 
RESUME ELWELL AND SIDNEY 
Elwell looks up at Sidney as he continues. 
ELWELL (happily) By the way, did I hear something about J.J. giving you the flit gun treatment - he shut you out of the column. (amused) Why? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker). 
SIDNEY You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! (a pause, then:) That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item." 
ELWELL (pleased) And, instead, he printed his heel in your face? 
SIDNEY (morose) I see you're full of human feelings... 
ELWELL 
He has lost interest in Sidney. 
ELWELL (with a shrug) Like most of the human race, Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile for a chuckle... 
Elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by... 
REVERSE ANGLE 
...three people are passing the table, squeezing their way past; a man with two very fetching young women.  Elwell's eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed. 
SIDNEY (noting Elwell's preoccupation) ...and two miles for a pretty girl...? 
ELWELL 
He is unembarrassed at Sidney's all-too-accurate estimate. 
ELWELL (lightly) Three...even four... 
Elwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered document case and some publications among which a columnist might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of semipornographic nature. 
ELWELL (continuing, casually) Then you're really washed up with Hunsecker...? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
The nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on Sidney.  With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down.  He produces the slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as illustration. 
SIDNEY This is how much I'm washed with J.J.... 
As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny - apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover. 
SIDNEY Look, Otis, I make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster. 
Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.

RODEN Of course it counts. How do you play? 
PILCHER (grins) Officer Starling. Welcome back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ENTOMOLOGY CORRIDOR - DAY 
MOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box. 
RODEN Where the hell did this one come from? It's practically mush. 
CLARICE You really don't want to know. 
PILCHER Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin. 
RODEN I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? (Clarice nods) Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I? 
PILCHER Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
VERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis. 
RODEN (O.S.) The whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it... The wings are just like wet tissue paper... 
THE TWO MEN 
are hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper. 
PILCHER (without looking up) What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling? 
CLARICE I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher. 
PILCHER Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...? 
CLARICE (smiles) Not lately. But maybe someday. 
He looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between them, before Roden straightens, exultant. 
RODEN Positive match! 
CLARICE You're sure? 
RODEN (points with his dental probe) West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer Starling, meet Mister Acherontia Styx. 
He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's specimen. She leans forward, intently. 
HER POV (MAGNIFICATION) 
the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull. 
RODEN (O.S.) Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth... 
PILCHER (O.S.) The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that? 
FAVORING CLARICE 
as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling. 
CLARICE And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies? 
PILCHER (shakes his head) They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs. 
CLARICE (pause, then softly) Dr. Lecter... 
As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - the wail of police SIRENS - and... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT) 
An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway patrol cruisers. 
The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers... 
CLOSER ANGLE 
on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) Maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs, starting with U.S. Customs... 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING) 
The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer. 
CRAWFORD (O.S.) Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers. Maybe, someday... 
CLARICE AND CRAWFORD 
sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention. 
CRAWFORD But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.

HARRY Oh yeah, absolutely.

39    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/FRONT YARD/DRIVEWAY - DAY                39 
Joan, accompanied by Duke, moves down the driveway to a mailbox in front of the broken gates. She pauses to lavish the DOG with an exuberant display of affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by leaping about and BARKING joyously: JOAN Alright now, don't play too rough. The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her: JOAN No, no, Duke, don't do that, that's not nice. Now sitz. And behave yourself. He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face, watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it. She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them as she starts back to the house with Duke following. They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well as a letter with her name written in pencil on the envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops suddenly: 
CLOSE ON JOAN'S HAND

40A   EXT. CAMPUS CONCESSION AREA - DAY                           40A 
Joan and Helen, seated at a table near the concessionary building. The latter sits, tense and disturbed, an uneaten sandwich in front of her, as Helen reads from a list of suspects. (Lewie can be seen at another table, seated across from a bearded man. The other members of the Chorale, including the male soloists, are variously seated, moving about, or lounging on the campus lawn, having their lunch.) 
HELEN (CONT'D) 'Lewie.   Mad at me.' 
The CAMERA PERUSES Lewie. 
HELEN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Doesn't want a divorce. Maybe he's trying to scare me, or punish me. Helen leans her head in close to Joan's: 
HELEN (CONT'D) It's definitely not Lewie. JOAN You're not exactly a disinterested party. You're always promoting his cause... HELEN Number one, I've known the man for fifteen years, number two, he... loves you. 
She glances at Eddy, then consults the list:                      * ON EDDY                                                           * 
seated on the lawn nearby, paring an apple with a Swiss           * Army knife:                                                       * HELEN (O.S.)                              * 'Eddy Revere, a little moody, but a good friend and very reliable. BACK TO HELEN                                                     * 
HELEN (CONT'D) An opinion I don't share, but... What do you think about Vincent?                        * (CONTINUED)

gesturing expansively, as he relates some incident to his table partners: HELEN (V.O.) He has a terrible temper. We know that. 
BACK TO HELEN                                                       * 
HELEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) 'Vincent Gallardo.  Doubtful. We've never had an unpleasant word.' Aren't you  lucky. 'Kenneth Dowler...'                                    * 
ON KENNETH DOWLER                                                   * He stands with a styrofoam cup in his hand, coming on to one of the members of the female chorus: 
HELEN 'Always trying to connect with me, proposing private rehearsals at his apartment.' You know what he asked me yesterday? 
BACK TO HELEN AND JOAN                                              * HELEN (CONT'D) What my cup size was.                                  * (back to the list) Steve Jewel! Who's Steve Jewel?

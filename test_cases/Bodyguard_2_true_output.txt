47   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GATE/GUARD HOUSE - DAY                47 In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of switches, lights and phones at his command. There are several TV screens; one of them shows a series of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of 
the grounds. On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust from the last few curves in the drive. Fletcher shakes his head. He's seen it all before. HENRY Is that Devaney? 
FLETCHER (to Frank) She's got him by the short ones, doesn't she, Frank? Frank squelches a smile at Henry.   Where did he learn that? FRANK Yeah, she makes him nervous. They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and hurries inside. 
48   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     48 Nicki is cutting fruit at the bar. Rachel, very tense, is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink she's making in a blender. Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her neck and shoulders. Spector is perched on a bar stool like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki gives him a look. RACHEL I want him gone. DEVANEY What is it now? NICKI He told Rachel no Sunday brunch at Charlie's. DEVANEY No Sunday brunch. That's why you called me up here? RACHEL That is not it! It's my money and my life and I want him out of here. DEVANEY Where is he? Nicki indicates through the glass door.    Devaney walks over to it. 
NICKI On the patio. RACHEL He's through messing with my life. 
DEVANEY Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes. (leaning out the glass door) Farmer! Would you come in here a minute? 
Devaney walks back toward Rachel. RACHEL Did you know he was nuts? SPECTOR Do you know who couldn't get past the gates yesterday? RACHEL Who? SPECTOR Robin Leach, that's who. Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from the sliding door. SPECTOR You think that's funny? The man talks to 20 million people and he can't even get in here. FRANK Did he have an appointment? Devaney turns to him. DEVANEY Farmer, what is this about brunch at Charlie's? Rachel's been going there every Sunday for the last five years. FRANK I don't want her doing anything she's always done. 
RACHEL (mimicking him) 'I don't want her doing anything she's always done.' The guy's a fanatic. DEVANEY So are the guys he's protecting you from. RACHEL Excuse me if I don't faint. NICKI Think of Fletcher -- 
Rachel turns ON the BLENDER, drowning out Nicki's voice. Frank looks at Rachel coolly. She stares at him petulantly, then turns OFF the BLENDER. RACHEL Do you know he's got the phones bugged? SPECTOR Oh Jesus, Bill. RACHEL Maybe he gets off listening to my calls. All that heavy breathing... DEVANEY (interrupting) What do you want from my life? RACHEL I want some peace around here. SPECTOR That's right. Devaney looks at Frank imploringly. FRANK We're almost done. RACHEL And I want to be able to eat brunch with my friends. FRANK Go on Tuesday this week. Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian. 
SPECTOR (stretching it out) Tuesday -- morning -- brunch. Where did you find this guy? Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank. 
48A   EXT. THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY                             48A Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.    It's a decidedly downscale area. A little way  off, a   group of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with interest. Henry sits  at the wheel. Tony  stands   by the open window, leaning against the car. 
HENRY (looking at the youths) I wish Rachel didn't keep coming here. It makes me nervous. TONY Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous 'cos I got you with me.

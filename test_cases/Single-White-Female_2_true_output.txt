SAM Naked skydiving ! 
ALLISON It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know. I've not been in New York long enough to know very many people. 
SAM Except me. 
ALLISON Oh, you're invited. 
They laugh. 
ALLISON And my friend Graham upstairs. 
SAM It won't be long before you know half the people in New York. People like you, you know... but I found you first. 
ALLISON You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. 
They start kissing very tenderly. 
Fade to two seconds of black screen. And then we see Sam and Allison asleep in the bed. They are naked but covered with the sheet. 
The phone rings. Allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset. 
ALLISON Hello ?... Hold on a second. 
She bends down to take the telephone set. 
ALLISON Sam, it's your ex-wife. She gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the phone. 
SAM What ? 
ALLISON It's Lisa. 
Sam puts the receiver to his ear. We hear vaguely Lisa's voice, but not precisely enough to understand the words. 
SAM Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now. 
He puts the handset back on the telephone set, which Allison had put on the bed. 
SAM I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here. 
ALLISON It's where you live. She's entitled. 
The phone rings again. Allison moves up to pick up the phone. 
SAM Don't... don't answer it. 
The phone keeps on ringing. Then the answering machine starts with «Hi, it's Allison Jones...» but the rest of the message is covered by Sam and Allison's conversation. 
SAM Why does she do this ? 
ALLISON Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that. We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison is walking naked in the hall. 
LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Hello, Sam. Oh, damn... Would you pick up the phone, please ? Hello ?... Please, don't do this to me. 
SAM (voice over) Lisa... 
LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this afternoon... 
Allison is standing up in the dark, not moving. We hear Sam's voice, partly from the bedroom, and partly from the answering machine, which gives the voice a sort of echo effect. SAM (voice over) Yeah... Lisa... Can we talk about this tomorrow ? 
LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then... 
Close-up on Allison's face in the dark. She looks very shocked by what she hears. 
SAM (voice over and yelling) Allie, Allie, I don't know how you shut that thing off. 
LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE You said you were going to call. 
Allison shuts the machine off. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on Sam's face. He picks up the phone and puts the handset to his ear. We hear Lisa's voice saying : «Hello, Sam» 
SAM Huh-huh... 
ALLISON'S APPARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison grabs a night-robe and presses it on her naked body. 
SAM (voice over) Okay ... goodbye. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam is seated on the bed. He puts the phone back on the set. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT ALLISON I take it back. She's not entitled.

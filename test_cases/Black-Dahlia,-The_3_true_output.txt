Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign... 
BUCKY Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if-- 
CLEO SHORT Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all away. Dreamin'll kill ya. (to Christine) You, too. Get me a sandwich. 
He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's hands. 
CLEO SHORT (cont'd) Clean up some dog shit with this for me, willya? 
The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short watches him go. 
EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK 
Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing the event on film. 
His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett revival: 
A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!" 
Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them. 
Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda Martin/Betty Short porn film. 
Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The light is green. 
He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE ADMIRAL THEATER - SOON AFTER 
Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK SENNETT REVIVAL". 
INT. THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 
A Keystone Kop short in progress. Bucky can barely sit down to watch... 
VOICE OVER I tried to keep calm. I told myself that just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't mean he had anything to do with a smut film twenty-five years later. 
And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient Egypt. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Duke Wellington had admitted making it. Linda Martin had said it was shot in Mexico. 
The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett. Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett Sprague" 
On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him: "Filmed in Hollywood, USA." 
EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER 
as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the Hollywood hill catching his attention. 
INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE 
Bucky at dinner with the Spragues. 
EMMETT SPRAGUE Mack Sennett? Helped him build that housing project he was putting up-- Hollywoodland-- 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
as Bucky stares up at the sign. 
INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT 
Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens - it's Russ Millard. 
RUSS MILLARD I got your message, Bucky. 
BUCKY Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I-- 
RUSS MILLARD It? 
Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room-- 
BUCKY Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's just... 
Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic. 
RUSS MILLARD Calm down, son. Tell me. 
Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins. 
INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him. 
VOICE OVER I told him everything. Me and Madeleine, the Spragues. Withholding evidence for her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of it he only had one thing to say: 
INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 
On Russ: 
RUSS MILLARD All right, then. It's your ball. What do you wanna do? 
BUCKY I want to search every fucking inch of every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague property if it takes the rest of my shitty career. And I know exactly where we start. 
INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT 
as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A" is taken dawn. 
VOICE OVER Between my time with Madeleine and the local boom baron expose in the papers, I was practically an expert on Emmett Sprague's land deals... 
EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE 
A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being torn down. 
Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into the woods. 
VOICE OVER (cont'd) For the first time since the beginning of the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to figure out who killed Elizabeth Short. Instead, I focused on where. 
EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT 
Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like two men consulting a treasure map in the woods. 
In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown out and the door hanging off its hinges. 
VOICE OVER And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't have to look any further than one of Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One that was isolated...abandoned... 
They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind. 
EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER 
Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it deeper into the night... 
VOICE OVER ...and most importantly, close to a water source...where one could drain a body of its blood. 
Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see 
THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW 
teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death leer. 
Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and step into the abandoned house.

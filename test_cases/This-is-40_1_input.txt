Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets. 
LARRY Did you miss me Travis? 
TRIPLET #1 It's Jack! 
LARRY Hey, Jack. 
TRIPLET #1 My daddy doesn't know my name. 
CHARLOTTE Can I go show them my crystals before they leave? 
DEBBIE Yeah, really quick. 
Charlotte leaves with the triplets. 
LARRY Go play with your tiny uncles. (to Debbie) So, what are you doing, spring cleaning? 
DEBBIE I'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar. 
LARRY Why? What's wrong with gluten? 
DEBBIE Gluten's really bad for you. 
LARRY I don't think so. It's wheat. 
DEBBIE Don't you watch Dr. Oz? 
LARRY As in the Wizard of? 
SADIE Hey, Mom. We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat. 
DEBBIE Remember the rules? Eight to eight- thirty? 
SADIE Yeah, but I have a friend over. 
DEBBIE Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go play? You could go build a fort! 
LARRY Remember the Alamo? 
DEBBIE Have you ever built a fort, Wendy? 
WENDY Like on Facebook? 
LARRY I will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters. 
DEBBIE But don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up? 
LARRY That's up to god, honey. 
DEBBIE But that's really not good for the kids. 
LARRY The kids eat grass. This is fine. 
Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out. 
SADIE Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants. 
WENDY My mom's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework. 
DEBBIE Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the cool one. But the rules are just different in our house. 
SADIE But I get better grades than Wendy. 
WENDY She does. She's so smart. 
LARRY Let me just grab the candy worms. 
SADIE Your rules are ridiculous. 
DEBBIE Don't sass me. 
SADIE I'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and I'm freaking starving. You're being stupid. 
DEBBIE Wendy, can you go stand in the other room, please? 
WENDY Yeah. 
Wendy exits. 
SADIE (whispers) Mom. 
DEBBIE Give me your iPhone now. 
LARRY The nougat things are good. 
SADIE I have all my contacts in there. 
DEBBIE Okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then I'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer. 
SADIE Jesus Christ-- 
DEBBIE That's it. 
SADIE I need my computer to do homework. 
DEBBIE No phone, no computer. 
SADIE This is B.S. This is a bunch of F- ing S. You're acting like a B. 
LARRY Kids! Time to go! 
DEBBIE You go to your room right now. 
Sadie runs off.

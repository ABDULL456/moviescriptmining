TY (thinking out loud) Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing- 
MACEO (O.S.) I think I fixed it good this time, Ty. 
Ty smiles- 
TY So he come out and plugs his ax in- 
MACEO He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back- 
TY Clothes, right- 
MACEO Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums- 
TY You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile? 
MACEO (smiles) And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter- 
TY They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they? 
MACEO Naw- it was his place that got robbed. 
TY Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show- 
MACEO They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted- 
TY And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they? 
Maceo begins to see where Ty is leading- 
MACEO Aw, no, Ty, we can't- 
Ty claps his hands together, jumps up and heads for the door- 
TY China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone! (to Maceo) Come on, man, we got work to do. 
CHINA DOLL Where you going, Daddy? 
TY I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam! 
52   INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE                                     52 We start on a portrait of Governor Big Jim Folsom on the wall, then TILT DOWN to Sheriff Pugh, feet up on the desk, a table-top FAN pointed at him, looking up at Ty- 
SHERIFF PUGH Why you interested in this boy? 
TY Got a job for him. 
SHERIFF PUGH Must be doin pretty good for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hirin new people on. 
TY Passing well, yeah- 
SHERIFF PUGH But this boy- 
TY Name is Sonny- 
SHERIFF PUGH He's payin off his debt to society right now, and if I was to pull him out of the field it would cost the county- 
TY Judge Gatlin payin three a day for prison labor. 
SHERIFF PUGH You gonna pay me four for the duration of his sentence? 
TY Which might be- ? 
SHERIFF PUGH -as long as I care to make it. 
TY Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal- if I could just rent him out for the weekend- 
SHERIFF PUGH Fifty dollars. 
Ty looks stricken- 
SHERIFF PUGH It's not just the money. There's legalistic principles involved here. Public safety issues- 
TY I pay you Sunday morning? 
SHERIFF PUGH You pay me now or you forget about it. 
TY I don't have it now.

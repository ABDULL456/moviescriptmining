{"train": "\"FRIDAY THE 13th\" \nFADE IN: \n1    EXT.  ROAD - DAY \nThe TRACK is SILENT. \nThe CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads: \nCAMP CRYSTAL LAKE Established 1935 \nGradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of CHILDREN playing. \nCUT TO: \n2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY \nIn the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying a game of softball. \nIn the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17 years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with \"Assistant Counsellor\" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well. \nFailing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks quickly in the opposite direction. \nThe CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we SUPERIMPOSE: \nJULY 4, 1958 \nThe CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly. \nCUT TO: \n3    EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY \nECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot. \nThe paper target is ripped in the black. \nThe COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the line. \nCLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG. \nCLAUDETTE Have you seen Barry? \nThe COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs. \nCOUNSELLOR He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time I saw him. \nCLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles. \nCUT TO: \n4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY \nTwo CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE. \nBARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE, and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out an Everly Brothers hit. \nBARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl. \nCLAUDETTE We've got to talk. \nBARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods. \nBARRY Okay. \n5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former. \nOIL MAN Climb on up, Miss. \nThe OIL MAN gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig. \nCUT TO: \n12    INT. OIL TRUCK - DAY \nAs the truck pulls away, we see RALPH through the windshield, standing at the edge of the road.  He is angry and upset now. He pats his rats. \nThe OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.  His two front teeth are missing on top. \nOIL MAN Must be the fourth time somebody's tried to reopen that place. \nANNIE Camp Crystal Lake? \nHe nods. \nOIL MAN Something always happens up there. \nHe turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again. \nDJ (V.O.) ...of bed.  I'm gonna count to three and then you better get up.  It's 7:24.  A beautiful day.  Weatherman Dr. Jim says it's gonna be a nine point five day. Here's Meatloaf from the Bat Out of Hell album. \nCUT TO: \n13    EXT. RURAL ROADS - DAY \nThe oil truck thunders along the road. \nCUT TO: \n14    EXT. RURAL CROSSROADS - DAY \nThe oil truck has stopped.  ANNIE stands alongside the driver's side. \nOIL MAN Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie. \nANNIE smiles. \nANNIE No sweat.  Thanks a lot for the lift. \nHe nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have been if he were thirty years younger.  He puts it in gear and roars off. \nANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.  It is closed. There's a sign which reads:  \"No Gas 'Til Sat.\"  A mangey dog sits on the stoop watching ANNIE. \nANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.  The dog comes.  ANNIE pets him and then heads off up the road. \nThe dog watches her go. \nCUT TO: \n15    EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.  It's hot and she's late. \nShe looks up. \nFrom her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us. \nANNIE puts out her numb. \nCUT TO: \n16    INT. JEEP - DAY \nFrom the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat. \nIn a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to escape. \nThe Jeep skids to a stop. \nCUT TO: \n25    EXT. ROADSIDE/WOODS - DAY \nThe CAMERA becomes the DRIVER and chases into the thicket. Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror- stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes past her in a blur. \nWhen the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise on ANNIE's face. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses out of FRAME. \nA bird soars across the sky above. \nThe TRACK is SILENT. \nCUT TO: \n26    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nA gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in- need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car. \nCUT TO: \n27    INT. CAMPER VAN - DAY \nIn the camper van are three young people.  They are full of fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake. They are instantly likeable. \nAt the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice- looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction. He is funny and alert. \nNext to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not as smart as NED.  He has to think things through. \nMARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders. \nShe is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by tragedy. \nMARCIE Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy. \nNED There you are dead wrong. \nJACK Ha! \nNED Sometimes I only think about kissing women. \nMARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back. \nJACK Ow! \nNED I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself. \nMARCIE You are a true pierce of work, Ned. \nMARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully. \nMARCIE (continuing) How about our last jay? \nJACK Good call. \nJACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a joint. \nNED What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter? \nJACK Quote:  Controlled substances are expressly forbidden.  Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal.  Unquote. \nMARCIE We got two weeks before the kids even arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly. Until then, hit me. \nSTEVE sets off. \nSTEVE I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks. \nAs soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE. \nNED I thought we had two weeks... \nALICE shrugs. \nALICE You can changed in three. \nCUT TO: \n33    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY \nThe CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing a coat of paint on the last canoe. \nBILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the trail. \nALICE Steve said for you to start on the boats. \nBILL I finished the boats. \nALICE nods slowly. \nALICE I'll tell him. \nShe turns away. \nBILL Alice?  The others show up? \nALICE Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen.  Annie. \nBILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps. \nALICE look at him, then turns again. \nBILL You think you're gonna last all summer? \nALICE I'm not sure I'll last all week. (pauses) I'll tell Steve. \nCUT TO: \n34    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - DAY \nSTEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking paint. \nSTEVE Shim it up just a scooch. \nNED levers the door higher at the top. \nSTEVE (continuing) Perfection.  Hold it. \nSTEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver. \nSTEVE (continuing) To answer your question, my parents once owned this camp.  There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt.  I promised them I'd reopen if I could. See if it closes right now. \nNED swings the door on its hinges. \nNED Looks good. \nSTEVE Perfection. Did you meet Brenda? \nBRENDA turns and nods. \nSTEVE (continuing) She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned. \nALICE I don't know.  Probably be best for everybody. \nSTEVE You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it ready.  Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful. \nHe puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek. \nShe looks up.  She nods. \nALICE Next Friday. \nSTEVE Thanks, Alice. \nHe stands up. \nSTEVE (continuing) I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten.  If you're still up, we can talk, okay? \nALICE Sure. \nShe watches him cross out of FRAME. \nCUT TO: \n38    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY (LATER) \nSTEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep. \nJACK You want it listed separately? \nSTEVE Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the archery range.  If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen.  Do your best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people. I'd like to look good. \nHe wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others stand looking before NED breaks the silence. \nNED He neglected to mention this place is called \"Camp Blood\" downtown. \nThey are all getting back to work. \nALICE How come? \nNED Some campers drowned.  Then some counsellors got killed. \nBILL No shit.  When? \nNED Late fifties sometime.  They never caught the guy who did it either. \nMARCIE Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake. \nAs they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE. \nCUT TO: \n39    EXT. ARCHERY RANGE - DAY \nBRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated. \nBRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far. The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job. \nThe CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target. \nIn MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by eighteen inches. \nBRENDA whips around. \nWE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean- to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair. \nShe grabs the arrow and storms at him. \nBRENDA You're crazy! \nALICE It's long and personal.  It has nothing to do with you or the other kids. \nBILL Maybe I can help? \nALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if naive, young man. \nALICE And it's this place.  It makes no sense, but it spooks me. \nBILL (smiling) You're right.  It makes no sense. \nAs ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside. \nCUT TO: \n43    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY \nMARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more or less for a frolic in the lake. \nBILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused. \nMARCIE Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal Lake.  Come on, Alice, I need protection! \nCUT TO: \n44    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY \nA LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull of a hot afternoon. \nAt the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no real attempt to exert too much energy. \nGradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held, on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight. \nBranches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally, we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush. \nCUT TO: \n45    EXT. WATER - DAY \nThe group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused on NED, who is acting as moderator. \nNED What do you want to be when you grow up? \nBRENDA Dancer. \nMARCIE Cowboy. \nNED Girls can't be cowboys. \nMARCIE Okay, Fireman. \nNED goes to JACK. \nNED Jack? \nJACK Coach, athletic director somewhere. \nBILL Filmmaker. \nALICE Artist. \nNED Doctor.  Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be? \nMARCIE Rocky Road. \nThey laugh. \nCUT TO: \nBILL gets up. \nBILL Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm ready.  Frozen yogurt? \nALICE smiles at the reference. \nALICE I'll be along. \nNED (in a nelly voice) Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out... \nThey head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front. \nCUT TO: \n50    EXT. FOREST - DAY \nA machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush. \nPULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration from his eyes and continues along. \nCUT TO: \n51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY \nSet up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement. \nECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He explodes his breath. \nWe PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt about his strength. \nBRENDA Not bad. \nAs NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take. \nNED Holy shit... \nBRENDA We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we? \nCUT TO: \n52    EXT. LAKE - DAY \nThe sun has dropped lower on the horizon. \nThe CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with a start. \nCUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete. \nALICE I didn't know I was asleep...What time is it? \nBILL Almost five. \nALICE gets up. \nALICE Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.  Steve is going to have a small cow. \nThey walk away from the shore. \nCUT TO: \n53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY \nALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it. \nBILL You can only do what you can do. \nALICE And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes--like you don't care about children... \nJACK turns to BILL. \nJACK Give me a hand? \nBILL For sure. \nCUT TO: \n61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON \nJACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is standing.  The puddle is somehow significant. \nBILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing. \nBILL This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine. \nJACK Here we go. \nThe CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates.  He bites down on it. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine roars into action. \nJACK (yelling) Now ya' close the switch. \nCU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a perfect connection running through his body.  There is a sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet shoes. \nBILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop- kick on his friend, severing the contact. \nJACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The machine stops. \nCUT TO: \n62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON \nJACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his breathing. \nJACK shakes his head. \nJACK I'll be okay.  Holy shit... \nBILL Don't get up.  Take a second... \nJACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm. \nJACK You saved my life. \nBILL I had to. \nJACK Thanks. \nBILL I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite. \nJACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet. \nJACK Whew. \nSatisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and looks in. \nWe can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred switch and a now-silent generator. \nBILL This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China. \nJACK looks in, too. \nJACK Floor probably leaks.  This area is full of springs. \nBILL A short somewhere. \nBILL                          BRENDA I don't want you getting      Melvin Belli. hurt. NED ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my I was careless.               guaranteed winner! \nBILL                          MARCIE How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli? \nALICE Somebody probably dropped something too hard. \nNED Alice, you're just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here. \nNEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back. \nMARCIE Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy. \nSuddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it. \nJACK What is it? \nBILL Is it stuck? \nNED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he writhes about. \nMARCIE                        ALICE Help him!                     Oh, my God! \nBILL                          JACK Roll him over!                Get behind him more. \nAs BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich, NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish: \nNED Ta-da! \nREACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on. \nJACK Not funny, Ned... \nBILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut. \nMARCIE Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens... \nNED But it's in the brochure!  \"Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program.\"  You just saw it. \nNED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE walks away.  JACK looks at BILL. \nBILL Chance to get even? \nJACK I'll spot you five points. \nNED Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it again. \nNED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him. The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting stunt. \nNED (continuing) I'm sorry. \nALICE Ned?  We're gonna be working together for a while.  You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay? \nNED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look at the others. \nNED Tell 'em I'm sorry? \nALICE nods. \nALICE Sure. \nNED I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's.  Today wiped me out. (pause) Thanks, Alice. \nALICE You're welcome. \nThe CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG, MARCIE speaks. \nMARCIE I hope that's the last time we see the Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program. \nMARCIE (continuing) What about Neddy? \nJACK I don't love Neddy. \nMARCIE He keeps on acting like such an asshole! \nJACK (yelling) Ned! \nMARCIE Don't call him. \nJACK I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know. \nMARCIE I guess... \nThe moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light. \nJACK Looks like a storm. \nMARCIE I'm a little scared of storms.  Always have been.  Since I was a kid. \nJACK You?  The brick? \nJACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie shadows.  She flashes hers at him. \nMARCIE I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can hear the sound.  I try to close my ears off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets louder.  The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers.  And the sound stops. \nA loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is startled and reaches out for her lover. \nJACK It's just a dream. \nMARCIE I call it my shower dream. \nThey look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them. \nJACK This is no dream.  Want to escape for a while? \nMARCIE Lead the way! \nJACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only a half step behind, laughing. \nFROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme, just the rumble of thunder... \nCUT TO: \n68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the nearest bed. \nMARCIE Are you wet? \nJACK Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman. \nHe reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points straight up and gives them some light to see by. \nThey go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses it at the CAMERA. \nCUT TO: \n69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT \nThe rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her. \nALICE Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched. \nBILL Not if they're where I think they are. \nALICE laughs. \n74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks to the row of showers and smiles. \nMARCIE Jack? \nThe screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut. \nMARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to scare her. \nMARCIE (continuing) Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on. \nThere is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower, hesitates. \nThrows back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off. \nShe goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain. \nMARCIE (continuing) Allee allee infree! \nShe throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there. \nShe breathes a sigh of disappointment. \nMARCIE (continuing) Must be my imagination. \nIn CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash. A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor. \nCUT TO: \n75    EXT. DINER - NIGHT \nThe sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS seated on stools at the counter. \nCUT TO: \n76    INT. DINER - NIGHT \nThe WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes. \nSANDY Anything else you want? \nSTEVE No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy. \nSANDY You can't go back there tonight.  Not in that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded. \nSTEVE (drinking quickly) I got to. \nSANDY Aw. \nSANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him. \nSTEVE I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word. \nSANDY They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain. \nHow much do I owe you? \nSANDY One night on the town. \nSTEVE I mean... \nSANDY ...I know what you mean.  Two and a quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone. \nSTEVE pays up and walks to the cash register. \nSANDY (continuing) You got a roof for that Jeep? \nShe rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a tip. \nLighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the road.  He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get rid of the condensation. \nFrom his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight dent in the night. \nIn the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical storm. \nSTEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio. \nCUT TO: \n83    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nALICE has finished her coffee.  BILL enters, shakes the rain off his poncho and stamps his feet. \nBILL Got to it just in time.  The generator was running on fumes.  I filled it up. That should keep it humming until Steve gets back. \nBRENDA gets up. \nBRENDA Good night, Alice. \nALICE Good night, Brenda. \nBRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her head like a portable tent, she races off into the night. \nALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as she heads off. \nBILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE. \nBILL Help you clean up? \nALICE Absolutely. \nShe walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups into the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n84    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like. \nBRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles. \nShe flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She stands up, and washes her hands and face. \nShe turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls, shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit. \nCUT TO: \n85    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nSTEVE's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls.  OVER we can hear him trying to re-start his dead engine.  R-r-r-r... \nCUT TO: \n86    INT. STEVE'S JEEP - NIGHT \nSTEVE angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter. R-r-r-r-rrr... nothing... \nHe looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view mirror. \nSTEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to flag down the oncoming car. \nCUT TO: \n87    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nSTEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has the window down already. \nBRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a match.  She fires up the propane lantern. \nBRENDA (continuing) Looks like I turn in early. \nShe moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear, revealing something that has been left there. \nREACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face. \nREVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood. \nBRENDA turns and runs from her room. \nCUT TO: \n93    EXT. PATHWAY/CAMP - NIGHT \nBRENDA runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched.  Her bare feet slip in the mud.  She heads for a small rise that leads to the softball field. \nCUT TO: \n94    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT of BRENDA running across the softball diamond. \nCUT TO: \n95    EXT. ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOX - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP:  a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit breaker. \nCUT TO: \n96    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP:  Two large spot lights on a telephone pole light up. \nCUT TO: \n97    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nThe softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks off behind the backstop.  Then to center field.  Confused, she runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds. Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then another. \nCUT TO: \n98    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nALICE is at one of the windows. \nALICE I don't here it anymore. \nBILL Can't hear anything through that wind and rain. \nALICE It sounded like Brenda. \nBILL I'll go take a look. \nALICE Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field? \nWe are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks. \nBILL Where? \nALICE They're off now. \nBILL heads for the door. \nBILL I'll go check on Brenda. \nBILL and ALICE have made their way to BRENDA's cabin.  From the outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table within. \nALICE Brenda?  Brenda?  You there? \nThere is no response.  The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin. \nCUT TO: \n102    INT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe SHOT continues on ALICE as she looks about the empty cabin. Finally she stops, looking down.  The CAMERA continues to hold on her face. \nALICE Bill. \nBILL crosses over to ALICE.  They are both looking down, past the CAMERA LENS. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE:  the bloody hatchet left on Brenda's pillow. \nANGLE on BILL and ALICE:  (as before).  Their faces are serious. \nALICE (continuing) What the fuck is going on here? \nCUT TO: \n103    EXT. JACK'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards Jack's cabin.  They go to the door.  BILL knocks. \nBILL Jack? \nALICE Marcie? \nBILL Hey, guys! \nBILL opens the door to the cabin. \nCUT TO: \n104    INT. JACK'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe door opens at us.  We see the silhouetted figures of BILL and ALICE.  BILL flips on the light switch. \nThe cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the contents neatly laid out. \nCUT TO: \n105    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark inside.  The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE make their way inside. \nALICE Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack? \nBILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers. \nALICE (continuing) I think we should call the police, Bill. \nBILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods and turns back to ALICE. \nBILL Okay. \nThey exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape passes between us and the night sky light which comes through the windows.  The shape is dragging something. \nCUT TO: \n106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT \nALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the left of the door is a small sign that reads:  \"Office.\"  BILL tries the door, but cannot open it. \nCUT TO: \n111    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA as PROWLER moves to the shed.  The noise of the generator grows louder as the door is opened. \nCUT TO: \n112    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nBILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG, ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front of her is a large machete. \nBILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts to doze again. \nThe bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out. \nBILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks it on. \nBILL Oh, shit.... \nHe goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong table. \nBILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits, carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp. \nHOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers. \nCUT TO: \n113    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT \nThe rain has lessened a bit.  BILL approaches the shed with his fluorescent lamp and rifle.  He has the rifle at the ready. \nCU on his hand on the door handle.  He pulls it open. \nCUT TO: \n114    INT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT \nThe generator stands there quietly.  BILL comes into view, spraying the interior with lamplight. \nIn the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately. It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer. \nBILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on. \nThen his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug. He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed. \nCUT TO: \n115    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid. \nALICE Bill?! \nShe gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light. \nShe sees the lanterns which have been placed around. \nALICE (continuing) The generator... \nNow that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern, and walks into the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n116    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee. \nMRS. VOORHEES (continuing) I couldn't let them start this camp again, could I? \nALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace poker. \nALICE I won't let you! \nALICE swings the poker back and forth. \nALICE (continuing) No!  No!  No! \nMRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife. ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib cage. \nMRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage. \nALICE drops the poker to run for the door. \nMRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE deliberately. \nLightning goes off followed quickly by thunder. \nCUT TO: \n123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT \nALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of the screen... somebody has latched it. \nCLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at the door, snapping the latch. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road. \nTWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart. \nREACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree. \nSTROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance between herself and ALICE. \nCUT TO: \n124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT \nALICE runs for the door, slams through it. \nThe CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear. \nCUT TO: \n125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT \nMRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly. \nCUT TO: \n126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT \nALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on. \nALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place. \nShe looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it, then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few feet. \nShe carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her. \nThe next drawer has a lock and hasp on it. \nALICE looks around. \nCUT TO: \n130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT \nMRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night. \nCUT TO: \n131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT \nANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She turns. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway, blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES steps slowly toward ALICE. \nALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and, swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall. \nMRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and drops to the floor. \nALICE runs out the door. \nCUT TO: \n132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT \nALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs into the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT \nALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide. She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and then hides there, closing the door behind her. \nCUT TO: \n134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT \nThere is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices. ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side. \nALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside. \nAs soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam. Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are turned on. \nJASON (V.O.) Please kill her, mommy... Help me, please.  Kill her, mommy. \nThere is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the sound of another door being slammed. \nALICE relaxes again. \nThen there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the idea. \nShe cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc. \nALICE covers her head with her arms. \nThe doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested. \nThe voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song. \nJASON (O.S.) Come out, come out, wherever you are... \nALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room. \nFists bang in a rage on the floor. \n", "test1_input": "Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It swells.  Closer. \nQUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the perspiration streaking their flushed skin. \nSuddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror. \nA hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the blow. \nThe CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away. \nANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree. \nA hunting knife soars against the leafy sky. \nBARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to the mossy floor of the clearing. \nTwo hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it. \nThere is a confused jumble of struggle. \nOnto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER. \nREACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight. \nThe PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward. We can hear the blade strike. \nBARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek. \nMCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME. \nQUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors. She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC has stopped abruptly. \nTHE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE. \nIt is completely SILENT. \nCUT TO: \n8    TITLE SEQUENCE \nThe screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black. \nThe THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement. \nTITLES END and the MUSIC fades out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n9    EXT. RURAL TOWN - EARLY MORNING \nThe TRACK is SILENT. \nIn a LONG SHOT we see the one main street.  A newspaper delivery truck drives away from the CAMERA.  A GIRL walks down the street. \nSuperimposed title: \nTHE PRESENT \nA MEDIUM SHOT in front of the bank reveals a day/date/time/temp sign which blinks: \nFRIDAY, 13 \n60 Degrees \nFRIDAY, 13 \n60 Degrees \n", "test1_true": "DJ (V.O.) It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June. This is Big Dave and it's time for you lazy bones to GET OUT OF BED!  It's black cat day in Crystal Lake.  Don't forget the big drawing today to see who gets our FRIDAY THE 13TH Monster Surprise: either a man's digital continuous readout watch or a Panasonic color television set! \nCUT TO: \n10    INT. DINER - MORNING \nIn CU a hand moves to turn down an old brown plastic radio from which Big Dave is doing his morning-man routine. \nDJ (V.O.) Don't walk under a ladder!  Don't spill any salt, don't... \nThe radio is turned way down.  We see that the hand belongs to TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with a pencil stuck in it.  BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG working the grill. \nThe regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery man, the switchboard operators, and the cop. \nANNIE walks in the front door, crosses the past the cash register and walks down the counter. \nSALESMAN I'm sick of them repeats. \nTRUDY I musta seen that Kojak 82 times. \nANNIE Excuse me.  How far is Camp Crystal Lake? \nSALESMAN                      OPERATOR They gonna open that place    Camp Blood? again? TRUDY COP                   What is it, Eddie?

Lotsa luck. \nSALESMAN (with a wink) Be an interesting summer. \nANNIE Can I get a bus or something? \nTRUDY Not likely.  Sam?  You goin' out to the crossroads? \nThe OIL MAN nods. \nTRUDY (continuing) Give her a lift?  That's hallway. \nOIL MAN (paying up) No sweat, Trudy.  Let's do it to it, kid. \nANNIE Name's Annie. \nOIL MAN Okay, Annie.  Let's go. \nANNIE steps aside as the OIL MAN heads for the front door.  He is smirking.  He's fifty, strong, and balding.  He makes no attempts to hide his appreciation for ANNIE's figure. \nThey exits. \nTRUDY I wouldn't send my kids to that camp for all the tea in China. \nSALESMAN (kidding) I thought you hated your kids. \nTRUDY looks around, does a take, then laughs. \nCUT TO: \n11    EXT. TOWN STREET - MORNING \nANNIE walks a half step behind the OIL MAN, heading for his truck which is parked there on the street. \nOIL MAN All the girls up there gonna look as good as you? \nANNIE I don't know. \nANNIE wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy. Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth; they swing from him like a strange beard. \nOIL MAN Goddamnit, Ralph!  Get outta here. (to ANNIE) Don't worry about him.  He's harmless. (back to Ralph) G'won.  Git! \nRALPH It's Friday the 13th. \nHe giggles and skulks away. \n", "test1_id": 495, "test2_input": "BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to ALICE's cabin. \nMARCIE and JACK follow in the BG. \nCUT TO: \n58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY \nALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and get her. \nBILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks at ALICE. \nALICE (a tight whisper) There's a fucking snake in here. \nBILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward. Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto the floor. \nMARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon. MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further to see the blood and guts. \nMARCIE Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack, would you get some paper towels? \nJACK nods and exits. \nALICE How the... did he get in there? \nBILL Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of your perfume. \nJACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE. \nMARCIE Thanks. \nBILL You okay now? \nALICE nods. \nBILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly, stepping on MARCIE's big toe. \nMARCIE Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time. (to JACK) Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here? \nJACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets underneath the wide-fanged snake. \nMARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper toweling. \nCUT TO: \n59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON \nLooking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt. \nCUT TO: \n60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and some windows which look out on the rear. \nBRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian. MARCIE is making a guacamole dip. \nIn the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table. JACK and BILL are playing. \nBRENDA                        JACK She all right?                Get ready for the schneider. \nMARCIE                        BILL Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance. of her. JACK BRENDA                Four zip. How'd it get in the drawer? \nALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the kitchen. \nMARCIE How you doin'? \nALICE Okay.  Can I help? \n", "test2_true": "MARCIE There's a lot of dishes if you just want something to do. \nALICE smiles.  Nods. \nALICE The way I feel, that's perfect. \nALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the dirty dish pan. \nNED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and pieces of old Indian costumery.  He does a bad dance. \nJACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway. \nJACK                          BILL What the hell?                Where'd you get that stuff? \nMARCIE                        BRENDA Oh, Lord!                     Neddy! \nJACK It's gonna be a long summer. \nNED Wait, wait!   When I was finding these goodies in the shed.  I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen. \nHe takes a letter out of his breechclout.  He pretends to read, when really we can see that the paper is blank. \nNED (improvising) Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor's body... \nALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty girl, younger than she first appeared. \nNED (continuing) And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor. He says that whenever I'm scared, I can sleep in his bunk with him. \nJACK and BILL laugh. \nNED takes off his headdress. \nNED (continuing) No wonder they lost America.  How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that?  What's to eat? \nBRENDA Whatever you make yourself. \nALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side. Does she sees something? \nThe CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder. \nThe window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it stands, doesn't move... Is it a building? \nCUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass. When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone. \nREACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill... \nALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about food. \nBRENDA                        JACK How can you eat that stuff?   You like them rare? Looks like dead animals. BILL NED                   Too bad that Annie never Cannibals.  It's old          showed.

Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room. \nThe bulb does not light. \nALICE pulls it again. \nBILL Trouble? \nALICE Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a little gloomy in here. \nJACK Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator.  The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty. \nNED God, but I love that macho talk!

It is not there. \nALICE The knife! \nShe gets down on her hands and knees to look for it. \nLOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the couch. \nALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the lamp. \nJust as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass, shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE. \nIt is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced. \nALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door. \nALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited figure. \nALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp. \nWhen ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking. This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently, pointing back to the rear window. \nMRS. VOORHEES There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't help you if you can't talk to me. There, there now... \nALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room. \nMRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible. \nALICE He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God... \nMRS. VOORHEES It will be all right.  I'll take care of you. \nALICE Jack?  Marcie?  Ned? \nMRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm. \nMRS. VOORHEES It's just this place.  The storm. That's why you're all upset. \nALICE No, no, they're all dead... \nALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table without looking. \nMRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs. \nMRS. VOORHEES I'll go look. \nALICE's face registers the new terror. \nALICE They'll kill you!  Don't leave me! \nMRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly. \nMRS. VOORHEES I'm not afraid. \nALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to the back window. \nALICE All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie... \nALICE stands close to the fireplace. \nMRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked. \nMRS. VOORHEES Oh, my lord... \nMRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table, she picks up the lantern. \nALICE waits at the fireplace. \n", "test3_true": "ALICE Bill--Bill--Bill is out there... \nShe lets MRS.

VOORHEES looks around the room. \nMRS. VOORHEES (continuing) Oh, this place... It should never have been a camp.  Not for children.  They had so much trouble here. \nThe fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks. \nMRS. VOORHEES (continuing) Camp Blood. \nMRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down. Strokes her soft hair. \nMRS. VOORHEES (continuing) You know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed?  An accident?  It was inadequate supervision. The counsellors were not paying enough attention... They were making love when that boy drowned. \nALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger! \nThe THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light. \nMRS. VOORHEES (continuing) We should go now. \nALICE Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy. \nMRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently. \nMRS. VOORHEES No.  That won't be necessary. \nAs she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting knife. \nALICE I don't understand. \nMIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957. \nJASON (V.O.) (filtered) Help me, mommy... save me... please, mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy... save me.... \nMRS. VOORHEES (cocking her hand to listen) I am, Jason.  I am. \nALICE (a little confused) Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy? \nMRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with the visibility of her weapon. \nMRS.

Frozen yogurt? \nALICE smiles at the reference. \nALICE I'll be along. \nNED (in a nelly voice) Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out... \nThey head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front. \nCUT TO: \n50    EXT. FOREST - DAY \nA machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush. \nPULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration from his eyes and continues along. \nCUT TO: \n51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY \nSet up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement. \nECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He explodes his breath. \nWe PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt about his strength. \nBRENDA Not bad. \nAs NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take. \nNED Holy shit... \nBRENDA We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we? \nCUT TO: \n52    EXT. LAKE - DAY \nThe sun has dropped lower on the horizon. \nThe CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with a start. \nCUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete. \nALICE I didn't know I was asleep...What time is it? \nBILL Almost five. \nALICE gets up. \nALICE Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.  Steve is going to have a small cow. \nThey walk away from the shore. \nCUT TO: \n53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY \nALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it. \nBILL You can only do what you can do. \nALICE And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes--like you don't care about children... \n", "test1_true": "ALICE (continuing) I'll see you later. \nShe turns to go up the steps to her front door. \nBILL Alice? \nShe stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares. \nALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it wasn't easy for BILL to say. \nALICE You're very nice. \nThey share a short silent moment. \nBILL Hope you will. \nBILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long blade. \nALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin. \nCUT TO: \n54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY \nIn the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere. \nALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her. \nThe room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side. \nALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier.  She smiles at herself. \nShe reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel. \nALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe. \nShe closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door. \nCUT TO: \n55    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY \nALICE heads from her cabin to the showers. \nCUT TO: \n56    INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY \nALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down. \nShe hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there. \nOpens the next drawer.  Nothing there. \nOpens the next drawer.  Nothing there. \nALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack. \nThere is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away. Her scream is loud. \nCUT TO: \n57    EXT. MAIN CABIN - DAY \nBILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears ALICE. \nALICE (O.S.) Help! \n", "test1_id": 495, "test2_input": "Lighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the road.  He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get rid of the condensation. \nFrom his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight dent in the night. \nIn the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical storm. \nSTEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio. \nCUT TO: \n83    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nALICE has finished her coffee.  BILL enters, shakes the rain off his poncho and stamps his feet. \nBILL Got to it just in time.  The generator was running on fumes.  I filled it up. That should keep it humming until Steve gets back. \nBRENDA gets up. \nBRENDA Good night, Alice. \nALICE Good night, Brenda. \nBRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her head like a portable tent, she races off into the night. \nALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as she heads off. \nBILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE. \nBILL Help you clean up? \nALICE Absolutely. \nShe walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups into the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n84    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like. \nBRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles. \nShe flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She stands up, and washes her hands and face. \nShe turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls, shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit. \nCUT TO: \n85    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nSTEVE's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls.  OVER we can hear him trying to re-start his dead engine.  R-r-r-r... \nCUT TO: \n86    INT. STEVE'S JEEP - NIGHT \nSTEVE angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter. R-r-r-r-rrr... nothing... \nHe looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view mirror. \nSTEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to flag down the oncoming car. \nCUT TO: \n87    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nSTEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has the window down already. \n", "test2_true": "STEVE I think water got into the electrical system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll get one of my counsellors to drive me back tomorrow morning. \nTIERNEY Why not? \nSTEVE is around the car and hopping in almost before TIERNEY can answer. \nTIERNEY (continuing) \"To serve and protect\" don't mean to chauffeur. \nHe puts the car in gear and roars into the night. \nCUT TO: \n88    INT. GIRL'S CABIN/COUNSELLOR'S SECTION - NIGHT \nUnder a single hanging lightbulb, BRENDA finishes writing at a small table. \nThe weather howls outside.  There's a tapping sound.  BRENDA looks up.  Listens, yawns, then gets up and starts to take off her clothes. \nCUT TO: \n89    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThrough her window we can see BRENDA changing into her soft yellow pajamas. \nCUT TO: \n90    INT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe tapping returns. \nBRENDA That could drive a person bug-city. \nThe SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin; perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet. \nBRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out. \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the front door. \nCUT TO: \n91    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThere is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some protection from the wind and wet. \nANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound closer by.  She looks and sees. \nWE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows, making the knife tap against the building. \nBRENDA Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy! \nShe grabs the knife, breaking the string. \nBRENDA (continuing) This isn't even half funny. \nAngry, BRENDA turns and goes back inside the cabin. \nCUT TO: \n92    INT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \nBRENDA comes in shaking off her slicker, carrying the knife. \nBRENDA Christ, what a jerk. \nThe single bulb goes out. \nBRENDA (continuing) Great.  Now what? \n", "test2_id": 496, "test3_input": "BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a match.  She fires up the propane lantern. \nBRENDA (continuing) Looks like I turn in early. \nShe moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear, revealing something that has been left there. \nREACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face. \nREVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood. \nBRENDA turns and runs from her room. \nCUT TO: \n93    EXT. PATHWAY/CAMP - NIGHT \nBRENDA runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched.  Her bare feet slip in the mud.  She heads for a small rise that leads to the softball field. \nCUT TO: \n94    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT of BRENDA running across the softball diamond. \nCUT TO: \n95    EXT. ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOX - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP:  a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit breaker. \nCUT TO: \n96    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP:  Two large spot lights on a telephone pole light up. \nCUT TO: \n97    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nThe softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks off behind the backstop.  Then to center field.  Confused, she runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds. Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then another. \nCUT TO: \n98    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nALICE is at one of the windows. \nALICE I don't here it anymore. \nBILL Can't hear anything through that wind and rain. \nALICE It sounded like Brenda. \nBILL I'll go take a look. \nALICE Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field? \nWe are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks. \nBILL Where? \nALICE They're off now. \nBILL heads for the door. \nBILL I'll go check on Brenda. \n", "test3_true": "ALICE turns.  BILL is halfway out the door. \nALICE (continuing) I'll go with you. \nBILL shrugs. \nBILL If it'll make you feel better. \nCUT TO: \n99    INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe rain continues as they drive along. \nTIERNEY Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th.  They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon.  It affects people.  Makes 'em nuts. \nSTEVE You've made a science out of coincidence. \nThe police radio, which has been on \"squelch,\" comes on. \nDISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, Report. \nDISPATCHER #2 (V.O.) (filtered) Need a clear frequency... \nDISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, car niner. \nTIERNEY takes the mike. \nTIERNEY This is Tierney. \nDISPATCHER #2 (V.O.) (filtered) Rescue squad with jaws of life... near mile marker 17... possible fatals... three, maybe more... head on... at least one trapped... \nDISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) Sgt. Tierney, there's a bad accident. One fatality known, several possibles near mile marker 17 on the Interstate. Bus, tractor trailer.  Over. \nTIERNEY Roger.  Acknowledge receipt.  Estimate arrival time fifteen minutes.  How copy? \nTIERNEY has jammed on his brakes and swung the car around. \nDISPATCHER #1 (V.O.) (filtered) 100%.  I'll tell 'em you'll be there in fifteen minutes.  Out. \nTIERNEY bangs the mike down on the holder.  He stops the car. \nTIERNEY Have to drop you here, Steve. \nSTEVE Sure. \nSTEVE gets out quickly. \nSTEVE (continuing) Good luck. \nTIERNEY Another coincidence. \nSTEVE Yeah. \nCUT TO: \n100    EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nSTEVE turns as the cop's car door slams.  TIERNEY peels out on the wet road. \nCU as STEVE watches the lights grow dim in the distance. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as STEVE turns and jogs the other way.  Low thunder rolls in the distance. \nCUT TO: \n101    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 497}

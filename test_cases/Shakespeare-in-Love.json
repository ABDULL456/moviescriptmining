{"train": "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE \nby Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY. \nSKY. Over which a title \"LONDON--SUMMER 1593\" appears. Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem... \n...The Rose... \nGradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three- tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It says: \nSEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON \nMR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE THEATRE, BANKSIDE \nTHE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D \nOVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams are coming from the curtained stage. \nVOICE (O.S.) You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it is I who am bitten? \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nThe theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper. \nFENNYMAN What am I, Mr. Lambert? \nLAMBERT Bitten, Mr. Fennyman. \nFENNYMAN How badly bitten, Mr. Frees? \nFREES Twelve pounds, one shilling and four pence, Mr. Fennyman, including interest. \nHENSLOWE Aaagh! I can pay you! \nFENNYMAN When? \nHENSLOWE Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake. \nFENNYMAN Take his feet out. Where will you get \nFREES (the mathematical genius with a notebook) Sixteen pounds, five shillings and nine pence \nFENNYMAN including interest in three weeks? \nHENSLOWE I have a wonderful new play! \nFENNYMAN Put his feet in. \nHENSLOWE It's a comedy. \nFENNYMAN Cut his nose off. \nHENSLOWE A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare! \nFENNYMAN And his ears. \nHENSLOWE And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman! \nFENNYMAN (hesitating) Partners! \nHENSLOWE It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant. \nLAMBERT I think I've seen it. I didn't like it. \nHENSLOWE This time it is by Shakespeare. \nFENNYMAN What's the title? \nHENSLOWE Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. \nFENNYMAN Good title. \nFENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract. \nFENNYMAN (CONT'D) A play takes time. Find actors rehearsals\u0085let's say open in three weeks. That's--what--five hundred groundlings at tuppence each, in addition four hundred groundlings tuppence each, in addition four hundred backsides at three pence--a penny extra for a cushion, call it two hundred cushions, say two performance for safety how much is that Mr. Frees? \nFREES Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman. \nFENNYMAN Correct! \nWILL turns down a side street. \nEXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY. \nHENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone who will listen. \nMAKEPEACE and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on both their houses! \nAs he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note. \nEXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a doorway. \nHENSLOWE Where are you going? \nWILL To my weekly confession. \nAs HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled. \nINT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY \nA stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed degrees hang on the walls. \nWILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed \nDR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass. \nWILL Words, words, words\u0085once, I had the gift\u0085I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones\u0085for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery\u0085but now \nDR. MOTH And yet you tell me you lie with women? \nWILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his notes. \nDR. MOTH (CONT'D) Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and \nWILL (interrupting) Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift. \nDR. MOTH I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words. \nWILL I have lost my gift. (not finding this easy) It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. \nDR. MOTH Interesting. \nWILL Nothing comes. \nDR. MOTH Most interesting. \nWILL It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. \nDR. MOTH (shrewdly) Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love? \nWILL turns towards him. How did he know that? \nDR. MOTH (CONT'D) How long has it been? \nWILL A goodly length in times past, but lately \nDR. MOTH No, no. You have a wife, children \nThe sand runs through the hourglass. \nLATER Not much sand left. \nWILL I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again. \nDR. MOTH A woman of property? \nWILL (shrugs) She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so \nDR. MOTH And your relations? \nWILL On my mother's side the Ardens \nDR. MOTH No, your marriage bed. \nWILL Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. \nDR. MOTH So now you are free to love \nWILL yet cannot love nor write it. \nBURBAGE The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us. \nHENSLOWE And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you? \nBURBAGE Ask him. \nThe Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the curtain officiously. \nTILNEY She comes! \nHe disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and find places to peep through. \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF HOUSE/STAGE. DAY. \nTHE POV OF THE PLAYERS. \nThe arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. \nClose on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing \"W. Shakespeare.\" WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips it into the mouth of the snake bangle. \nThe curtain draws back and CONDELL as \"VALENTINE\" and BURBAGE as \"PROTEUS\" begin the play. \nCONDELL AS VALENTINE \"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits\u0085\" \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nWith BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. After a moment, WILL pulls back. \nROSALINE When will you write me a sonnet, Will? \nWILL I have lost my gift. \nROSALINE You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again. \nWILL Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? \nROSALINE Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart. \nWILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the auditorium. \nWILL You see? The consumptives plot against me. \"Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it.\" \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY. \n\"VALENTINE\" is on stage with \"PROTEUS.\" \nCONDELL AS VALENTINE \n\"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights\u0085\" \nAs the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE. \nWILL I feel a scene coming on. \nHENSLOWE Is it about a pirate's daughter? \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE. DAY. \nLaughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his dog. The audience is roaring. \nHENSLOWE You see? Comedy. \nQUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the others. \nQUEEN Well played, Master Crab, I commend you. \nShe throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it down. Everyone applauds. \nHENSLOWE Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like. \nNow we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE. \nElsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed VIOLA. The nurse notices him. \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF HOUSE/STAGE. DAY. \nLATER. \"VALENTINE\" is on stage alone. He is speaking the speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear later. \nCONDELL AS VALENTINE \"What light is light if Silvia be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection\u0085\" \nNow we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is silently mouthing it with the actor. \nMESSENGER The theatres are reopened. By order of the Master of the Revels, the theatres are reopened \nFENNYMAN is intrigued. \nFREES Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened the playhouses. \nFENNYMAN Yes I heard. \nHENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly, shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip. \nHENSLOWE (to LAMBERT) If you wouldn't mind \nHENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE, curious. \nFENNYMAN Where is the play? \nHENSLOWE Oh, it's coming, it's coming. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY. \nIt is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is still alight, although it is day outside the window. He has been writing all night. He has written about ten pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them up and leaves the room like a man with a mission. \nEXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY. \nLeaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down HENSLOWE who has come to see him. \nHENSLOWE Will! The theatres are \nBefore he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his hand. \nWILL Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! \nHENSLOWE Rosaline? You mean Ethel. \nWILL has gone. \nEXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. \nBURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs through the door without ceremony. \nWILL (shouting) Richard! \nINT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL enters and calls out. \nWILL Burbage? \nINT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY. \nWILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is shattered. \nWILL Mr. Tilney \nThe unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from ROSALINE'S arm. \nTILNEY Like you, I found him not at home! \nWILL So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. \nROSALINE Will! \nWILL (to ROSALINE) I would have made you immortal. (turning to go) Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare. \nTILNEY What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe. \nWILL You have opened the playhouses? \nTILNEY I have, Master Shakespeare. \nWILL But the plague \nTILNEY (sighs) Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house. \nA bell can be heard ringing outside. \nROSALINE (to WILL, leaving) Will\u0085you're the only one, Will!--in my heart. \nEXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He watches for a moment as the pages catch fire. \nWILL Do you think? \nMARLOWE The daughter of his enemy. \nWILL (thoughtfully) The daughter of his enemy. \nMARLOWE His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio. \nWILL Mercutio\u0085good name. \nNOL hurries back to WILL'S side. \nNOL Will--they're waiting for you! \nWILL I'm coming. \nHe drains his glass. \nWILL (CONT'D) Good luck with yours, Kit. \nMARLOWE I thought your play was for Burbage. \nWILL This is a different one. \nMARLOWE (trying to work it out) A different one you haven't written? \nWILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nHENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning. \nYOUNG ACTOR \" \u0085Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!\" \nHENSLOWE Thank you. \nHENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR. \nSECOND ACTOR I would like to give you something from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. \nHENSLOWE How refreshing. \nSECOND ACTOR \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\" \nHENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN. \nURCHIN \"\u0085the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a--?\" \nHENSLOWE (bellows) Thank you! \nThe URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad stutter. \nWABASH \"W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f- f-face\u0085\" \nHENSLOWE (unexpectedly) Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. Report to the property master. \nWILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) (apologetically) My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo? \nWILL I did not. \nHENSLOWE Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages? \nWILL Tomorrow \nHENSLOWE leaves him. \nWILL (CONT'D) (a prayer) please God. \nWILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR. \nACTOR May I begin, sir? \nWILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, with a hat shadowing his eyes. \nWILL Your name? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player. \nWILL can hardly manage a nod. \nHer mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE. \nLADY DE LESSEPS \nWhere is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled tonight. \nBehind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns. \nLADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D) Tomorrow he drags me off to the country and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our estates. \nA different door communicating to the next room, opens and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a robe. She curtseys to her mother. \nVIOLA God save you, mother. (to NURSE) Ho water, nurse. \nThe NURSE looks at her, round-eyed. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY. \nFrom a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S command. \nSCULLERY MAID (O.S.) Thomas Kent, sir? No sir. \nWILL (O.S.) The actor \nNURSE Who asks for him? \nWILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter. \nWILL William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and playwright of the Rose. \nThe NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work. \nNURSE Master Kent is\u0085my nephew. \nWILL (giving her the letter) I will wait. \nNURSE Much god may it do you. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING. \nVIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is adding hot water to the tub. \nVIOLA (delighted) He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. \nNURSE (unimpressed) Verona again. \nVIOLA (devouring the letter) A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King! \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. \nWILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and escapes a soaking. \nSERVANT Be off! \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nThe NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress. \nNURSE Your mother, and your father \nVIOLA (gaily) From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome? \nNURSE He looks well enough for a mountebank. \nVIOLA Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming. \nNURSE (firmly) My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell. \nVIOLA (twice as firmly) You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig! \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. \nWILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying instruments. WILL recognizes them. \nWILL Master Plum! What business here? \nMUSICIAN A five shilling business, Will. We play for the dancing. \nThe sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX skid to a halt and enter the house. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT. \nThe NURSE calls \"Madam!\" from inside the room. \nVIOLA Anon, good nurse. Anon. (to WILL) Master Shakespeare?! \nWILL The same, alas. \nVIOLA Oh but why \"alas?\" \nWILL A lowly player. \nVIOLA Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart. \nWILL Oh--I am him too! \nThe NURSE calls again. \nVIOLA (to NURSE) Anon, anon! (to WILL) I will come again. \nShe goes inside for a moment. \nWILL (to himself) Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be punished for this! \nVIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again. \nWILL (CONT'D) Oh my lady, my love! \nVIOLA If they find you here they will kill you. \nWILL You can bring them with a word. \nVIOLA Oh, not for the world! \nThe NURSE calls her again: \"Madam!\" \nVIOLA (CONT'D) Anon, nurse! \nBut she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops his head over the parapet and is face to face with the NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the tree. \nEXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. \nMale voice shout to each other inside the house, candle flames appear in different windows, the garden door is flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He could have written it better. \nINT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN. \nWILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen sheets. He is inspired. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nIt is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are looking through their pages. \nJOHN \"Draw if you be men! (to JAMES) Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\" \nNOL \"Part, fools, put up your swords.\" \nWILL is going around pumping hands and slapping shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him. \nHENSLOWE It starts well, and then it's all long- faced about some Rosaline. Where's the comedy, Will. Where's the dog? (to RALPH) Do you think it is funny? \nRALPH I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. That's funny \nWILL pulls HENSLOWE aside. \nWILL We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. \nHENSLOWE We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster. \nWILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, the URCHIN we met before. \nWILL Who are you, master? \nURCHIN I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter. \nWILL (furiously) I'll be damned if you are! \nAnd he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to face with FENNYMAN. \nFENNYMAN Is it going well? \nHENSLOWE Very well. \nFENNYMAN But nothing is happening. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nSAM is now \"JULIET.\" The play has evidently reached Act I Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of \"ROMEO\" and \"JULIET\" in a simplified version of the changing-partners dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge. \nALLEYN Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage! \nThe dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault. \nALLEYN (CONT'D) (furious) Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! Are you a lady, Mr. Kent? \nTHOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an argument. \nWILL (preempting) You did not like the speech? \nALLEYN The speech is excellent. (he does the first line impressively) \"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!\" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible. \nWILL points significantly at the pages he has given PETER. \nWILL There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: \"a plague on both your houses!\" \nNED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns back. \nALLEYN He dies? \nBut the author has escaped. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. \nUp aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the floor. That done, he picks up his pen. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nWILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern. \nBURBAGE Will! \nWILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls after him. \nBURBAGE (CONT'D) And where are my pages . . . \nWILL hurries on. \nEXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK. \nVIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From behind, in the direction of Bankside, \"he\" hears shouting. \nWILL (O.S. shouting) Did you give her my letter? \nVIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, following in another boat. She takes a letter from her coat and holds it aloft. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (calling) And this for you. \nEXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. \nWILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA. \nWILL Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. \nBOATMAN Writer, is he? \nWILL turns on him savagely \nWILL Row your boat. \nEXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. \nWILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore him. \nWILL She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS If you love her, you must do what she asks. \nWILL And break her heart and mine? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS It is only ours you can know. \nWILL She loves me, Thomas! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Does she say so? \nWILL No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? \nVIOLA (CONT'D) I do not know how to undress a man. \nWILL It is strange to me, too. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nThe NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks startled. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nWILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose end and spins her naked. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nThe NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE stares at the CHAMBERMAID. \nNURSE Go to, go to. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nWILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each other's arms. \nVIOLA I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. \nWILL There is. \nVIOLA Even your play. \nWILL (frowns) Oh \nVIOLA And that was only my first try. \nWILL Well perhaps better than my first. (he kisses her again) \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN. \nDawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with envious streaks. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN \nThe NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN. \nA rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his name and he kisses her. \nVIOLA Will \nThen he starts to get out of bed. \nVIOLA (CONT'D) You would not leave me? \nWILL I must. Look-- how pale the window. \nVIOLA (pulling him down) Moonlight! \nWILL No, the morning rooster woke me. \nVIOLA It was the owl--come to bed \nShe is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes around them. \nWILL (giving in) Oh, let Henslowe wait. \nVIOLA (pausing, pushing him away) Mr. Henslowe? \nWILL (persisting) Let him be damned for his pages! \nVIOLA Oh--no, no! \nWILL (kissing her) There is time. It is still dark. \nVIOLA It is broad day! (the rooster crows again) The rooster tells us so! \nWILL It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. \nHe kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She sits up and pulls on her gown. \nVIOLA You would leave us players without a scene to read today?! \nThere's a knock at the door. \nNOL AS BENVOLIO (to ROMEO) \"Away, be gone, the sport is at best.\" \nVIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the curtain at the gap. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. \nWILL is kissing her hand. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. \nVIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss, dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the general backstage area. \nSAM AS JULIET (O.S.) \"Come hither nurse. What is yond gentleman?\" \nVIOLA (to Will) Oh let it be night! \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nRALPH AS NURSE \"I know not.\" \nSAM AS JULIET \"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. \n\"JULIET'S\" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls away. \nVIOLA Oh, do not go \nWILL I must. I must \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nAs WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the rehearsal can be heard continuing. \nRALPH AS NURSE (O.S.) \"His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy.\" \nALLEYN (O.S.) (roaring from the audience) Terrible! \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. \nWILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all over the table. We take a peak at the lines he has already written. INSERT MANUSCRIPT: \"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun.\" VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line. \nVIOLA (VO) \"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!\" \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. \nVIOLA (reading) \"Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she\u0085\" \nVIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her. \nVIOLA (CONT'D) Oh, Will! \nWILL Yes, some of it is speakable. \nShe has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with the pages. \nVIOLA (continuing reading) \"It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nVIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in rehearsal, with SAM as \"JULIET\" sighing on the balcony above her. \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek. \nSAM AS JULIET (above) \"Ay me.\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"She speaks. \nOh speak again bright angel\u0085\" \nWe have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. \nWILL (reading through VIOLA'S kisses) \"Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name.\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nSAM AS JULIET \"Stay but a little, I will come again.\" \nSAM leaves the balcony through the curtain. \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Oh blessed blessed night.\" \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nIt is night. They have just made love. Suddenly it is very still. \nVIOLA (almost to herself) \"I am feared, \nBeing in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering- sweet to be substantial.\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nOnstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse) who has a couple of words \"of,\" as it were, in \"JULIET'S\" chamber. \nSAM AS JULIET (O.S.) \"\u0085All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\" \nRALPH AS NURSE \"Madam!\" \nSAM AS JULIET (O.S.) \"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--\" \nRALPH AS NURSE \"Madam!\" \nSAM AS JULIET (O.S.) By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!\" \nSAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain. \nSAM (to NED) I cannot move in this dress! and it makes me look like a pig! I have no neck in this pig dress! (and then hearing his cue from \"ROMEO\") Oh, she's off again! She says she's going and then she doesn't \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. \nNED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there, holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER. \nWILL (to PETER) How is it? \nPETER (shrugs) It's all right. \nTypical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the field to NED. WILL braces himself. \nWILL Ned\u0085I know\u0085I know \nALLEYN It's good. \nWILL Oh \nALLEYN The title won't do. \nWILL Ah \nALLEYN Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion. \nWILL Thank you, Ned. \nThe whole exchange is in ironic code, between old soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend. \nWILL (CONT'D) You are a gentleman. \nALLEYN And you are a Warwickshire shit-house. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nPETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the pages, he shakes his head. \nHENSLOWE (in disbelief) You mean, no dog of any kind? \nFENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE and looks daggers at him. \nPETER (to HENSLOWE) The Friar married them in secret, then Ned gets into a fight with one of the Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he gets in Ned's way, I mean in Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. Then the Prince banishes him from Verona. \nHENSLOWE (much relieved) That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King. \nFENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog, roars at HENSLOWE . \nFENNYMAN Cease your prattling! Get out! (to the stage where the action has paused) A thousand apologies! \nSAM AS JULIET \"Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\" \nThe way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the best chair\u0085where she establishes a headquarters. Her current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and bowing as they are greeted by people who know them\u0085Will, in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve. \nWESSEX (to him) Now? \nLORD IN WAITING Now. \nWESSEX (to Viola) The Queen asks for you. Answer well. \nThe LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm. \nWESSEX (CONT'D) Is there a man? \nWILL A man, my lord? \nWESSEX (impatiently) There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house? \nWILL A theatre poet? \nWESSEX An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house? \nWILL Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. \nWESSEX (venomously) That dog! \nANGLE on the QUEEN. \nThe LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks from a frozen curtsey. \nVIOLA Your Majesty. \nQUEEN Stand up straight, girl. \nVIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond. \nVIOLA (agreeing) Your Majesty. \nQUEEN What do you love so much? \nVIOLA Your Majesty \nQUEEN Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love? \nVIOLA I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed \nQUEEN (interrupting) They are not acted for you, they are acted for me. \nVIOLA remains silent, in apology. \nANGLE on WILL. \nHe is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN so close. He is fascinated. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) And--? \nVIOLA And I love poetry above all. \nQUEEN Above Lord Wessex? \nShe looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) (to WESSEX) My Lord--when you cannot find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse. \nThe COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true. \nVIOLA (blurts) Oh, but they can! \nShe has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched. \nVIOLA (CONT'D) I mean\u0085Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can \nWESSEX Lady Viola is\u0085young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune. \nQUEEN I thought you were here because you had none. \nTitters again. WESSEX could kill somebody. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) (by way of dismissing him) Well, no one will take your wager, it seems. \nNED comes out of character. \nALLEYN Are you going to do it like that? And before the humbled actor can reply NED continues. \nALLEYN (AS MECUTIO) And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something, make it a word and a blow. \nBut suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, and a bucket (containing pig swill). \nBURBAGE Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!? \nWILL has already leapt up onto the stage. \nWILL What is this rabble?! \nBURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, watches enthralled. \nFENNYMAN (to HENSLOWE) Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog! \nBut now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH \nHENSLOWE Not with my props! \nVIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow aimed at WILL \nVIOLA Will! What--? \nWILL A literary feud. Quite normal. \nThen he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space. \nWILL (CONT'D) Stay hid! \nHe gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, with SAM GOSSE, dressed as \"JULIET,\" fighting with the best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for Will to plummet down it. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY. \nWILL I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country. \nThey embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of their own. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY. \nThe battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells. \nHENSLOWE We need that for the balcony scene! \nFENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He looks around the realises that some of these faces are unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) (in despair) My poor Rose! \nHe collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that this scene is not in them. \nFENNYMAN (horrified) My investment! LAMBERT!!! \nLAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but wakes to his master's call. \nFENNYMAN (CONT'D) (points at the fray) VENGEANCE! \nHENSLOWE attempts to intervene. \nHENSLOWE I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business \nFENNYMAN Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business \nAnd he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is making short work of the rest of the opposition, receiving help with the thorny business of identification from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and bravos engulf him. A star! \nINT. BROTHEL. NIGHT. \nThe victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party. \nFENNYMAN (shouts) A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open and on the house! Oh what happy hour! (and grabbing a RADDLED WHORE) Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to yourself I'll not have you infecting my investment! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (looking around guardedly. To WILL) Is this a tavern? \nWILL It is also a tavern. \nWILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S knee and kisses him. \nPRETTY WHORE I remember you! The poet! \nVIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap. \nWILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on sheets folded to octavo size. \nWILL The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering. \nShe wants to accept the present with joy, but something in his mood restrains her. \nWILL (CONT'D) There's a new scene \nHe turns the pages and shows her. \nVIOLA Will you read it for me? \nWILL (he knows it) \"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\" \nVIOLA (reading) \"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\" \nThe words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their way of saying the farewells they cannot utter. \nWILL \"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer\u0085\" \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nBut the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as \"THOMAS.\" Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming away, their words interrupted by kisses. \nWILL \"\u0085thou need'st not to be gone.\" \nVIOLA \"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.\" \nBy now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness. \nAnd into this heaving composition comes a little white mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in the planking behind VIOLA'S head. \nAn adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S. \nWEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, thinking it out. \nEXT. ALLEWAY. DAY. \nTILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand. \nTILNEY You will go far, I fear. \nTILNEY (CONT'D) I hope we work together again. Tilney walks away. \nEXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY. \nA man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, for which he has a special voice. \nFENNYMAN \"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.\" Then him. Then me. \n\"Put this in any liquid thing you will And\u0085\"--something \nHe has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair. \nFENNYMAN (CONT'D) \"Such mortal drugs I have\u0085\" What is it? What is it? \nHe is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance dismounts and walks inside. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nOnstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actors\u0085and JOHN WEBSTER\u0085who sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him. \nWEBSTER My lord! \nWESSEX knocks him aside and continues. \nWESSEX (shouts) Shakespeare! \nEverything stops. \nWESSEX (CONT'D) You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell! \nWILL You are on my ground. \nWESSEX (drawing his sword) By God, I'll fight the lot of you \nWILL draws his sword. \nWILL I am more than enough. \nVIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the fight has started. \nHENSLOWE (in despair) It is over. \nVIOLA I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. (she turns to WILL) I am sorry, Will. \nWILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH \nWABASH Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w- wonderful. \nVIOLA Thank you. \nAs she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off towards her\u0085but his progress is halted by a sock to the jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or worse. FENNYMAN looks around. \nFENNYMAN Everything all right? \nEXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING. \nThe closure notice is nailed to the door. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nVIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Juliet\u0085and rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. \nShe looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be said. \nINT. TAVERN. DAY. \nThey are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat selfishly. \nFENNYMAN (muttering) I would have been good\u0085I would have been great. \nHe hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood. \nRALPH So would I. We both would. \nRALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes and bandages round their heads. \nFENNYMAN (shouts) Lambert! \nLAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and tables out of his way. \nFENNYMAN (CONT'D) Kill him! \nLAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a battle-axe. \nBut BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces BURBAGE. \nALLEYN Well, Burbage--you never did know when your scene was over. \nBURBAGE That can wait. The Master of the Revels despises us for vagrants, tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But my father, James Burbage, had the first licence to make a company of players from Her Majesty, and he drew from poets the literature of the age. Their fame will be our fame. So let them all know, we are men of parts. We are a brotherhood, and we will be a profession. Will Shakespeare has a play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is yours. \nEXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY. \nA strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at the poster. It says \nBY PERMISSION OF MR. BURBAGE A HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION OF MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION OF THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary \nWILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him: \nHENSLOWE Will! \nWILL does not turn to look at him. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) We'll be needing a Romeo \nWILL carries on walking. \nEXT. STREETS. DAY. \nWILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the river. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY. \nThe NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress. The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task impassively. \nEXT. THE RIVER. DAY. \nWILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY. \nWESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money chest, too. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nEverything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets and drums sound. The house falls silent. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY. \nWABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering lines and stuttering them. \nWABASH (mutter) T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike in d-d-d-dignity. \nWILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to him. \nWILL (to HENSLOWE) We are lost. \nHENSLOWE No, it will turn out well. \nWILL How will it? \nHENSLOWE I don't know, it's a mystery. \nAnd off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and sends him through the curtain. \nANGLE on WABASH \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nThe audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself. \nWABASH AS THE CHORUS T-t-t-t-two \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nWILL shuts his eyes and prays. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nWABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery like a star. \nWABASH AS THE CHORUS \"\u0085Household both alike in dignity (in fair Verona where we lay our scene) From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star- cross'd lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife\u0085\" \nEXT. STREET. DAY. \nVIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nHEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as \"SAMPSON\" and \"GROCERY,\" Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH comes through the curtain backstage. \nWILL (to WABASH) Wonderful! \nWABASH W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good? \nThe HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play begins. \nPOV: from THE WINGS: \nJOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON \"Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.\" \nJAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY \"No, for then we should be colliers.\" WILL looks as if he would rather be dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL, nervously. \nSAM (nervously--in a deep bass guttural hoarse voice) Master Shakespeare \nWILL (absently) Luck be with you, Sam. (as the awful truth gets through to him) Sam\u0085? \nSAM (in the same voice) It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday. \nWILL Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. \nSAM (the effect is horrible) \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\u0085\" \nHENSLOWE has been overhearing. \nHENSLOWE Another little problem. \nWILL What do we do now? \nHENSLOWE The show must \u0085 you know \nWILL Go on. \nHENSLOWE Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. \nHIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. \"THE PRINCE\" played by WABASH is having the last word. \nTHE PRINCE \"For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\" \nThe end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY. \nThe inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a play of their own\u0085embracing and kissing passionately, making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience and the penny drops. It's a hit. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY. \nThe audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S \"COPS\" ring the stage, facing inwards. \nTILNEY (shouts triumphantly) I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth! \nThe AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the audience onto the stage. \nBURBAGE Arrest who, Mr. Tilney? \nTILNEY Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt of the authority invested in me by her Majesty. \nBURBAGE Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have not opened it. \nTILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment. \nTILNEY (he points a \"j'accuse\" finger at VIOLA) That woman is a woman! \nThe entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The NURSE crosses herself. \nALLEYN What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?! \nHe points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance. \nTILNEY I'll see you all in the clink! In the same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth \nAnd an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts him. \nVOICE Mr. Tilney\u0085! \nIt is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft of sunlight hits her. \nQUEEN Have a care with my name, you will wear it out. \nThere is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN ELIZABETH takes the limelight. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) The Queen of England does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you. \nVIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow. \nQUEEN (CONT'D) Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from you, Maser Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here. \nVOICE He is, Ma'am. \nThe voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look inconspicuous. \nWESSEX (weakly) Your Majesty \nQUEEN There was a wager, I remember\u0085as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. (turning to WEBSTER) You are an eager boy. Did you like the play? \nWEBSTER I liked it when she stabbed herself, your Majesty. \nThe QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye. \nQUEEN Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to Greenwich, Come as yourself and we will speak some more. WILL bows deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The waves part for her. \nINT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY. \nThe QUEEN is bowed out through the doors. \nEXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY. \nA gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking place, including some of the actors crowding to see her off. WESSEX bows out of breath. \nWESSEX Your Majesty! \nQUEEN Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon? \nWESSEX Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end? \nVIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the other players. The QUEEN catches her eye. \n", "test1_input": "The URCHIN nods grimly. \nURCHIN I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives. \nWILL Oh. What is your name? \nURCHIN. John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty. \nBecause a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches the result with sober interest. \nURCHIN (CONT'D) Plenty of blood. That is the only writing. \nWILL backs away, unnerved by the boy. \nURCHIN (CONT'D) Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off. \nWILL I have to get back. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM.

Come, madam, let's away.\" \nOnstage \"MONTAGUE\" and \"LADY MONTAGUE\" make their exit. Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE. \nWILL Cut round him for now. \nHENSLOWE (not understanding) What? Who? \nWILL Romeo. \nHENSLOWE The one who came with your letter? \nWILL What? \nNOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.) \"Good morrow, cousin.\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.) \"Is the day so young?\" \nThe voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small mustache. \nNOL AS BENVOLIO \"But new struck nine.\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?\" \nNOL AS BENVOLIO It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Not having that which, having, makes them short.\" \nWILL Good \nNOL AS BENVOLIO \"In love?\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Out.\" \nNOL AS BENVOLIO \"Of love?\" \nVIOLA AS ROMEO \"Out of her favour where I am in love.\" \nWILL (interrupting) No, no, no\u0085Don't spend it all at once! \nThe rehearsal stops. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Yes, sir. \nWILL Do you understand me? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS No, sir. \nWILL He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? \nHENSLOWE Juliet? You mean Ethel. \nWILL (rounding on him) God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! (to THOMAS) What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (timidly--looking through his few sheets of paper) I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two. \n", "test1_true": "Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens, fascinated. So this is theatre! \nWILL (CONT'D) Go once more! \nNED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his manuscript. \nALLEYN Will\u0085Where is Mercutio? \nWILL (tapping his forehead) Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write. \nWILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking anxious. \nHENSLOWE A sonnet? You mean a play. \nWILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY. \nVIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house WESSEX can be heard ranting. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT. \nLORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing the brunt of his impatience. \nWESSEX Two hours at prayer! \nNURSE Lady Viola is pious, my lord. \nWESSEX Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance! \nNURSE It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord. \nWESSEX It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master. \nVIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has disappeared. \nWESSEX (CONT'D) My lady VIOLA. \nVIOLA Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. \nWESSEX I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege. \nVIOLA You flatter, my lord. \nWESSEX No. I have spoken to the Queen. (pause) Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command. \nVIOLA Do you intend to marry, my lord? \nWESSEX Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. (pause) You are allowed to show your pleasure. \nVIOLA I do not love you, my lord. \nWESSEX How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia. \nVIOLA Virginia?! \nWESSEX Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . . \nVIOLA But why me? \nWESSEX It was your eyes. No, your lips. \nHe kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA recoils, and slaps him. \nWESSEX (CONT'D) Will you defy your father and your Queen? \nVIOLA The Queen has consented? \nWESSEX She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. \nVIOLA (forced to submit) I will do my duty, my lord. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nShe is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table. We can read part of it. \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day\u0085\" \nNow we see what VIOLA is writing. \nINSERT: \"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a daughter's duty\u0085 \" \nShe sheds a romantic, unhappy tear. \n", "test1_id": 657, "test2_input": "EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT. \nWILL comes staggering out into the street. \nWILL It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me! \nHe falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water and garbage. He gets up and staggers on. \nEXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT. \nA church tower looms up in the night sky. \nINT. CHURCH. NIGHT. \nThis is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair. \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY. \nA lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive animal. \nRiding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA and greets her merrily. \nWESSEX You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding. \nVIOLA It is not my riding day, my lord. \nWESSEX Bless me, I thought it was a horse. \nVIOLA I am going to church. \nWESSEX (recomposing his features to solemnity) I understand of course. It is to be expected. \nVIOLA It is to be expected on a Sunday. \nWESSEX And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house. \nVIOLA (cannot take this in) Mourning? Who is dead, my lord? \nWESSEX Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing. \nVIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her. \nVIOLA (faintly) He is dead? \nWESSEX (cheerfully solemn) Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul \nVIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in distress. \nNURSE My lady\u0085my lady\u0085now is the time to show your breeding. \nINT. CHURCH. DAY. \nThe NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat and sits down next to her. \nAs they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE. \nANGLE on WILL. \nWILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. \nWESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to mumble. \nWESSEX Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ! \nNow VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally running in terror. \nWESSEX (CONT'D) (screaming) Spare me! \nThe CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is leaving. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nOutside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the church. She calls his name. \nVIOLA Will! \nHe does not answer. She runs after him. \nVIOLA (CONT'D) Oh, my love, I thought you were dead! \nShe claps him to her. They told each other for a moment then WILL pulls back. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. MEADOW. DAY. \nVIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among the buttercups and looks down at him. VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She has not yet revealed her feelings. \nWILL Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. \nVIOLA You never spoke so well of him. \nWILL He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. \nVIOLA You lie. \nWILL turns to look at her. \nVIOLA (CONT'D) You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed. \nWILL My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. \nVIOLA Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet. \nWILL I was the more deceived. \nVOILA Yes--you were deceived. For I never loved you till now. \nWILL Now? \nVIOLA (declaring herself) I love you, Will, beyond poetry. \nWILL Oh, my love (he kisses her) You ran from me before. \nVIOLA You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. \nWILL You cannot marry Wessex! \nVIOLA If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare. \nThey kiss again, passionately. \nWILL No\u0085no. \nVIOLA (through his kisses) But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified. \nAnd as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut to: \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nWILL (he is mid speech) For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished \nHe is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc. WILL'S mood is intense and focused. \nWILL (CONT'D) but the Friar who married Romeo and Juliet \nACTOR (EDWARD) Is that me. Will? \nWILL You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again. \nTHE COMPANY murmurs approval. \nWILL (CONT'D) I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. \nFENNYMAN That's me. \nWILL And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. \nHENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled. \nWILL (CONT'D) And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills herself. \nPAUSE. \nWILL is staring at VIOLA \nHENSLOWE Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles. \nFENNYMAN Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so. \nALLEYN (to WILL) Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene missing between marriage and death. \nWILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head. WILL looks at NED. \nINT.

The hurt cannot be much. \nALLEYN A MERCUTIO Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man.\" \nA roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are gathering in the sky. On stage \"MERCUTIO\" is in 'ROMEO'S\" arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And the audience is quiet and attentive. \nALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D) \"\u0085--Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arms.\" \nEXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE.

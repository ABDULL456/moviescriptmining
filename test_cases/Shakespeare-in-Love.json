{"test1_input": "WILL turns down a side street. \nEXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY. \nHENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone who will listen. \nMAKEPEACE and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on both their houses! \nAs he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note. \nEXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a doorway. \nHENSLOWE Where are you going? \nWILL To my weekly confession. \nAs HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled. \nINT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY \nA stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed degrees hang on the walls. \nWILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed \nDR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass. \nWILL Words, words, words\u0085once, I had the gift\u0085I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones\u0085for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery\u0085but now \nDR. MOTH And yet you tell me you lie with women? \nWILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his notes. \nDR. MOTH (CONT'D) Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and \nWILL (interrupting) Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift. \nDR. MOTH I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words. \nWILL I have lost my gift. (not finding this easy) It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. \nDR. MOTH Interesting. \nWILL Nothing comes. \nDR. MOTH Most interesting. \nWILL It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. \nDR. MOTH (shrewdly) Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love? \nWILL turns towards him. How did he know that? \nDR. MOTH (CONT'D) How long has it been? \nWILL A goodly length in times past, but lately \nDR. MOTH No, no. You have a wife, children \nThe sand runs through the hourglass. \nLATER Not much sand left. \nWILL I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again. \nDR. MOTH A woman of property? \nWILL (shrugs) She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so \nDR. MOTH And your relations? \nWILL On my mother's side the Ardens \nDR. MOTH No, your marriage bed. \nWILL Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. \nDR. MOTH So now you are free to love \nWILL yet cannot love nor write it. \n", "test1_true": "DR. MOTH Here is a bangle found in Psyche's temple on Olympus cheap at four pence. Write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake. \nWILL looks at the snake bangle in wonder. \nWILL Will it restore my gift? \nDR. MOTH The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week. \nHe holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it, and takes the bracelet. \nEXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him, and HENSLOWE follows. \nHENSLOWE Now where? Will? \nWILL To the Palace at Whitehall. \nINT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. \nWHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. \nRICHARD BURBAGE is to play \"PROTEUS.\" A BOY PLAYER will play \"SILVIA,\" and last minute improvements to his makeup etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. \"LAUNCE,\" one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL KEMPE. \"LAUNCE'S\" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull\u0085in other words he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage. \nWILL (approaching) Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You too, good Crab. \nKEMPE Crab is nervous. He has never played the Palace. When will you write me a tragedy, Will? I could do it. \nWILL No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it. \nWILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark- haired, sexual. \nBURBAGE (to ROSALINE) My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress Rosaline, where were my seamstress's eyes? \nBURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes over to greet WILL. \nBURBAGE (CONT'D) There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will? \nWILL I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. \nBURBAGE Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men? \nWILL When I have fifty pounds. \nROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S costume and helps him into them. \nBURBAGE Are you writing? \nWILL (nods somewhat defensively) A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful. \nBURBAGE What is the chief part? \nWILL Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover. \nBURBAGE The title? \nWILL Romeo \nBURBAGE I will play him. Bring it tomorrow. \nWILL It's for Henslowe. He paid me. \nBURBAGE How much? \nWILL Ten pounds. \nBURBAGE You're a liar. \nBURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on a waistband, over his corset. \nWILL I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. \nBURBAGE Ned is wrong for it. \nWILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching. \nBURBAGE (CONT'D) (to WILL) Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages. \nWILL Done. \nHENSLOWE (arriving) Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket. \n", "test1_id": 657, "test2_input": "WILL Do you think? \nMARLOWE The daughter of his enemy. \nWILL (thoughtfully) The daughter of his enemy. \nMARLOWE His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio. \nWILL Mercutio\u0085good name. \nNOL hurries back to WILL'S side. \nNOL Will--they're waiting for you! \nWILL I'm coming. \nHe drains his glass. \nWILL (CONT'D) Good luck with yours, Kit. \nMARLOWE I thought your play was for Burbage. \nWILL This is a different one. \nMARLOWE (trying to work it out) A different one you haven't written? \nWILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nHENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning. \nYOUNG ACTOR \" \u0085Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!\" \nHENSLOWE Thank you. \nHENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR. \nSECOND ACTOR I would like to give you something from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. \nHENSLOWE How refreshing. \nSECOND ACTOR \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\" \nHENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN. \nURCHIN \"\u0085the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a--?\" \nHENSLOWE (bellows) Thank you! \nThe URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad stutter. \nWABASH \"W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f- f-face\u0085\" \nHENSLOWE (unexpectedly) Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. Report to the property master. \nWILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) (apologetically) My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo? \nWILL I did not. \nHENSLOWE Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages? \nWILL Tomorrow \nHENSLOWE leaves him. \nWILL (CONT'D) (a prayer) please God. \nWILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR. \nACTOR May I begin, sir? \nWILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, with a hat shadowing his eyes. \nWILL Your name? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player. \nWILL can hardly manage a nod. \n", "test2_true": "It does not take four lines of \"VALENTINE'S\" speech to confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has found his \"ROMEO\". \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D) \" \u0085except I be by Silvia in the night, There is no music in the nightingale. Unless I look on Silvia in the day, There is no day for me to look upon.\" \nWILL interrupts \"him.\" \nWILL Take off your hat. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS My hat? \nWILL Where did you learn how to do that? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS I . . . \nWILL Wait there. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Are you Mr. Shakespeare? \nWILL Let me see you. Take off your hat. \nTHOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level. THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the stage, then backstage, then into the \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY. \nRETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general factotum who is a new character, PETER. \nACTOR What are we playing? \nNOL Where are the pages? \nWILL enters into the middle of this. \nWILL (shouts) Where's the boy? \nNOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly. \nWABASH B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg! \nThe street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights his way through the men to get to the door. \nEXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY. \nWILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank. \nEXT. THE RIVER. DAY. \nWhen WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a number of waiting \"taxis.\" WILL jumps into the nearest one and shouts at the \"Taxi Driver\" BOATMAN. \nWILL Follow that boat! \nBOATMAN Right you are, governor! \nWILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits facing him, rowing lustily. \nBOATMAN (CONT'D) I know your face. Are you an actor? \nWILL (oh God, here we go again) Yes. \nBOATMAN Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king. \nWILL Really? \nBOATMAN I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once. \nEXT. THE RIVER. DAY. \nLATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run toward the house. \nWILL Do you know that house? \nBOATMAN Sir Robert De Lesseps. \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY. \nWILL runs towards the house. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY. \nTHOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call her VIOLA again. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY. \n", "test2_id": 658, "test3_input": "INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. \nSAM is now \"JULIET.\" The play has evidently reached Act I Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of \"ROMEO\" and \"JULIET\" in a simplified version of the changing-partners dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge. \nALLEYN Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage! \nThe dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault. \nALLEYN (CONT'D) (furious) Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! Are you a lady, Mr. Kent? \nTHOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an argument. \nWILL (preempting) You did not like the speech? \nALLEYN The speech is excellent. (he does the first line impressively) \"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!\" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible. \nWILL points significantly at the pages he has given PETER. \nWILL There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: \"a plague on both your houses!\" \nNED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns back. \nALLEYN He dies? \nBut the author has escaped. \nINT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. \nUp aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the floor. That done, he picks up his pen. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nWILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern. \nBURBAGE Will! \nWILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls after him. \nBURBAGE (CONT'D) And where are my pages . . . \nWILL hurries on. \nEXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK. \nVIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From behind, in the direction of Bankside, \"he\" hears shouting. \nWILL (O.S. shouting) Did you give her my letter? \nVIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, following in another boat. She takes a letter from her coat and holds it aloft. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (calling) And this for you. \nEXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. \nWILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA. \nWILL Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. \nBOATMAN Writer, is he? \nWILL turns on him savagely \nWILL Row your boat. \nEXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. \nWILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore him. \nWILL She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS If you love her, you must do what she asks. \nWILL And break her heart and mine? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS It is only ours you can know. \nWILL She loves me, Thomas! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Does she say so? \nWILL No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? \n", "test3_true": "WILL Your aunt? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (catching up) Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will. \nWILL Like a sickness and its cure together. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. (collecting herself) Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful? \nWILL Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. \nHe is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but WILL belies his words. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS And her lips? \nWILL Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS And her voice? Like lark song? \nWILL Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. \nVIOLA AS THOMAS She sings too? \nWILL Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? \nVIOLA AS THOMAS (glinting) What of her bosom? \nWILL Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player? \nWILL (fervently) Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! \nVIOLA AS THOMAS But what of Lord Wessex? \nWILL For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! \nThe boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth and jumps out of the boat. \nVIOLA Oh, Will! \nShe throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the house. \nBOATMAN Thank you, my lady! \nWILL (stunned) Lady? \nBOATMAN Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child. \nWILL gets out of the boat. \nBOATMAN (CONT'D) (reaching under his seat) Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a writer myself. \nThe BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript. \nBOATMAN (CONT'D) It wouldn't take you long to read it, I expect you know all the booksellers \nBut WILL has gone. \nEXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT. \nWILL drops over the wall into the garden and without hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony. \nINT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nWILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by the door. They stare at each other across the room. \nWILL Can you love a fool? \nVIOLA Can you love a player? \nThey run together and fall into a passionate kiss. \nWILL (springs back) Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent. \nVIOLA Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare? \nWILL I am. \nVIOLA Then kiss me again for I am not mistook. \nThey run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA fumbles with his clothing, he with hers. \n", "test3_id": 659}

ALAN Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay. The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg. An eye doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies man. 
71   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 71 
Alan sails through the front door. His smile disappears. William is plopped on the living room couch. Shirt half unbuttoned. Smoking. He freezes mid-puff. 
ALAN William? 
WILLIAM Hey.   Alan. 
SOUND OF SHOWER AND COLETTE SINGING OFF-KEY echoes throughout the house. Alan turns quiet as he makes the connection. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Just, um. Just stopped by to...read some pages for Colette. Yeah. 
There are no pages on the coffee table in front of William. 
72   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER                            72 
Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission. What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately, zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands. There. That felt good. 
Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.    What the hell? They exchange puzzled looks. 
73   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     73 
Henry talks to the camera. 
HENRY Hannah's avoiding me. She doesn't respond to emails or voice messages. She's "busy." Always an excuse. 
74   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   74 
Henry talks to the camera--his concern unmistakable. 
HENRY Things have definitely changed between us. I did get to go to her place for dinner last night. 
75   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - EVENING                                75 
A spruced-up Henry sits down for dinner.   All smiles. 
HENRY (V.O.) Hannah wasn't there. She was in New York with her publisher. But Maureen and I had a lovely time. 
Maureen passes Henry more vegetables. 
76   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      76 
Colette sits on her private bench. Note the NEW PHOTO OF OPRAH in a new frame. Colette talks to the camera. 
COLETTE Yes. You noticed. I replaced the photo. I may be replacing other things around here soon...I was just using William...for research. 
She holds up THREE MORE LETTERS. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Speaking of rejection...three more letters saying Nyet, including one from David Keller. I should have offered him a massage. How much more rejection can I take? 
Colette stares at the letters, focusing on remaining strong. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) (Reciting) "We keep going back, stronger, not weaker, because we will not allow-- 
Her voice cracks.   She stops.   Fighting for composure 
COLETTE (CONT'D) --Rejection to beat us down-- 
Colette's frustration is boiling into anger as she struggles to keep it under control. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) --It will only strengthen our resolve. To be successful there is no other way." Mr. Henry D. Thoreau. 
Short beat. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Rejection sucks. 
77   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      77 
Smoke rises from the fire pit, burning what's left of the letters. Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM. 
It isn't enough today. Watch as Colette's solemn chant dissolves into tears of frustration.

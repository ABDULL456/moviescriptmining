She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left untouched. 
CONNIE I'll bring him out to you as soon as he comes. 
She moves back to the main house. 
MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL 
He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine. 
EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY 
There are a few chairs. 
MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE 
He is eighteen years old. 
ANTHONY Hello, Dad. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
squinting up at his son. 
MICHAEL Anthony. 
He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than he; he embraces him. 
MICHAEL You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me. 
ANTHONY I was taller than you when I was fourteen. 
MICHAEL Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out. 
ANTHONY I'm not hungry. 
MICHAEL Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then. 
Connie approaches them. 
CONNIE Don't let me interrupt anything, this will just take a second.  Here. (she takes out a small needle, and begins to prepare it) Your father has to have his insulin shot.  Why don't you go to your room and put your things away, Anthony. 
She begins to give Michael the shot. 
MICHAEL Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk. 
Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things. Connie gives Michael the shot. 
CONNIE Whenever I see that lake so cold, I think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a person drowns in it, that the body will remain mid-suspended -- perfectly preserved.  Some say it will remain forever. 
She finishes the shot, puts her things away. 
CONNIE Your boy will be right back. 
She leaves. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
Alone in the garden. 
OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move CLOSER to Michael. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT 
SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room. 
SONNY Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi. Here... my brother Fredo, here's my Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking? And Carlo, this is my kid sister Connie.  Here, pull up a chair, Carol is sitting next to Connie. Oh, the droopy kid over there is Mike.  The college boy. 
An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with presents.  This is TESSIO. 
TESSIO Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon Natale... (he smiles at Tom Hagen) Hi, Tom, how's every little thing? 
HAGEN (helping him with the presents) Wonderful, Sal. 
Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters. 
DON CORLEONE Is dinner ready? 
MOM Two minutes. 
The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass. 
DON CORLEONE A good life, a long life to all my children, and friends.  To my grandchildren, and those that will be.  To our family. 
They all drink. 
They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast. 
TESSIO To our Godfather. 
They all drink. 
INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT 
The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone seated at the head of the table. 
SONNY What'd you think of those Japs, eh? The nerve of those Japs, coming right here in our own backyard dropping bombs! 
HAGEN Well, we could have expected it after the embargo. 
SONNY Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs don't have a right to drop bombs in our backyard.  Whose side you on? 
MAMA Please, do we have to talk about the war at the table?  On Christmas, much less. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
He has been listening to this discussion. 
MICHAEL Pop, I've decided I'm going to enlist. 
A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries to make light of it. 
SONNY Kid, stay in college.  The girls are cuter, if you know what I mean. 
HAGEN Pop had to pull a lot of strings to get you your deferment. 
MICHAEL I never asked for it; I don't want it. 
VIEW ON DON CORLEONE 
Disturbed; but wise and prudent. 
DON CORLEONE My son wants to talk about this, and so we'll talk, but not at the dinner table. 
He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then he looks back. 
DON CORLEONE Michael. 
He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around. People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael follows his father into the study.

I wish there was something I could do for you\u0097 \nSTEW \nWell, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide. \n(he leans over closer to her) \nThere is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler. \nThe smile goes out of Anne's eyes\u0097the suspicion returns\u0097she is saying to herself\u0097\"I was right the first time!\" \nSTEW \n(engagingly) \nI haven't had any lunch yet.

Stew has the manner of having lived in this house all his life. He draws the cup of tea to him and puts in a lump or two of sugar. \nBetween him and Anne on the corner of the table is a modernistic, squatty little tea-pot. \nSTEW \nAfter years of research, I finally discovered that I was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play, so believe it or not, in my spare time I'm now writing a play. \n69. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nAnne is casually amused. \nANNE \nReally? \nSTEW \nYeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village. \nANNE \nYou're a bit eccentric, aren't you? \nSTEW \nMe? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me\u0097 \nANNE \nYou don't wear garters! \nStew helps himself to another lump of sugar. \nSTEW \nNaw, that's just a symbol of my independence. \nHe leans closer, looking directly into her face. \nSTEW \nI'm color blind. That's what's wrong - I'm color blind. I've been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. \nAnne smiles at this unexpected statement, and stares at him very critically. \nANNE \nI'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you. \nSTEW \nSay, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me. \nSTEW \n(leaning closer) \nNow getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them? \nANNE \nNot if you're going to lose any sleep about it. \n70.

SCHUYLER \nThat's an excellent idea. \nANNE \nOh, hello Mother! \nSTEW \n(easily) \nHello - hello, Mrs. Schuyler. Come right in. Will you have a slug of tea? \nHe hospitably indicates the table. Mrs. Schuyler is speechless with fury. She does not immediately reply. Then: \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nWhat is this person doing here? \nANNE \nWhy\u0097 \nStew goes on. \nSTEW \nAs a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes.

Go back to your work. \n(returning his attention to Stew) \nNow don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms? \nSTEW \nNo, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all. \nCONROY \nWhy not? \nSTEW \nWell, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe. \nCONROY \nWhat do I care about your mother-in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you!

(Some slightly profane, pounding him on the back, whooping, and in general manifesting great surprise and glee.)

She is fighting hard to keep her emotions under control. \nStew enters the speakeasy and mingles with patrons, who offer congratulations. He comes to a stop by the table. She looks up, forcing a smile. \nSTEW \nWell, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for? \nGALLAGHER \nI didn't run away. \nStew draws out the other chair at the table and sits down. \n101.

I wish you all the luck in the world, pal. \nShe puts her hand tenderly on his. \nSTEW \nThanks, thanks. \nGALLAGHER \nI hope you'll be very happy. \nStew expands under the comradeship of Gallagher.

I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her. \nGALLAGHER \nWho me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay. \n102.

Thank you, Joe. \n(returning his attention to Gallagher) \nTell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know.

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO \n", "test2_true": "(quietly) \nNot since you broke into society. \nSTEW \n(waxing reminiscent) \nRemember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway!

You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men. \nSTEW \n(resentfully) \nSay, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat? \nGallagher tries to be elaborately casual. \nGALLAGHER \nOh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why - \nSTEW \nCut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that. \nGallagher looks up and off, seeing something that startles her. \n106. MED.

She looks back at him for a moment - then drops her head. Stew is oblivious to this by-play. Conroy turns to Stew. \nCONROY \nWell, when are you quitting? \nSTEW \nQuitting? I'm not thinking about quitting. \nJoe comes in with a drink for Conroy. \nCONROY \nI take it you don't have to work for a living any more\u0097 \nHe takes a sip of his drink and looks over meaningfully. \nCONROY \n\u0097Mr. Schuyler . \nSTEW \n(in a flash of anger) \nNow get this, Conroy.

The socks are strangely taut. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nThe reporter glances up and sees that Stew cannot see him, and then carefully lifts Stew's trouser leg a few inches. \nINSERT: Stew's feet and legs. As the reporter's hand lifts the trouser leg, the fancy solid-gold garters are on full display. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nThe reporter stares at them goggle-eyed. He can hardly contain himself at the sight of the garters. He looks off: \nREPORTER \n(cautiously) \nPsst! \n137. WIDER SHOT \nOne or two other reporters hear him and look over curiously. The reporter looks very mysterious and important and makes a motion for silence and caution. They get up and cross on tip-toe to join him. \n138. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe men around Stew. They quietly gather around his feet and the reporter who made the discovery proudly displays his find. One or two more step by and all stare. Stew still has the paper up in front of his face. \nFIRST REPORTER \nIs it real? \n2ND REPORTER \nOf course it's real! \n3RD REPORTER \nAny diamonds on them? \nREPORTER \nMusta set him back at least six bits.[11] \n139.

He is suddenly attracted by this unusual conversation and lowers his paper, revealing the group of six or seven men in a huddle round his feet. \n2ND REPORTER \nOne just can't wear those and be decent. \n3RD REPORTER \nYes you can, if you belong to the Four Hundred.[12] \n2ND REPORTER \nI wonder what number he is. \nStew flares in anger. Several of them are bending low to get a close peek. With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his foot forward and sends a couple of them sprawling. Stew gets to his feet. \nSTEW \nGo on, get out of there! What's the matter with you mugs? Didn't you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on before? \n140. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe two reporters who have done most of the talking scramble to their feet. The second reporter speaks in mock perplexity. \nREPORTER \nWhat do you suppose he wears them for? \n2ND REPORTER \nCan it be possible to hold his socks up? \n3RD REPORTER \nYeah, exactly. \n(effeminately) \nYou know, one's hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like, don't you think so, percifield? \nStew gets up as his phone rings. He pays no attention to it. Hank, another reporter, answers. \n4TH REPORTER \n(same effeminacy) \nYes, my dear chap - they look ghastly - they look ghastly! \nSTEW \nGo on! Screw!

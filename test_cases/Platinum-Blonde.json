{"train": "PLATINUM BLONDE \nStory by Harry E. Chandlee and Douglas W. Churchill \nFADE IN \n1. INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT \nGeneral atmosphere, typical of a busy newspaper office. Copy boys running about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters. Little wire baskets containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such as are used in some department stores, etc. \nSOUND \n(Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office) \nWhen shot has been fully established: \nCAMERA STARTS TRUCKING DOWN MAIN AISLE \nIt takes in the battery of Morkrum machines clattering away; the crescent-shaped copy desk; the desk of the sporting editor, with a big cauliflower-eared pugilist and his manager standing by the side of the sporting editor, a hefty guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big cigar and wearing a green eye-shade; the desk of the society editor, a prissy old lady, who takes down a worn copy of the Blue Book as the camera passes her and starts looking up some data; and any other interesting or typical bits that can be thought out. At the far end of the room is the desk of Conroy, the City Editor. \nEverything shows evidence of feverish activity and great haste. \n2. CLOSE SHOT \nOn Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, speaking on the telephone. \nCONROY \nYeah, that's all I ever get from you guys - a lot of hard luck stories. You come back here and I'll give you an assignment. It will be a last interview - with the cashier! \nHe hangs up, looks around with a scowl. \nStew! Stew Smith! \nREPORTER \nOh Mr. Conroy, give me a crack at that Schuyler story, will you? \nCONROY \nYou? If you ever got your foot into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug! Stew is the only man that's got brains enough to handle this. Scram! \nA Copy Boy rushes by on an errand. \nSay Spud, did you find Stew? \nCOPY BOY \nNot yet. \nCONROY \nWell, did you look in the\u0097 \nCOPY BOY \nFirst place I looked. \nCONROY \nNot there, eh? For cryin' out loud, where is that\u0097? Go and dig him up! Stew! Stew Smith! \nCAMERA TRUCKS ON: \nUntil it takes in a sort of make-shift screen, concealing a corner of the room. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n3. CLOSE SHOT \nOn the other side of the screen. Stew Smith is holding something in his hand. His hat tilted back on his head, and he is regarding this plaything intently. Gallagher is sitting close to him, also gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] on the newspaper, dressed in a trim but inexpensive little tailored suit. \nSTEW \nHere it is. Pray for me, Gallagher. Pray for me. Hold everything . . . \n4. CLOSE SHOT \nOn the object in his hand, one of those hand-puzzles where you have to land jumping beans in the holes. \n5. DOUBLE SHOT \nGALLAGHER \nStew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again. \nSTEW \nCome on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come! \nConroy's shouts are heard in the background. \nGALLAGHER \n(conspiratorially) \nThe boss is getting hoarse. \nSTEW \nThere's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that. \n6. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nConroy, the City Editor at his desk, looking about with a scowl for Stew. \nCONROY \n(bellowing) \nStew! Stew Smith! \nThe Copy Boy races over to whisper something to Conroy. \nCONROY \nWhat? The screen? \n7. CLOSE SHOT \nOn Stew Smith \nSTEW \nGallagher! I made it! \n8. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM CONROY'S ANGLE) \nThe screen, concealing the washbasin corner. \nCONTINUATION, SCENE 6 \nA wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering suspiciously on something. With his eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his desk. Still looking off, he heaves it forcefully. \n9. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nShowing the screen. The telephone book crashes into it, overturning it and revealing Stew and Gallagher on the other side. They both look up, startled. The newsroom erupts in laughter. \nCONTINUATION, SCENE 6 \nConroy, glaring off fiercely. \nCONROY \nCome over here! \n10. MEDIUM SHOT \nConroy at his desk. Stew saunters into the scene. \nSTEW \nLook, I quit! \nCONROY \nYeah? \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(sarcastic) \nIf you had to make a fool of yourself, why didn't you tell it to her instead of writing? \nMICHAEL \nBecause I couldn't get her on the phone. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nImbecile! \nANNE \nYou should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nI should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces. \nANNE \nSplendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nOh, shut up! \nA butler appears in the doorway. He is about to say something, but he stammers and turns. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(stopping him) \nWhat is it, Smythe? \nSMYTHE \nPardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen? \nMrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at Grayson. \n17. CLOSER SHOT \nMrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises and speaks imperiously: \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nDexter, go out and tell those ruffians I have nothing to say. \nGrayson faces her placatingly. \nGRAYSON \nYou can't do that. Leave it to me. I know how to handle reporters. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(with a shudder) \nAll right, then - get it over with. \n18. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nGrayson turns officiously toward the waiting butler. \nGRAYSON \nWe've decided to see the reporters. Send in the man from the Tribune first. \nSMYTHE \nVery good, sir. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nOh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me. \nSMYTHE \nI've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready. \nThe butler exits. \n19. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - DAY - FULL SHOT \nThis room resembles the Grand Central Station. It is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and luxury. \nPresent are Stew and Bingy, reporter from the Tribune. Stew is seated, idly leafing through a first edition. \nBingy, still with his hat on, spots an expensive music box on a nearby table, opens it and does a little jig to the tune that is emitted. \n20. CLOSER SHOT \nBingy, as he lingers at the table. He is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face needs a shave and his pants need pressing. There is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie. On the table is a humidor. Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful of cigars. \n21. CLOSE SHOT - STEW \nAs he looks up from the book, he suggests: \nSTEW \nHey Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room. \nCONTINUATION, SCENE 20 \nBingy turns, putting the cigars in his pocket. \nBINGY \nMuch obliged. \n22. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nSmythe enters. \nSMYTHE \n(frigidly) \nMr. Grayson has decided to see you. \nBoth Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly. Smythe continues: \nSMYTHE \nThe gentleman from the Tribune, first. \n23. CLOSER THREE SHOT \nBingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed. \nSTEW \nThere are no gentlemen on the Tribune. \nSMYTHE \nI understand, sir. \nSmythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes by, Stew trips him. \nBINGY \nSay, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition. \nSTEW \nCouldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English. \nBINGY \nOh, is that so? \nSTEW \nBINGY \nOh yeah? \n28. MEDIUM SHOT \nGrayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy by the arm and leads him over to a corner of the room, assuming a confidential pose. \nGRAYSON \n(speaking as they walk) \nHowever, I've taken the trouble to prepare a little statement. Here it is. Here. \n29. CLOSER TWO SHOT \nGrayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and sees the contents. \nINSERT: ENVELOPE \nThe corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nBingy quickly shuts the envelope up. Grayson is watching him closely. \nGRAYSON \nSo, you see how silly that rumor is? \nBINGY \nWhy, sure. It's a lotta hooey. \nGRAYSON \nThat's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it. \nGrayson starts leading him toward the door. CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as Grayson leads him toward the door, talking as they walk. \nGRAYSON \nThank you very much. \nBINGY \nAll right, all right, don't mention it. \nGRAYSON \nGive my regards to your managing editor. \nBINGY \nI certainly will. \nThey stop at the door. Bingy extends a handshake, which is again refused. He stops and looks back at the jury. \n30. MEDIUM SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE \nThe Schuylers all sitting silently and contemplating him. \nBINGY \nWell, so long folks! \nHe flutters his eyes at Anne. \nBINGY \nThanks! \nHe takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler and is again gripped by a violent sneeze. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(rising to the occasion) \nUh, bless you! \nALL \nBless you! \nBINGY \nThanks. \nThe butler appears in the doorway behind him. Bingy exits past him, beaming. \nBINGY \n(waving to butler) \nSo long! \nGrayson nods to the butler. \nGRAYSON \nSmythe, bring in the other reporter. \nSMYTHE \nYes, sir. \n31. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nThe group awaiting the advent of the Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book in his hand. They give him the once-over. Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them with animation, not in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. He starts toward them. \n32. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Stew approaches them. \nSTEW \nSchuyler's the name, I presume? Yes, thank you, thank you. My name's Smith - Stewart Smith. No relation to John, Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't have everything. \nHe smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses Mrs. Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding her expression of obvious distaste. \nSTEW \nNice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. \n(indicates the book in his hand) \nWhat's Michael tearing the paper about? \nGRAYSON \nJust a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around. \n33. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON \nSTEW \nRumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor? \nGRAYSON \nNo breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court. \nSTEW \n(very cagey) \nOh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars. \n34. A MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP \nAt this, Mrs. Schuyler rises wrathfully. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(furiously to Grayson) \nDexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand\u0097and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel! \nBecause my name's Schuyler too. And I haven't done a thing, but I'll suffer with Michael. And so will Mother. \n40. CLOSEUP - STEW \nHe has been listening to this and enjoying it immensely. He looks over at Mrs. Schuyler. \n41. REVERSE ANGLE ON MRS. SCHUYLER \nWho is making a show of holding back a flood of tears. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 40 \nSTEW \nMother's suffering already! \nCONTINUATION SCENE 39 \nAnne, not wanting to lose her point, looks up at Stew pleadingly. \nANNE \nAs a special favor to me, you won't print that story, will you? \nCONTINUATION SCENE 40 \nStew, looking down at her in frank approval and admiration. \nANNE \n(pleading) \nPlease\u0097 \nStew hesitates still. \n42. MEDIUM SHOT \nMrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson. All watching the couple intently, hanging on the next words\u0097wondering if Anne is going to succeed. They are tense and expectant. \n43. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW \nHe is looking down into her soft, melting eyes. Then he smiles. \nSTEW \nYou know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds. \nANNE \nOh, thank you, I knew you'd understand. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 42 \nThe three. They relax and exchange relieved and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne has won. \n44. MEDIUM SHOT - ENTIRE GROUP \nStew turns aside. \nSTEW \nMay I use your telephone? \nANNE \n(eagerly) \nCertainly. Right over there. \nSTEW \nYou're all right. \nShe indicates. Stew starts for the telephone. Anne walks to her mother's side. Stew gets to the telephone and picks up the receiver. \nSTEW \nHello, Beekman 1300? \n(he turns to wink at the group) \nThat's an unlucky number. You know that, don't you? \n45. CLOSE SHOT - STEW \nAt the telephone. He turns back to the instrument as he gets his connection. \nSTEW \n(into phone) \nHello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give me Conroy. \n(pause) \nHe isn't? Try the washroom, will you? \nWhile he waits for the connection, he turns and addresses the group expansively. \nSTEW \nSay, I interviewed a swell guy the other day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any garters. Neither do I as a matter of fact. What good are garters anyway\u0097? \n(he turns back to the phone) \nHello, Conroy? This is Smith talking. I'm up at the Schuylers. No, I'm not having tea - that is, not yet. \n(again, he winks expansively at the group\u0097then returns to Conroy) \nIs she beautiful? Oh boss, her pictures don't do her justice. If I was that guy Ziegfield - what? \n46. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND MRS. SCHUYLER \nAnne smiles in spite of herself at this flattery. Stew's voice goes on. \nSTEW'S VOICE \nYes, it's easy to see where her beauty comes from. From her mother. \nFor the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends to the extent of giving forth a smile. She cannot help but be pleased at this compliment. The atmosphere is now very friendly. Everybody feels that everything is all right. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 45 \nStew at the phone \nSTEW \nNow wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The Schuylers admit the story is true. Right. They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. But she's got some letters - and she's holding out for more dough - and it looks to me like she's going to get it. \n47. MEDIUM SHOT - SCHUYLER GROUP \nHorrified and shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing. \nSTEW \n(on the phone\u0097breezily) \nRight boss. I'll be right over. Right - no, I don't think I can get any pictures now. Right. \nHe casually hangs up and turns from the phone. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(involuntary gasp) \nOh-h-h . . .! \nAnne confronts him as if he were a reptile of the lowest order. \nANNE \n(voice cold as ice) \nI've met some rotters in my time, but without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse for a man I've ever had the misfortune to meet\u0097 \nStew starts walking toward the door, still holding his book. The family is tremendously indignant and agitated. \nWill - uh - five thousand be enough? \n65. DOUBLE SHOT \nSTEW \nFor what? \nANNE \nFor the letters, of course. \n66. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nAs Stew walks closer and addreses her. \nSTEW \nGee, you shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler. That's all right for your lawyer friend, but you shouldn't go around thinking you can buy people. \n(hands her the letters) \nThey're yours. \nAnne has been listening to him with a puzzled expression, impressed by his obvious sincerity. \nANNE \nI don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you. \nSTEW \nYour mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters. \n(grabs the letters) \nThat's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me. \n(with a smile, he hands the letters back) \nHere. \nANNE \nYou're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and \u0097 \n(gestures with letters) \n67. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nSTEW \n(patiently again) \nI know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail. \nAnne is regarding him with searching scrutiny. She smiles. Her icy, belligerent attitude has vanished. \nANNE \nI won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you\u0097 \nSTEW \nWell, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide. \n(he leans over closer to her) \nThere is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler. \nThe smile goes out of Anne's eyes\u0097the suspicion returns\u0097she is saying to herself\u0097\"I was right the first time!\" \nSTEW \n(engagingly) \nI haven't had any lunch yet. Have you got anything in the icebox? \nThe hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's face as she stares at this incredible guy with his incredible request. With a twinkle in her eyes, she responds: \nANNE \nOh, you fool! \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SCHUYLER DINING ROOM \n68. MED. FULL SHOT \nA lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes and colorful painted furniture. Stew and Anne are sitting at the table. Anne looks amused and \ndefinitely speculative. Stew has the manner of having lived in this house all his life. He draws the cup of tea to him and puts in a lump or two of sugar. \nBetween him and Anne on the corner of the table is a modernistic, squatty little tea-pot. \nSTEW \nAfter years of research, I finally discovered that I was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play, so believe it or not, in my spare time I'm now writing a play. \n69. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nAnne is casually amused. \nANNE \nReally? \nSTEW \nYeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village. \nANNE \nYou're a bit eccentric, aren't you? \nSTEW \nMe? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me\u0097 \nANNE \nYou don't wear garters! \nStew helps himself to another lump of sugar. \nSTEW \nNaw, that's just a symbol of my independence. \nHe leans closer, looking directly into her face. \nSTEW \nI'm color blind. That's what's wrong - I'm color blind. I've been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. \nAnne smiles at this unexpected statement, and stares at him very critically. \nANNE \nI'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you. \nSTEW \nSay, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me. \nSTEW \n(leaning closer) \nNow getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them? \nANNE \nNot if you're going to lose any sleep about it. \n70. CLOSE SHOT \nGRAYSON \nWhen you get through with him? \n76. DOUBLE SHOT \nANNE \nYes, it'll be a very interesting experiment. \nGRAYSON \n(sneering) \nTo make a gentleman out of a tramp? \nANNE \nExactly. \nGRAYSON \nNow, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player? \nANNE \nYou don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains. \n77. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nGrayson seats himself beside her on the divan. \nGRAYSON \n(fervently) \nBut what about me, Anne? \nShe looks at him coldly with almost an expression of dislike. \nANNE \nYou? Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APT. - NIGHT \n78. MED. SHOT TRUCKING \nAn elaborate, modernistic roof apartment, thronged with people all in evening dress. Stew and Anne are walking down among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily guiding her among the stuffed shirts. Anne stops before a group. There is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink of glasses, music from stringed invisible orchestra, etc. \nANNE \nHello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff\u0097 \nSTEW \nHow-di-do. \nGROUP \n(ad-lib acknowledgements) \n79. MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEXTER GRAYSON \nStanding, helping himself to a cocktail, which a footman is passing about. Dexter looks off with a frown of disapproval. \n80. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP OF WOMEN \nThey are looking off in Anne's direction. \nFIRST WOMAN \nSay, who's Anne's new boyfriend? \nSECOND WOMAN \nWell, if these old ears don't deceive me, I believe his name is Smith. \nFIRST WOMAN \nSmith! Can't be one of the brothers - he hasn't a beard on.[6] \nSECOND WOMAN \nWell, he must have something if Anne has got her clutches on him. \nThere is the sound of a piano chord being struck. \n81. MED. FULL SHOT \nMrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an anaemic-looking young man. Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter bows toward the swarthy one, who bends almost double in acknowledgement. There is a polite scattering of applause, and some of the guests seat themselves. \nMartini starts to sing. \nUnnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne slip out of the door into the roof garden. \nEXT. ROOF GARDEN \n82. MED. FULL SHOT \nA most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a few choice marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house. The garden is dark except for the lights from the interior of the house. From within, comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental Italian love song. This will continue to the FADE OUT of the scene. \nStew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, toward the edge of the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple of glorified steamer chairs are placed. There is a full moon overhead. \nShe leads him toward a waterfall effect, a glass partition down which water trickles. They go behind the dimly lit fountain and sit \nin a low, deep divan. We see them in silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace. All we hear is the faint voice of Martini\u0097and the uninterrupted splashing of the fountain. \nCUT TO: \n83. CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW \nOn divan, arms around each other. \nSTEW \nAnne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out of here. Give me the air. Throw me out of this joint, will you? \nAnne smiles happily and pinches his nose. \nANNE \nWhy should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling? \nSTEW \nThrow me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne. \nANNE \n(passionately) \nNone of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me. \nSTEW \n(struggling) \nMy name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. \nANNE \n(although he is very close to her) \nThat's because you're too far away, Stew. \nThroughout his speech, Anne never takes her eyes off him. As he fumbles now, he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming desire for Anne overcomes him. \nHe dismisses as futile his effort to be practical, sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nINT. CITY ROOM OF MORNING POST - DAY \nI've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! \n(he notices other reporters milling around) \nWell! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. \n(returning his attention to Stew) \nNow don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms? \nSTEW \nNo, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all. \nCONROY \nWhy not? \nSTEW \nWell, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe. \nCONROY \nWhat do I care about your mother-in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you? \nSTEW \nYes, sir. \nCONROY \nWell, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all. \nHe dismisses Stew with a wave of his hand. \nSTEW \nThanks for your congratulations. \n96. MEDIUM SHOT \nStew turns away from Conroy's desk, and a group of his confreres come up, surrounding him in a series of ad-lib congratulations. (Some slightly profane, pounding him on the back, whooping, and in general manifesting great surprise and glee.) This group is increased by copy readers, office boys and everybody jabbering and shouting at him. \nGROUP \n(ad-lib congratulations) \nStew manages to break thru them and exits from scene. \n97. MEDIUM SHOT \nGallagher\u0097to intercut with above scene. She gets up and goes over, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER and picks up another copy of the paper and reads the headlines. \n98. CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER \nHer face stricken and sick as she reads about Stew's marriage. Abruptly she turns away, out of scene. \n99. MEDIUM SHOT \nAt Gallagher's empty desk. Stew comes in trying to stave off the mob. He turns on the congratulators, pushing them off. \nSTEW \nWhat's the matter with you mugs? Can't a guy get married without all this? \n(looks around) \nWhere's Gallagher? Anybody seen Gallagher? \nHe forcibly breaks away from them and walks back toward the door, the last of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers being flung after him. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JOE'S SPEAKEASY \n100. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nGallagher is seated alone at a table, looking very forlorn. Her life is suddenly empty. A drink is in front of her, untouched. She is fighting hard to keep her emotions under control. \nStew enters the speakeasy and mingles with patrons, who offer congratulations. He comes to a stop by the table. She looks up, forcing a smile. \nSTEW \nWell, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for? \nGALLAGHER \nI didn't run away. \nStew draws out the other chair at the table and sits down. \n101. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO \nHe looks across at her, grinning boyishly, utterly unaware that what he has done has hurt her deeply. \nSTEW \nSure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy? \nGALLAGHER \n(with sincerity) \nSure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal. \nShe puts her hand tenderly on his. \nSTEW \nThanks, thanks. \nGALLAGHER \nI hope you'll be very happy. \nStew expands under the comradeship of Gallagher. He wants to talk. \nSTEW \nOh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes? \nGALLAGHER \nIt's the smoke. \nSTEW \n(calling to bartender) \nJoe! A little snifter. \n(returning his attention to Gallagher) \nSay, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh? \n(he notices the newspaper, which Gallagher has been reading) \nLook at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her. \nGALLAGHER \nWho me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay. \n102. CLOSE SHOT - STEW \nAs his drink is served. \nSTEW \nAh! Thank you, Joe. \n(returning his attention to Gallagher) \nTell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher? \n103. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO \nCONROY \nIs that so? \nSTEW \nThat's so. \n109. CLOSEUP - CONROY \nHe shows that he is genuinely interested in Stew and his problems, but can't help being a little sarcastic. \nCONROY \nAnne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - you're not even in the phone book. Think that one over, sucker. \nCAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of GALLAGHER. \nGALLAGHER \n(quickly in Stew's defense) \nThat doesn't make any difference\u0097 \n(quietly) \n\u0097if they love each other. \nCAMERA PANS BACK to CLOSEUP of CONROY. \nCONROY \nBlah! It's like a giraffe marrying a monkey. \n(looking off at Stew) \nListen - you'll never be anything but just the reporter that married the Schuyler's millions. Stew Smith is dead and buried. From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's husband. A rich \nwife's magnolia. If you can smoke that without getting sick, you're welcome to it. \nCAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of STEW: \nGALLAGHER'S VOICE \nBut that's perfectly ridiculous. \nSTEW \n(defensively) \nWait a minute. Now, Gallagher, let me do the talking. Get this, Conroy - Anne Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all right - and I married her, all right - but her dough and me? No connection. \n110. MED. CLOSE THREE SHOT \nGallagher is looking fixedly at Stew - very much worried about Conroy's dismal prophecies. Conroy shakes his head in sorrowful gloom. \nCONROY \n(as if he had not heard Stew) \nJust a boid in a gilded cage -[10] \nSTEW \nA what? \nCONROY \nYou heard me. A bird in a gilded cage. \nSTEW \nAw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that? \nCONROY \n(sarcasm) \nAnd live on your salary, I suppose? \nSTEW \nYeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play. \nCONROY \n(snorts) \nWhat play? \nSTEW \nMy play. \nCONROY \nThe one about the Siberian bloodhound? \nSTEW \nSiberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now. \nCONROY \nAraby? \nSTEW \nSure. \nCONROY \nAraby, my eye\u0097! \n111. WIDER SHOT \nConroy, having finished his drink, pushes back his chair and rises. He puts an affectionate hand on Stew's shoulder. \nCONROY \nWell, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey\u0097 \n(starts away) \nLet me know when you're quitting. \nSTEW \nI'm not quitting! \nCONROY \nNo? \nSTEW \nNo! \nCONROY \n(singing) \n'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see\u0097' \n(he waves his hand) \nTweet, tweet - ha, ha\u0097 \nHe laughs loud and raucously and exits. \n112. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER \nStew glares after Conroy. \nSTEW \n(under his breath) \nMrs. Schuyler! \nGrayson does not acknowledge the greeting. Mrs. Schuyler, having drained the glass, dismisses the butler with a wave of the hand, and directs her attention again to the matter at hand. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(in command) \nWell, what's to be done? He's here now. \nThey are all silent - reluctant to speak in front of Stew. Stew looks at them all - a little puzzled - then he walks over toward Mrs. Schuyler. \n117. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMrs. Schuyler and Stew. \nSTEW \nNobody seems to want to do anything\u0097 \n(to Mrs. Schuyler, brightly) \nWhy not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what? \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(witheringly) \nAbout what? Your marriage to Anne! \nSTEW \n(with a tone of dismissal) \nOh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all. \n118. MEDIUM SHOT \nMrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws herself up with haughty dignity. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nYoung man, I want you to know that I object violently to this whole affair! \nThis finally brings Anne out of her seat. She rises and crosses to Stew, making a show of embracing him. \nANNE \nNow Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married. \nSTEW \n(to Mrs. Schuyler) \nI'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(furiously) \nStop calling me Mother! \nSTEW \n(easily) \nAll right, Grandma\u0097 \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(glaring) \nThis man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic! \n(she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial look at Anne) \nSee what you've done to me!? \nWithout another word, she turns and flounces angrily out of the room. Grayson follows her. At the doorway he pauses, starts to say something. They all look at him expectantly - but no words come out. \nSTEW \nGot it too, huh? \nGrayson gives a harrumph and exits. \n119. CLOSER MEDIUM SHOT \nAnne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins at Stew. \nMICHAEL \nWho won that round? \nMichael starts moving toward the door. \nSTEW \n(ruefully) \nI'm afraid your mother won that round - that is, she got in the last blow. \nMICHAEL \nI don't feel the way they do. You're really not as bad as everybody thinks. \nSTEW \n(effusively - shaking his hand) \nYou're beginning to appreciate me, eh? Thanks! \nMICHAEL \nDon't worry too much about Mother - she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs, I'll give you a little - \nHe indicates a snifter, grins and exits. Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm around his shoulder. \nSTEW \n(to Michael) \nA little\u0097? Sure, I'll be right up. \n(to Anne) \nHe's all right. I like him. \nANNE \nI'm glad. \nHe sees two figures pass above in a proscenium alcove, first Mrs. Schuyler, then Grayson. He makes an elaborate bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's return bow. \nSTEW \nHe can bend! \n120. CLOSER SHOT \nAnne takes a step backwards and sits down with him on one of the divans. CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts an arm about her. \nANNE \nCome here baby! \nAnne starts fussing abstractedly at Stew's tie. They kiss. \nANNE \nI haven't seen you for three hours. You're neglecting me already\u0097 \nDuring her speech she has been picking away at a stain on his tie. Stew looks down and notices it. \nSTEW \nWhat's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot\u0097 \nMr. Smith, sir! \nStill no response. The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently. \nDAWSON \nMr. Smith, sir\u0097 \nSleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy with sleep. \n128. MEDIUM SHOT \nDAWSON \nHow do you like your bath, sir? \nSTEW \nI like my bath all right. How do you like your bath? \nStew peers up, puzzled. \nSTEW \nWho are you? \nDAWSON \n(surprised) \nI'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir. \nSTEW \nYou're my what? \nDAWSON \nYour valet, sir. \nStew still stares at him. Then he nods to himself - thinks he gets the idea. Stew kicks back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas. Still sitting on the edge of the bed, he starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers. The valet bends on one knee to help him. \nSTEW \nThank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was? \nDAWSON \nDawson, sir. \nSTEW \nDawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night? \nDAWSON \nDrunk, sir? \nStew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown, but again the valet beats him to it - holding it for him and helping him slip into it. \nSTEW \nYes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet. \nDAWSON \nOh, but you didn't engage me, sir. \nStew, surprised, turns on him quickly. \nSTEW \nWho did engage you then, if I didn't engage you? What are you doing with my pants\u0097 \nThe valet picks up his pants. \nSTEW \nDid you take anything out of those pants? \nDAWSON \nOh no, sir! \nSTEW \nWhat are you doing fooling around in here? \nDAWSON \nMiss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir. \nStew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, without missing a beat, leans over and offers a light. A wary Stew accepts. \nSTEW \nHmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley. \n129. WIDER SHOT \nStew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table, waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal. The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for Stew to step into. \nSTEW \n(putting on the bathrobe) \nSay, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. \nDAWSON \nThank you, sir. \nSTEW \nBut not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today. \nThe valet pays no attention to him, but walks around the room, picking up the clothes that Stew has flung about. \nDAWSON \nOh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, as it were. Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it's really most essential, sir. \nStew, with his cigarette between his lips, stands watching the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast-off clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers, preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew. Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes him by the shoulder, and yanks him around to face him. \n130. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON \nThe valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on Stew's face. \nSTEW \n(over-sweetly) \nAre you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up? \nDAWSON \nQuite so. Quite. \nSTEW \nNow I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact. \nDAWSON \nNow Mr. Smith, now please\u0097 \nStew is rapidly losing his temper. \nSTEW \nYou've got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you? \nThe valet puts a bewildered hand to his face. \nDAWSON \nOh no, sir\u0097 \nOh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too! \nSTEW \n(picking up her sing-song) \nOh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear! \nHe bends to kiss her again, but she gently resists, and continues the sing-song. \nANNE \nOh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too! \nSTEW \nOh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters\u0097 \nANNE \nOh yes you will wear garters\u0097 \nThey melt into each other's arms. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY \n134. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nGeneral activity, as before. \nCAMERA TRUCKS DOWN THE MAIN AISLE until it centers on Stew at his desk, sitting low in his chair, his feet cocked up on the corner of his desk, reading a newspaper \nCAMERA TRUCKS UP CLOSER centering on his feet on the desk. One trouser leg is pulled slightly up and reveals a garter. \n135. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nStew, reading the newspaper. It is opened up before his face. \nINSERT: Headlines - about a three-column article: \nANNE SCHUYLER AND CINDERELLA HUBBY TO OCCUPY SCHUYLER MANSION \nAs Stew reads this, he looks very glum and depressed. \n136. MEDIUM SHOT \nA reporter, the one Stew had socked with a wad of paper in an earlier sequence, shambles past and stops abruptly, staring at Stew's feet. \nINSERT: Of what he sees. Stew's feet. The socks are strangely taut. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nThe reporter glances up and sees that Stew cannot see him, and then carefully lifts Stew's trouser leg a few inches. \nINSERT: Stew's feet and legs. As the reporter's hand lifts the trouser leg, the fancy solid-gold garters are on full display. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nThe reporter stares at them goggle-eyed. He can hardly contain himself at the sight of the garters. He looks off: \nREPORTER \n(cautiously) \nPsst! \n137. WIDER SHOT \nOne or two other reporters hear him and look over curiously. The reporter looks very mysterious and important and makes a motion for silence and caution. They get up and cross on tip-toe to join him. \n138. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe men around Stew. They quietly gather around his feet and the reporter who made the discovery proudly displays his find. One or two more step by and all stare. Stew still has the paper up in front of his face. \nFIRST REPORTER \nIs it real? \n2ND REPORTER \nOf course it's real! \n3RD REPORTER \nAny diamonds on them? \nREPORTER \nMusta set him back at least six bits.[11] \n139. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nStew. (Camera behind him and shooting over his head.) He is suddenly attracted by this unusual conversation and lowers his paper, revealing the group of six or seven men in a huddle round his feet. \n2ND REPORTER \nOne just can't wear those and be decent. \n3RD REPORTER \nYes you can, if you belong to the Four Hundred.[12] \n2ND REPORTER \nI wonder what number he is. \nStew flares in anger. Several of them are bending low to get a close peek. With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his foot forward and sends a couple of them sprawling. Stew gets to his feet. \nSTEW \nGo on, get out of there! What's the matter with you mugs? Didn't you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on before? \n140. MEDIUM SHOT \nThe two reporters who have done most of the talking scramble to their feet. The second reporter speaks in mock perplexity. \nREPORTER \nWhat do you suppose he wears them for? \n2ND REPORTER \nCan it be possible to hold his socks up? \n3RD REPORTER \nYeah, exactly. \n(effeminately) \nYou know, one's hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like, don't you think so, percifield? \nStew gets up as his phone rings. He pays no attention to it. Hank, another reporter, answers. \n4TH REPORTER \n(same effeminacy) \nYes, my dear chap - they look ghastly - they look ghastly! \nSTEW \nGo on! Screw! Get out of here! \nHe starts out when Hank calls to him: \nHANK \nHey, Stew! \nStew turns. \nHANK \n(indicating phone) \nCAMERA TRUCKS with them as they weave in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points out celebrated guests to her. \nMISS WILSON \nThere's the Spanish Ambassador. \nGallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman. \nGALLAGHER \nYou know, he looks like one. \nMiss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this point they are interrupted by a butler. \n149. MEDIUM SHOT \nBUTLER \nMiss Wilson\u0097 \nMISS WILSON \nYes? \nBUTLER \nMrs. Smith would like to see you. \nMISS WILSON \n(to Gallagher) \nWill you excuse me? Make yourself at home for just a moment, please. \nGALLAGHER \nThanks. \nMiss Wilson follows butler out of scene. Gallagher is left alone. She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here and there, searching for Stew. Finally she comes to a large open French door and steps out. \n150. INT. TERRACE LEADING OFF SCHUYLER BALLROOM \nSeveral groups of men and women are seated at tables. Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden. \n151. INT. SECLUDED SPOT IN GARDEN \nStew, his head cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher wanders into scene. She sees Stew and stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, with a happy smile on her lips, moves closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his face breaks into a happy grin. \nGALLAGHER \nMr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph. \nSTEW \nWell, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you. \nGALLAGHER \nThere you are\u0097! \n152. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO \nSTEW \nWell, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto? \nGALLAGHER \nI'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw. \nSTEW \nAw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here. \nGALLAGHER \nWell, I'll have to look someplace else. \nSTEW \nNo, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck. \nGALLAGHER \n(fixing his tie) \nSay, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten. \nHe suddenly realizes there's something different about Gallagher. He takes a step back so as to look her over carefully - blinks his eyes. \nSTEW \nGee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself? \nGALLAGHER \nNothing. \nSTEW \nWhat did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress? \nGALLAGHER \nI dyed one and washed the other. \nSTEW \n(enthusiastically) \nOh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good. \n153. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN \nAnne is walking in direction of Stew and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when she sees them. Her body stiffens. \nCUT BACK TO: \nANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER \nFrom Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing in the direction of Anne. \nGALLAGHER \nDon't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us. \nSTEW \nStaring at us? \nGALLAGHER \nMy mistake - she's glaring. \nSTEW \nMust be my wife. \nHe turns - sees Anne. \nSTEW \nIt is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. Stay right there, because I'm going to bring a friend up I want you to meet. \nThey exit. \n154. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE \nStanding as before. She is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and Gallagher come up to her. \nSTEW \nAnne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher. \nANNE \n(astounded) \nGALLAGHER \n(reassuringly) \nOh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help. \nSTEW \nNo, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. (pause) It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it? \nGALLAGHER \nYes. \nINT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL \n160. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nThe butler is just opening the door. Bingy, looking more disreputable than usual, steps inside. \nBINGY \nHello, there, Meadows![13] \nSMYTHE \n(disapproving once-over) \nWho is it you wish to see, sir? \nBINGY \nI want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith. \nSMYTHE \nPardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening\u0097 \nBINGY \nOh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know\u0097 \nHe is distracted by two elegantly-dressed ladies strolling by. \nBINGY \n\u0097a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die. \nSMYTHE \nI'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat. \nBINGY \nWell, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it. \nThe butler turns to leave, then turns back, his face expressing distinct disapproval. \nSMYTHE \nPardon me, sir, but I've heard that one before. \nINT. SCHUYLER BALLROOM \n161. CLOSE SHOT \nStew and Gallagher standing together. The butler is seen leaving the scene, having just informed Stew of Bingy's presence at the reception. \nSTEW \n(to Gallagher) \nExcuse me. I just want to make sure and see he doesn't take away any of the vases. \n(starts to leave, then turns back) \nWell, well, well! My little pal, Gallagher, a girl, huh? \n(unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her hand) \n(tenderly) \nThat's just to give you an idea that I know how to treat a gal. Get fresh with me and I'll sock you in that little nose of yours. Excuse me. I'll be right back. \nHe exits. Gallagher is left staring at her hand wonderingly. \nINT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL \n162. MED. SHOT \nBingy gets up from his throne chair, and crosses into the doorway of the library opposite him. He stops by a carved low-boy, and curiously examines a large antique vase. Stew comes in and stops with a smile as he sees him. \nBingy, his hand on the vase, looks up. Stew walks over to him. \nSTEW \n(referring to vase) \nWhat's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy to get in your pocket? \nBingy sets down the vase and surveys him. \nBINGY \nNo. I was just looking at it. Pretty, ain't it? I was just looking for the price tag. \nINT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY \n163. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO \nBingy looks him up and down in silent, insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn. \nSTEW \nWhat do you want? \nBINGY \nOh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman. \nSTEW \n(sore) \nWould you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy? \nBINGY \nOh boy, I'd love it. \nStew makes a complete turn and faces Bingy again. \nSTEW \nHow's that? \nBINGY \n(appraisingly) \nNot bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody. \nSTEW \nIs that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph? \nBINGY \nA photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet? \n(singing) \n\"Just A Gigolo . . . \"[15] \nSTEW \nNow get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it. \nShe is interrupted by the entrance of Grayson, who dashes into the room, his eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy of the morning paper. \nGRAYSON \n(tapping paper in hand) \nDid you see the papers? \"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!\" This is the most terrible kind of publicity that could possibly\u0097 \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(interrupting) \nDon't you think I know it, Grayson? \n(as Smythe the butler enters with tray) \nSmith - send for Mr. Smythe! Er - Smythe, send for Mr. Smith! \nSMYTHE \n(as he turns to go) \nDouble-strength! \nMRS. SCHUYLER \n(muttering, as she exits scene) \n\"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!\" \nGRAYSON \n(close behind, contemptuously) \n\"I wear the pants,\" says Anne Schuyler's husband! \nINT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY \n169. MEDIUM SHOT \nStew, now dressed in a business suit, comes from the direction of the stairs and stops just before he gets to the door of the drawing room. From within there is an ominous silence. Stew looks longingly in the direction of the front door - then back at the drawing room, squares his shoulders and goes in. \nINT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM \n170. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Stew stops just inside the doorway. He had been prepared for this, but it strikes terror into his soul, just the same. \n171. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nFrom his angle in the doorway. The jury - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back - is standing, gazing at Stew with a fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. Anne is crying softly. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 170 \nStew - looking around at the gallery of faces. Then he forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts to enter, whistling as he goes. \nSTEW \nGood morning, everybody\u0097 \n(he gets a cold, frigid, silent reception) \nWell, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? \n(to Anne) \nAnne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you? \n172. MEDIUM SHOT \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nHave you seen this? \n(shows him newspaper) \nSTEW \nYes - the worm! \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nI beg your pardon? \nSTEW \nHe's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him! \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nTo engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! \"I wear the pants!\" The pants ! Not even the trousers! \nGRAYSON \nI've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless. \n173. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON \nSTEW \nYou quit trying to stop anybody\u0097 \nGRAYSON \nWell, at best you might deny it. \nSTEW \nWhy deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut. \nGRAYSON \nTraps shut! \nSTEW \nCertainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally. \n(sees Anne crying) \nNow what are you crying about? \n174. MEDIUM SHOT \nANNE \nIs this true, Stewart? Did you really say it? \nSTEW \nYes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nAnd you struck him right here in our house\u0097? \nSTEW \nYes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man. \nGRAYSON \nWell, what else do you expect them to call you? \nANNE \nDexter. \n175. CLOSEUP - STEW \nSTEW \n(burning) \nThat's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now. \n176. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nGallagher at phone. \nGALLAGHER \nOh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene One: Coast of Norway - and then a lot of blank. Is that it? \nCONTINUATION SCENE 187 \nStew at phone. \nSTEW \nYeah. Come on, don't be silly. \n(pause) \nAll right, if you feel like you need a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You'll find him at Joe's, no doubt. Yeah. Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard. \n(pause) \nSure you would. I knew I could depend on you, old pal. Snap it up, will you, Gallagher? \nCONTINUATION SCENE 188 \nGallagher at phone. \nGALLAGHER \nOkay. \nShe hangs up, joyful at the prospect of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again. \nINT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \n189. MED. SHOT \nSOUND \n(bell ringing) \nStew comes out of the library. Smythe is going down the hall. Stew intercepts him. \nSTEW \nSmythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends. \nSMYTHE \nVery good, sir. \n190. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nAt entrance door. Stew enters and opens it. Gallagher and Hank enter. \nSTEW \nWell, Gallagher! Glad to see you. \nGALLAGHER \nHello, Stew. \nSTEW \nHello, Hank. How are you? \nHANK \nFine, but kinda thirsty. \nSTEW \nCome right in - I'll get you a drink. \nHANK \nOkay - you remember Joe\u0097 \nSTEW \nSure. \nHANK \nI sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you? \nSTEW \nIt's all right. Bring him in. \nJoe appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him. \nHANK \nCome in, Joe. It's all right. \nSTEW \nHello, Joe. \nJOE \nHello kid, how are you? Glad to see you. \nStew starts to close the door. \nJOE \nJust a minute - Johnson's outside. You don't mind if he comes in and dips a beak[17] do you? \nSTEW \nNo, no, bring him in. The more the merrier. \nJOE \nCome on in! \nJohnson appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him. \nSTEW \nHello, Johnson. \nJOHNSON \nHello, Stew, old pal. How are you? \nSTEW \nGlad to see you. Come in, kid. \nStew starts to close the door. \nJOHNSON \nWait a minute. I got two of the boys I brought along - they were cruising around with nothing to do. You don't mind if I bring them in? \nSTEW \nYou brought two of the boys? That's all right. Bring them in. What's the difference? \nThe two enter, followed in a single file by 12-14 men and women, all of whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares at them dumbfoundedly. \n191. MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nThey swarm into the hallway and overflow into the rooms on either side. The butler stands aghast at this invasion. Stew starts to close the door when three or four more troop in, shouting cheery greetings. Stew regards them in amazement. \n192. CLOSER SHOT - STEW \nAs he watches them file past. \nSTEW \nI'm sorry nobody could come. \nHANK \nShe turns as Stew walks over to her. \nGALLAGHER \n(smiling) \nWell, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory. \nSTEW \n(grins) \nHaven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place. \n197. CLOSER TWO SHOT \nStew, standing before her. \nGALLAGHER \n(seriously) \nStewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid? \nSTEW \n(grinning in spite of himself) \nBeen where? \nGallagher \nTo Old Madrid. \nSTEW \nNever even been to New Madrid. \nGALLAGHER \nThen how do you expect to write about it? \nSTEW \nOh - draw on my imagination, I suppose. \nGALLAGHER \nDid Conrad draw on his imagination? \nStew is brought up with a start. \nSTEW \nDid who? \nGALLAGHER \nConrad. \nSTEW \nWhat do you know about Conrad? \nGALLAGHER \nI don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about? \nStew is noticeably impressed with this point of view. \nSTEW \nGosh, you look cute. \nGallagher warms up to her subject. \nGALLAGHER \nIsn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? \nSTEW \nRight. \nGALLAGHER \nDidn't he go to sea before he wrote about it? \nSTEW \nRight. \n198. MEDIUM SHOT \nGALLAGHER \nThen why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme. \nSTEW \nGee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now . . . \nGALLAGHER \nOh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine \nSTEW \n(warming up - he puts arm around Gallagher's shoulder) \nAnd there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you! \nGALLAGHER \n(smiling) \nWhat could I be? \nSTEW \nYou could be something. \n(inspiration striking, he dashes to the typewriter) \nI've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you? \nGALLAGHER \nHere you are. \nSTEW \nAll right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start? \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL \n199. MED. FULL SHOT \nShooting through into the drawing room. It is many hours later. The members of the party, including Smythe, are pretty well lit. On the floor of the entrance hall a dice game is in progress. In the drawing room four or five are hanging over the piano singing \"The Grasshopper Jumped Over Another Grasshopper's Back.\" \nIn general, a large time is being had. As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing. A key is heard in the lock. \n200. CLOSER SHOT - GROUP - IN ENTRANCE HALL \nThe outer door starts to swing open. One of the party guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in his hand, staggers toward the door. It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in the opening. The guest comes up to them. \nGUEST \n(starting to close door) \nSay, you can't come in here - this is a private party. \nAnne pushes the door violently, which sends the guest sprawling. He stays where he lands, holding the bottle in both arms across his chest. Anne and her mother advance into a CLOSE SHOT and look off with incredulous horror and amazement. \n201. MEDIUM SHOT \nSTEW \nHave we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time. \nHe indicates by snapping his fingers. Gallagher quietly gathers up her things, apprehensive of the storm about to break. \nANNE \n(coldly) \nI'm not interested in the way her brain snaps. \nStew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her hat in her hand, her coat over her arm, starts for the door. \nGALLAGHER \nI think I better go, Stew. \nANNE \nI think you should, Miss Gallagher. \nSTEW \nWait a minute, Gallagher. \nGallagher stops, transfixed by the new tone in his voice. He comes over to Anne. \n209. CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANNE AND STEW \nSTEW \nWhat's the idea, Anne? \nANNE \nThe idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately. \nSTEW \nNow wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable? \nANNE \nUnreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom? \nSTEW \nNow wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I? \nANNE \n(pointedly) \nYour house? \nSTEW \n(getting the implication; after a pause) \nO-o-oh, I get you\u0097 \n(a knowing chuckle) \nAll right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne? \nAnne remains silent. That's exactly what she has done. \nSTEW \nI suppose I've been boarding out this past year. \n210. MEDIUM SHOT \nHe takes his coat off back of chair and slips into it. \nSTEW \n(quietly; grimly) \nAll right, I'll tell you this\u0097I don't like your boarding house, lady\u0097 \nAs he gathers up loose manuscript, he continues . . . \nSTEW \n\u0097and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out. \nANNE \nStewart! \nSTEW \n(hotly) \nThis is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that. \nANNE \nYou can't walk out of here like this. \nThroughout the scene, Stew is gathering his things together\u0097and probably packing an overnight bag. \nSTEW \nOh I can't? Who's going to stop me? I'd like to see somebody stop me. If you think I'm going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum, not on your life! You're going to make no stuffed shirt out of me. Now what do you think of that? \nMrs. Schuyler stalks majestically in. \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nWhat's going on here? Who is this woman? \nSTEW \n(snappily) \nJoan of Arc! What's it to you? \nMRS. SCHUYLER \nHeavens! The man's insane! \n211. CLOSEUP - STEW \nSTEW \nSure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you. \n(points to himself) \nThis magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother-in-law. \nGallagher's cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from Mrs. Schuyler. \nGALLAGHER \nEurek\u0097! \n212. MEDIUM SHOT \nStew is stuffing things into a bag. \nSTEW \n(heatedly to Anne) \nYou've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane\u0097 \n(indicating Mrs. Schuyler) \n\u0097goes out and counts the silverware. \nANNE \nThat's ridiculous. \n", "test1_input": "There you go, talking like a woman! \nGALLAGHER \n(a trifle resentfully) \nWell! \nSTEW \nWell, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me. \nDuring these last few speeches, Gallagher has been regarding him with a curious expression. She loves being his pal, but wishes he would realize she is also a woman. \n53. MEDIUM SHOT \nStew seems a little resentful of her attitude. He rises. \nSTEW \nPay that check, will you Gallagher? I'll give it back to you some time. Maybe. \nHe flourishes the book of Conrad, which has been lying on the table in front of him, and makes a grand gesture. \nSTEW \nI go now - I go with Conrad in quest of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher? \nHe strikes a pose\u0097and exits. \nGallagher, sits, looking after him, considerably disturbed. \n54. CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER \nSitting, looking dismally after Stew. \nShe opens her bag and takes out a mirror, surveying herself with frank disapproval. She pulls out a curl of hair before each ear, tries to soften the severe brim of the hat. She puts a finger to the tip of her nose and tilts it up, studying the effect. Then, with a sigh of disgust, she throws mirror and bag onto the table. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \n55. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY - LONG SHOT \nSmythe, the butler, previously introduced, comes from the direction of the rear of the house, and proceeds down the long, vast hallway towards the front door. The bell keeps ringing steadily. \nThe butler reaches the wide front door. \n56. CLOSER SHOT \nAs the butler opens the door and reveals Stew standing outside, hatless, a book in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly askew, the pockets bulging with contents. The butler quickly tries to slam the door in Stew's face, but Stew's right foot comes forward with a practiced newspaperman's gesture and he forces his way into the room. \nSTEW \n(reproachfully) \nNow, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it? \nSMYTHE \n(stiffly) \nThe name is Smythe. \nSTEW \nSmythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh? \n(wags his head) \nCongratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake! \n(he grabs the butler's hand) \nNow, as a Smith to a Smythe\u0097 \nSMYTHE \n(glacially) \nMrs. Schuyler is not at home. \n57. TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE \nSTEW \nI know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together. \n58. MEDIUM SHOT \nAnne, dressed in smart sports clothes, starts to cross thru the hall. She stops as she sees the butler engaged in conversation with Stew. \nSMYTHE \n(hollowly) \nNo one's at home, sir. \nAnne starts walking toward them. Stew spots her. \nSTEW \nNow Jeeves, what would you call this - 'no one'? \nAnne comes up to them. \n59. CLOSER THREE SHOT \nAnne looks up and sees that the butler is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses him. \nANNE \nWhat's wrong? \nSMYTHE \nMrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that if this person came here again, I was to call the police. \nSTEW \nThat's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge. \nANNE \nYou may go, Smythe. \nSMYTHE \nBut I\u0097 \nSTEW \nNow the lady said you may go\u0097 \nThe butler bows stiffly and exits. \nANNE \n(to Stew\u0097directly) \nWhat do you want? \nSTEW \nWell, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand. \nHe extends the Conrad book, and Anne, making no effort to take it, he throws it on the table. \nANNE \n(haughty) \nThat's considerate of you. \nSTEW \nYeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it. \n60. CLOSER TWO SHOT \n", "test1_true": "(stiffly) \nI'm not interested in your literary recommendations. \nSTEW \nWell, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance\u0097 \nHe takes a package of letters out of his overcoat pocket held together by a rubber band. He extracts one of them and opens it. \nSTEW \nJust listen to this\u0097 \n(reading) \nAdorable Babykins\u0097 \nDoes her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely\u0097! \nANNE \n(interrupting coldly) \nJust a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me. \nStew advances a little closer, putting up a finger. \nSTEW \n(mysteriously) \nAh! But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is. \nANNE \nI'm not interested. Smythe will open the door. \nShe begins to walk away. \nSTEW \n(brightly) \nBut Bobo is your brother, Michael. And of course nobody would ever guess who Babykins is. \nAnne turns and stares at him, incredulously, for a moment. \nANNE \nWhere did you get those letters? \nSTEW \nI stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo. \nAnne looks up coldly. \nANNE \nI suppose you're going to print them? \nSTEW \nNo - give you another guess. \n61. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT (TRUCK SHOT) \nThe two. \nAnne surveys him with frank scorn and dislike. \nANNE \n(scornfully) \nOh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious. \nSTEW \nSo, it's obvious, huh? \nShe turns toward the library. \nANNE \nWill you step into the library? \nSTEW \n(with alacrity) \nSure, I'll take a chance. \nAnne walks majestically with head held high\u0097thru the hall\u0097thru the living room and to the library. CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF THEM. This is a very long walk with Anne walking ahead, Stew trailing. \nSTEW \n(while walking with Anne single file) \nYou know, the Indians used to walk like this. \n(pause) \nExcept the squaw always walked in the back\u0097 \n(pause) \nYou know why that was? That was in case of attack from the front. \n(pause) \nOf course, if the attack was from the rear, she had to depend upon her papoose. \n(pause) \nOh yes, the papooses always had bows and arrows. \n(pause) \nOf course, if she wasn't married\u0097then she'd have to protect her own - er, er\u0097 \n(indicates rear with thumb over shoulder) \n(still walking) \nWhat country is this library in? \n(pause) \nMiss Schuyler, how about carfare back to the front door, huh? \n62. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - MEDIUM SHOT \nAnne sweeps in, followed by Stew. She walks directly to a desk, opens a drawer and takes out a large check book. She draws up a chair and seats herself. \n63. CLOSE SHOT \nAnne at the desk, starting to fill in the date on a blank check. \nANNE \nWhat are your initials - Mr. - er\u0097 \n64. CLOSE SHOT - STEW \nWho has remained standing. He is watching her with a peculiar expression. \nSTEW \nSmith. Stewart Smith. My friends call me Stew. It's an injustice too because I hold my liquor all right. \nCONTINUATION SCENE 63 \nAnne writes on the check. Then she looks up. \nANNE \n", "test1_id": 507, "test2_input": "STEW \nYes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters. \nANNE'S VOICE \nDo you know you're talking about my friends? \nSTEW \nYes, I'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters. \n183. DOUBLE SHOT \nANNE \nWell, are you going - or aren't you? \nStew makes a move to embrace her. \nSTEW \nAnne, come here. Listen\u0097 \nANNE \n(sternly - slipping away from him) \nLook out for my lipstick, Stewart. \nSTEW \nI'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves\u0097 \nANNE \n(interrupting) \nAre you crazy? \nSTEW \nThink of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that? \nANNE \nWill you stop being silly, Stewart? \nSTEW \n(trying hard) \nI'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that? \nANNE \n(hard) \nBut I don't want to meet your gang. \nSTEW \nI don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile. \nANNE \nMeaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose? \nSTEW \nOh, they're all right, Anne. But I\u0097 \nANNE \n(interrupting belligerently) \nThat's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do. \nWith which violent declaration, she flounces out of the room, leaving Stew staring after her, angry and hurt. Impulsively, he follows her to the door - a retort on his lips. When he gets there, however, she has vanished. He returns to the room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks to window - stares out - turns back to room - heaves a lonely sigh. \nHe notices his reflection in the mirror, and gestures toward it. \nSTEW \nAnd that, my friends, is what is known as the society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter to go to - how-have-you-been, Mr. Smith! \n184. CLOSE SHOT \nAs Stew sits in a typewriter chair. He rolls up the sheet in the machine so that he can read what is already written. \nINSERT: TYPEWRITTEN SHEET, IN TYPEWRITER \nACT 1 \nSCENE 1 \nAN HACIENDA IN MEXICO \nStrumming of guitars are dimly heard. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nHe studies it for a moment, frowning in dissatisfaction. He's stuck. He leans back in the chair and looks up for inspiration. \nINSERT: A BIG CLOCK, TICKING AWAY THE TIME. \nINT. SCHUYLER GRAND FOYER \n185. LONG SHOT \nOf Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer. Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by the surroundings. He tries hopscotching on the pattern of the floor. That wears thin quickly. Supremely bored, Stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then appears, nervously crouched behind some grillwork. \n186. MEDIUM SHOT - STEW AND SMYTHE \nSMYTHE \nDid you call, sir? \nSTEW \nSmythe, come here. I want to talk to you. \n(Smythe looks unenthusiastic.) \nCome on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you? \nStew gives another shout and is rewarded with another loud echo. This coaxes Smythe out from behind the grillwork. \nSTEW \nShhh! Do you hear something? \nSMYTHE \nYes, sir. \nSTEW \nYou try it. \nSMYTHE \n(reluctant) \nMe, sir? \nSTEW \nYeah. \nSmythe gives it a timid try. \nSTEW \nNo, no. Give it more volume. \nSmythe gives a more satisfactory yell. Stew nods approval. Smythe begins yelling and shouting in earnest. \n", "test2_true": "No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted. \nSMYTHE \n(incredulous) \nNo, sir! \nSTEW \nYes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .? \nSMYTHE \nYes, sir. \nSTEW \nFound no skeletons? \nSMYTHE \nNo, sir. \nSTEW \nIt's haunted just the same. \nSMYTHE \nYes, sir. \nSmythe has heard enough. He turns to leave, but Stew grabs him. \nSTEW \nSmythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself? \nSMYTHE \nWell, sir, I putter. \nSTEW \nSmythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what? \nSMYTHE \nI just putter. \nSTEW \nHmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter? \nSMYTHE \nOh no, sir. I putter with me hands. \nSTEW \nWell, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it? \nSMYTHE \nWell sir, I'll show you. \nHe demonstrates, touching objects on a table and blowing dust off a lampshade. \nSMYTHE \nThat's puttering, sir. \nSTEW \nNo! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that? \nSMYTHE \nOh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it. \nSTEW \nOh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers? \nSMYTHE \nYes sir. \nSTEW \nOh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer. \nSMYTHE \nYes sir. \nSTEW \nHow about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer? \nSMYTHE \nYou sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir. \nSTEW \nWell, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer? \nSMYTHE \nWell sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage. \nSTEW \nA bird in a gilded cage? \nSMYTHE \nYes. \nSTEW \nThat's all I wanted to know! \nStew rushes off upstairs. Smythe gives the echo one last try. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. STEW'S ROOM \n187. MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Stew makes a telephone call. \nSTEW \nHello, Gallagher old pal. How are you, old pal? \nINT. GALLAGHER'S ROOM - NIGHT \n188. MEDIUM SHOT \nA simple room, probably in a boarding house or cheap hotel. Gallagher is on the phone. A typewriter stands nearby. \nGALLAGHER \nOh, hello Stew. I'm pretty good, can't complain. How's our gentleman of leisure? \nCONTINUATION SCENE 187 \nStew at phone. \nSTEW \nI'm on the coast of Norway and I can't get out - will you come and get me out of the coast of Norway? \nCONTINUATION SCENE 188 \n", "test2_id": 508, "test3_input": "It'll be ready in a minute. \nSTEW \n(accusingly) \nNever mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. \nGALLAGHER \n(in mock contrition) \nSorry, boss\u0097 \nSTEW \nDon't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all. \n219. INT. STEW'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT \nThere is a knock on the hall door. \nStew crosses and opens it. \n220. CLOSER SHOT \nAs Stew opens the door. It reveals Dexter Grayson in the little hallway, immaculately clad, as usual. Stew regards him in frank surprise for a moment. \nGRAYSON \nHello, Smith. \nSTEW \n(puzzled) \nHoly jumping swordfish! \nGRAYSON \nI suppose you know why I came\u0097? \nSTEW \nNo, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing. \nGRAYSON \nNow don't be absurd, Smith\u0097 \n(as he brushes past, walking inside) \nMay I come in? \nSTEW \nSurely, come right in. \nGRAYSON \n(as he sits down) \nThanks. May I sit down? \nSTEW \nSurely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle. \nGRAYSON \nI don't eat waffles. \nSTEW \nYou don't. \n221. MED. SHOT \nGrayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand Rapids chairs. Stew remains standing, and waits silently for Grayson to speak. Grayson clears his throat. \nGRAYSON \nAnne asked me to come and see you about the divorce. \nSTEW \n(with enlightened expression) \nShe did\u0097? \nGRAYSON \n(uncomfortably) \nShe wants me to arrange the financial settlement. \nSTEW \nListen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast. \nGRAYSON \n(interrupting) \nYou don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you. \n222. INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED. SHOT \nGallagher. Overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices, she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway and peeks out. \n223. MED. SHOT \nGrayson and Stew. \nGRAYSON \nWe should like to know how much you would want to\u0097 \nStew stares off incredulously. \nSTEW \n(interrupting) \nWait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony? \nGRAYSON \nThat's putting it crudely, but\u0097 \nStew starts advancing nervously toward him. Grayson, a bit alarmed, rises. \nSTEW \n(closing in on him) \nRemember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut. \nGRAYSON \nI beg your pardon. \nSTEW \nUnconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys. \n224. CLOSE SHOT \nShowing kitchen door open a crack. Gallagher's eyes are glistening as she watches and listens. \n225. MED. CLOSE SHOT \nStew and Grayson. \nGRAYSON \n(weakly) \n", "test3_true": "STEW \n(snaps) \nDon't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up! \nGrayson does so, completely intimidated by Stew's manner. Stew grabs him by the lapel. \nGRAYSON \nYes. \nSTEW \nAnd now for that twentieth crack\u0097 \nStew punches Grayson on chin and knocks him through the open door into the hall. \nHe slams door shut. \n226. WIDER SHOT \nStew thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks thoughtfully back to the typewriter. \n227. CLOSER SHOT \nStew standing staring down at the typewriter. He is still flushed with anger. Suddenly a thought strikes him, and his face breaks into a broad grin. He sits down quickly, and begins pounding away. \n228. MED. SHOT \nGallagher enters from the kitchen, carrying a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee pot. She sets them on a small table and this is spread with a cloth. Then she crosses over to Stew. \nGALLAGHER \n(pretending ignorance) \nWho was that? \nSTEW \n(without looking up from his typing) \nGrayson - Anne's lawyer. \nGALLAGHER \nWhat did he want? \nSTEW \nGallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act. \nThey sit at the little table. \n229. CLOSER SHOT \nGALLAGHER \nWhat was the idea he gave you? \nStew dives into the ham and eggs. \nSTEW \nIt's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this? The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh? \nGALLAGHER \nWell, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over. \n230. CLOSEUP - STEW \nHe looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar expression. \nSTEW \n(vehemently - as he scoops out some melon) \nWhat's the matter? Do you think I'm going to let that guy go back to his wife? Not on your life. He's got to go to the other girl. \n231. CLOSEUP - GALLAGHER \nShe almost drops her coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as she looks back at him. Gallagher tries hard to keep her voice steady. \nGALLAGHER \n(not sure of herself) \nWhat other girl\u0097? \n232. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO \nSTEW \nThe little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story. \nGALLAGHER \n(ecstatic, but still fighting) \nBut that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that. \nSTEW \nGallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play? \nGALLAGHER \nNo. \nSTEW \nThere's nothing sudden about that\u0097 \n(tensely) \nHe's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will \ngo to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you. \nHe gets to his feet, and comes around to her. \n233. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nGallagher watches him a bit uncertainly. \nSTEW \n(tenderly) \nHe goes to the little O'Brien gal and he says to her - in some pretty words of some kind - something that you can write - he'll say\u0097 \n(as if reading part - very emotional) \nDarling, I'm sorry. I've been a fool all my life. I've always loved you, only I didn't have sense enough to see it. As quick as I can get a divorce from my wife, I want you to marry me. Then she'll look at him that way - yeah - then they'll embrace, or something like that. \n(they draw closer) \nThen he'll kiss her, or something. \nTo demonstrate the point, Stew takes her in his arms and kisses her. They hold the kiss longer than is justified. Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion and clings to her desperately, while Gallagher's arms instinctively go around his neck. \nGallagher chokes back tears that persist in coming. She stifles a sob. Stew folds her in his arms. \nSTEW \n(tenderly) \nWhat's the matter, Gallagher? What's the matter? \nGallagher buries her face in his shoulders. \nFADE OUT. \nTHE END \nPlatinum Blonde Writers : \u00a0\u00a0Harry E. Chandlee\u00a0\u00a0Douglas W.

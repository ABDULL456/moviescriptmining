RONNIE So as you can see, the law is just one little call away. But I'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I'm gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself. 
Ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket.    He begins writing. 
RONNIE While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail. 
Ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie. 
The Skaters start cracking up. 
RONNIE You accepted it originally, so it still counts. 
Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh. 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY 
Ronnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him. Across the table sits NELL, a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform. The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed. 
NELL Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NELL (CONT'D) And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell. In Christ's name we pray, amen. 
RONNIE Amen. 
Ronnie begins devouring his Cinnabon. 
NELL So what's on the agenda for you today? 
RONNIE You know, the usual. Spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada. 
NELL What's wrong, Ronnie? 
RONNIE Nothing, Nell. 
NELL Ronnie, I know that you really want to be a Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to. 
RONNIE I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks, but really, I mean, I'm on the front lines right now. I'm livin' it. 
NELL Your job is definitely more exciting than mine. 
RONNIE Of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night. I better get going. 
NELL I'll see you after work, sweetie. 
Nell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this. And don't call me sweetie. 
NELL I'm sorry. I'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt. 
RONNIE 'Bye, Nell. 
Ronnie stands up and walks off. 
INT. MALL - DAY 
Ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning MALL WALKERS as they stride around the outer marked lane. It's all senior citizens. 
RONNIE Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down. 
Mark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie. 
MARK I've been looking all over for you. 
RONNIE I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up. 
MARK So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert. 
RONNIE For the love of God. 
MARK I know, it's horrible. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE You want me to phone this one in to the police? 
MARK Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly. 
RONNIE Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand you. You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own.

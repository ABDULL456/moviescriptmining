Brian shakes his head. 
BRIAN None. 
ON CARRIE 
In quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away. 
ON BRIAN AND EARLY 
Early stares at Brian. 
EARLY ...Well then, that's how many I killed. 
BRIAN (unconvincingly) If you say so. 
EARLY Damn right I do. 
ON ADELE 
Adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor. 
ON BRIAN AND EARLY 
Early picks up a different container and gulps some down. After a moment... 
EARLY You never killed anyone have you Bri'? 
Brian shakes his head no. 
EARLY You never even seen anybody killed, right? 
Brian stops eating and looks at Early. 
BRIAN What are you getting at? 
Early leans closer to him. 
EARLY You wanna tell me how'n the hell you gonna write a book 'bout somethin' you don't know nothin' 'bout? 
Eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. Brian has no answer. 
EARLY Ya see what I'm sayin'? (beat) Ha! 
BRIAN (nervously mimes the same) ...Ha. 
Early goes back to gulping down his dinner. This time he gets a spicy one. 
EARLY (a nod toward the carry out container) ...watch out for that stuff, it bites. 
Brian gazes at the cluster of Chinese carry-out food containers. An ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. He lets out a weak ironic laugh. 
BRIAN (recollecting to himself) ...way too much MSG. 
EXT. LINCOLN - TRAVELING - DAY 
INT. LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN BACKROADS - DAY 
Early is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. Adele sits beside him playing with her camera. She turns and aims the camera at Brian and Carrie in the back seat, their hands are bound. 
ADELE Smile. 
Neither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment then leans over to Early and whispers something to him. 
EARLY No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when I walked outta there. 
Adele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't. 
EARLY Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri? 
BRIAN Forget about it, doesn't matter. 
EARLY Hell it don't... (beat) ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table. 
NEW ANGLE 
Carrie silently fuming in the back seat. Brian stares at the rope that binds his wrists. 
EXT. OLD DESERTED MINE AREA - LATER THAT DAY 
The Lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. They all get out, Early unties Brian and Carrie. 
EARLY Figured your hands might be starting to hurt. 
Early looks down the hill to the old mine building. 
EARLY Let's have a look. You girls coming? 
Carrie's steely gaze answers Early's question. 
ADELE Can I just wait here? 
Early leans into the car and picks up Adele's camera. 
EARLY Don't worry Bri', I'll take the pictures. (to Adele, with a kiss to her cheek) ...you stay here with Carrie. (to Carrie) You run off... Bri' pays the price. Karma, remember?

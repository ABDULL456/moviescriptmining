{"test1_input": "JEN Put them down. \nGOVERNESS I heard you met Shu Lien today. \nJEN Do you know her? \nGOVERNESS She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind. \nJen shoots her an angry look. \nJEN I'll socialize with whomever I please. \nGOVERNESS Don't invite danger into your father's house. \nShe's about to say something, then thinks better of it. \nJEN I'm tired now. \nGOVERNESS Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring. \nJEN It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired. \nGOVERNESS Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you. \nThe governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed, thinking. \nEXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nA wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo, Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene. \nMASTER BO Chilly, eh? \nNIGHTMAN Yes, Master Bo. \nAs Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background. \nEXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT \nA masked figure silently opens the window and enters the room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and wraps the sword. \nBo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the roof as Bo yells out. \nBO Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on the roof!  The sword's been stolen! Stop thief!  Stop him! \nThe thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT \nBo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight. Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries towards the source. \nEXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nBo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter. \nTSAI It's Jade Fox! \nMAY We must avenge mother! \nThe hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over a wall, just as Bo arrives. \nBO Do something!  He's getting away! \nEXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the hooded figure face off. \nYU Return the sword, and I'll let you go. \nThe figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight. \nYu attacks, but the figure repels her. \nYU You've been trained at Wudan? \nThe figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series of lightning-quick blows. \nEXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nBo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away. \nTSAI You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing. \nMAY Father! \nBO You were rehearsing?  Who are you trying to fool? \nMay wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run off. \nBO Where did that thief go? \nBo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into Governor Yu's compound. \n", "test1_id": 213, "test2_input": "Lo grabs her by the wrist. \nJEN You shouldn't have come. \nLO With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there. \nJen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms again. \nJEN You've been looking for me all this time? \nFLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER \nINT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY \nJen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen admires the piece, her most prized possession. \nMadam Yu sits opposite her. \nMADAM YU Jen... stop playing with it. \nJen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the sky darkens. \nJEN I won't break it. \nEXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY \nLo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan. \nGUARD A It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is coming! \nHis warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords. \nMADAM YU Lower the shade, don't let them see you! \nDARK CLOUD (LO) Don't touch the women! \nThough unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand. \nShe bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse flails beside him. \nShe looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their escape on horseback. \nLO Let's go! \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \n", "test2_true": "LO Come get your comb. \nShe tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and flings her off her horse. \nLO Hurry back to your mother. \nLo rides on as she charges after her horse. \nEXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY \nA group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up, keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as she dismounts. \nOne of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few feet away. \nIn a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand. \nThe other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances, and charge her at once. \nIn a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back. \nLo calls out and stops the fight. \nLO She's mine. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nLo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about 20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In fact, they're dead tired. \nLO Let's stop a moment. \nJEN Give it back! \nLO (shouting a bit) You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here. \nHe dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed. \nLO Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning. \nJEN My comb! \nShe kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted, collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too. \nINT. CAVE - DAY \nJen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes. Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows. \n", "test2_id": 214, "test3_input": "YU Have some tea. \nAs Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch. Embarrassed, Li pulls back. \nLI Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. \nYU Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real? \nLI Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it. \nLi takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face. \nLI Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble. \nYU To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger. \nLI You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace. \nLi Mu Bai smiles. \nINT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY \nJen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her. \nWAITER Please follow me. \nJEN I want a clean room. \nWAITER We have plenty.  Your order? \nJen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down. \nJEN Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine. \nWAITER (dazed) I have to order from a bigger restaurant. \nJEN Hurry then. \nThe waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not much money left. \nA large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs. \nGIANG HU A That's him. \nMI BIAO I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true master has arrived.  I have come to seek a lesson. \n", "test3_true": "MI BIAO (bristles) You asked for it! \nMi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea. Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from the other men. \nJEN What kind of Iron Arm are you? \nFLYING MACHETE CHANG You have amazing technique!  I am Flying Machete.  Are you related to Southern Crane? \nJEN Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything with two feet.  Who could remember such long-winded names? \nGOU JUN SIHUNG Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and you don't know his master, Southern Crane? \nJEN Who are you? \nGOU JUN SIHUNG I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou. \nJEN (furious) Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou. You'll be the first to feel my sword today. \nJen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the powerful Green Destiny. \nMONK JING Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing? \nJEN A monk, in a place like this?  You need a lesson! \nMONK JING Who are you? \nShe smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing the Green Destiny. \nJEN Who am I?  I am... I am the Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed with the Incredible... Green Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern Crane... lower your head... and ask for mercy.  I am the desert dragon. I leave no trace.  Today I fly over Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over Wudan Mountain! \nJen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks. \nINT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY \nYu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who battled with Jen. \nFLYING MACHETE CHANG We politely asked for a friendly match, but she showed no respect, and attacked us.  Everyone came by to teach her a lesson. \nMI BIAO Her sword was just too powerful. \nMONK JING I've traveled everywhere, but never met anyone so uncivilized. \nSHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD (heavily bandaged) She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this Gou, anyway? \nYU Her husband. \n", "test3_id": 215}

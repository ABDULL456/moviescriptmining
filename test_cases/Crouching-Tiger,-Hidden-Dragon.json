{"train": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon \nby \nWang Hui Ling, James Schamus, Tsai Kuo Jung \nbased on the novel by \nWang Du Lu \nEXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY \nSecurity men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy. As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering the village.  One of the men recognizes him. \nWORKER Master Li is here! \nANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome. \nIn the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai, drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building. \nINT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY \nAunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls. \nAUNT WU Shu Lien! \nINT. YU'S ROOM - DAY \nYu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in. \nAUNT WU Li Mu Bai is here! \nINT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY \nLI How's everything? \nAUNT WU Fine.  Please come in. \nYu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a large object, wrapped in silk. \nYu smiles. \nYU Mu Bai...It's been too long. \nLI It has. (he glances around the room) How's business? \nYU Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times. \nLI First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness. \nYU Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking. \nLI Perhaps. \nEXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY \nCustoms officials have just finished checking the contents in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia. The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection. \nGUARDS Ok.  Pass. \nYU Thanks.  Let's go into the city. \nEXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY \nWorkers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages. Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of medicinal herbs. \nGIAO Everything got here safely.  I'm much obliged. \nYU Just doing my job. \nGIAO Sun Security has been the best since your father started it. You're a credit to his memory. \nYU Thank you. \nGIAO I mean it. \nEXT. DAY. PEKING \nFrom a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by the morning sun. \nEXT. PEKING STREET. DAY \nDusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages are fighting to get through the boulevards. \nA group of jugglers perform at a corner. \nYu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse. \nINT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY \nYu presents the sword to Sir Te. \nYu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands. \nJEN It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal! \nYU The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it. \nJEN But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful. \nYU Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old. \nJEN Exquisite!  You said it belongs to... \nYU My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift. \nJEN Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te? \nYU You're too young to understand. \nJEN You're a sword fighter too? \nYu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed. \nYU Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword. \nJEN Really? \nYu puts the sword back in the case. \nJEN (longingly) It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free! \nYU Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long. \nJEN I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way! \nYU Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is. \nJEN But you're just like the characters in the stories. \nYU Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books? \nJEN You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want. \nYU So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it? \nJEN You're not married, are you? \nJEN Put them down. \nGOVERNESS I heard you met Shu Lien today. \nJEN Do you know her? \nGOVERNESS She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind. \nJen shoots her an angry look. \nJEN I'll socialize with whomever I please. \nGOVERNESS Don't invite danger into your father's house. \nShe's about to say something, then thinks better of it. \nJEN I'm tired now. \nGOVERNESS Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring. \nJEN It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired. \nGOVERNESS Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you. \nThe governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed, thinking. \nEXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nA wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo, Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene. \nMASTER BO Chilly, eh? \nNIGHTMAN Yes, Master Bo. \nAs Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background. \nEXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT \nA masked figure silently opens the window and enters the room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and wraps the sword. \nBo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the roof as Bo yells out. \nBO Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on the roof!  The sword's been stolen! Stop thief!  Stop him! \nThe thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street. \nBO Governor Yu's house! \nEXT. ROOF TOP \nYu and the Black Figure continue to fight. \nYU Get down here!  Give back the sword! \nEXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT \nYu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief. A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu. She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity to get away. \nYu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the empty courtyard. \nEXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY \nDe Lu escorts Yu into Te's. \nDE LU Sir Te awaits you. \nINT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY \nMen are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of what happened, as Yu enters. \nBO I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household. \nSIR TE How dare you imply? \nBO But I say -- \nSIR TE -- Enough. \nThe men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration. \nYU Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword? \nSIR TE Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this. \nYU But the sword could be in his compound. \nSIR TE Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai. \nEXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nMadam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a wall across the street. \nINT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nInside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going through their belongings. \nImmediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his throat. \nTSAI Who are you? \nBO Wait!  I'm a friend! \nTsai pauses. \nINT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) \nMay fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight. \nTSAI I don't care about your sword. \nBO Why were you spying on the Yus? \nTSAI I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her. \nBO This Jade Fox is a woman? \nTSAI Yes. \nBO Then leave her to me. \nTSAI Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me. \nMAY It's ready! (re: the soup) \nBO I'm ready for anything! \nBo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts him with her own chopsticks. \nMAY Father gets first dip. \nTsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with a note.  Bo jumps up. \nTSAI They're gone. \nMAY What does it say? \nTSAI \"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill.\"  Good, the fox is out of her hole. \nYU No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods. \nLI That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword. \nYU What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it? \nLI I don't know it was stolen until I got here. \nYU Then, why did you come? \nLI Well, we had talked... \nDe Lu enters. \nDE LU Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li, your room is ready. \nLI Thank you.  Please lead the way. \nEXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT \nTsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a yawn. \nBO The fox doesn't care much for punctuality.  Still no sign of her. \nAn old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances. \nTSAI Enough!  Show yourself. \nThe old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess. \nFOX Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for your stubbornness. \nBO That's what you think, old witch! \nTSAI If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead. \nMAY Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death. \nFOX You'll soon end up like her, you little whore! \nBO You'll pay for that! \nA fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when the opportunity presents itself. \nTSAI (to Bo) She's going to paralyze you! \nMay drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head. Bo kneels beside her. \nMAY Father! \nEXT. TE'S - DAY \nTe and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them. \nTE This is Tsai? \nMAY My father.  Police Inspector from Shaan. \nTE This should be reported to Governor Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound. \nYU I'd bet my life on it! \nTE (to Li and Yu) Come with me. \nHe exits the room. \nINT. TE'S STUDY - DAY \nTe, Li, and Yu are seated. \nSIR TE This needs to be resolved, and quickly. \nLI I'll get into the Yu household and get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and her gang. \nYU We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble. \nSIR TE This is a delicate matter. \nYU Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? \nSIR TE What do you have in mind? \nYU The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs. \nSir Te and Li look puzzled. \nEXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY \nYu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with various items for her trousseau. \nMADAM YU Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate. \nLI Congratulations. \nEXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMay opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard. \nMAY Why don't you come in? \nBO I'm standing guard. \nMAY Come in.  It's cold. \nShe turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him. \nMAY Come in.  We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together. \nEXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT \nA still, dark night. \nEXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT \nSomething moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down. \nLi Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward. \nLI Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? \nFIGURE I do as I please. \nThe masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with incredible speed and grabs the sword from her. \nLI Where's your master? \nFIGURE What's it to you? \nThe figure floats away.  Li chases after her. \nEXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT \nThe two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops, displaying amazing floating skills. \nINT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT \nThe figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already there. \nJen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing. \nFOX You're home late... or should I say early? \nJEN Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family. \nFOX They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule. \nJEN I'll never live as a thief! \nFOX You're already a thief. \nJEN That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go? \nFOX Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father. \nJEN Shut up! \nFOX It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it? \nJEN I owe you nothing. \nFOX Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple. \nJen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the room. \nJEN You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols! \nFOX I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details! \nJEN You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you. \nFOX If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me. \nJEN Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from. \nFOX Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you! \nFox exits. \nEXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY \nThe Governess leaves, a small sack over her back. \nEXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY \nLo grabs her by the wrist. \nJEN You shouldn't have come. \nLO With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there. \nJen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms again. \nJEN You've been looking for me all this time? \nFLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER \nINT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY \nJen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen admires the piece, her most prized possession. \nMadam Yu sits opposite her. \nMADAM YU Jen... stop playing with it. \nJen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the sky darkens. \nJEN I won't break it. \nEXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY \nLo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan. \nGUARD A It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is coming! \nHis warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords. \nMADAM YU Lower the shade, don't let them see you! \nDARK CLOUD (LO) Don't touch the women! \nThough unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand. \nShe bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse flails beside him. \nShe looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their escape on horseback. \nLO Let's go! \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nLO If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow.  Great for hunting wild chicken.  They're delicious. \nJen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but her legs betray her and she falls. \nLO You need to eat, understand?  Then you'll have the strength to fight. Understand? \nHe helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac. He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she starts to wolf it down. \nLO You're eating too fast.  Slowly. \nEXT. CAVE - DAY \nLo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles. \nJen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head. Lo passes out as Jen scurries away. \nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY \nJen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered. But soon she passes out. \nINT. CAVE - NIGHT \nJen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to find that her legs and hands are tied up. \nLO You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way. \nJEN You coward! \nLO Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name? \nJen spits at Lo. \nLO I didn't think the Hans had names like that. \nLater: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows. \nLater, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub. \nHe rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her. \nLO Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would already have done it.  You must be dying for a bath.  Fresh water's hard to get here.  But I managed to bring some up.  You can wear my clothes when you're done.  They're clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so you'll know where I am.  After the bath, you'll be calmer. \nJen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit. While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few passages.  Jen smiles. \nINT. CAVE - NIGHT \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nLo and Jen ride through a mountain pass. \nEXT. CLIFF - DAY \nLo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over, viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance. \nLO Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer. \nJEN Let them look. \nLO It is trouble for me. \nJen bites her lip. \nJEN Don't send me back! \nLO You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, \"A faithful heart makes wishes come true.\" \nINT. TENT - DAY \nJen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They embrace. \nJEN Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again. \nLO I will. \nJEN (smiling painfully) If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy. \nEXT. TENT - DAY \nJen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning light. \nEnd of flashback. \nINT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLO Wherever I went, someone always recognized me.  I really tried. Later, I heard you came to Peking. I was afraid I'd never see you again.  So I came.  I can't let you marry. \nJen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from outside the door. \nJEN (whispering) Go. \nLO Jen... \nYU Have some tea. \nAs Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch. Embarrassed, Li pulls back. \nLI Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. \nYU Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real? \nLI Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it. \nLi takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face. \nLI Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble. \nYU To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger. \nLI You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace. \nLi Mu Bai smiles. \nINT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY \nJen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her. \nWAITER Please follow me. \nJEN I want a clean room. \nWAITER We have plenty.  Your order? \nJen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down. \nJEN Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine. \nWAITER (dazed) I have to order from a bigger restaurant. \nJEN Hurry then. \nThe waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not much money left. \nA large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs. \nGIANG HU A That's him. \nMI BIAO I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true master has arrived.  I have come to seek a lesson. \nThe men all nod their heads. \nEXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY \nLi and Yu ride together. \nLI (to Yu) We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in. \nYU What about you? \nLI I'll look around and catch up later. \nYU Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters. \nYu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the darkening sky. \nEXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY \nA group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters. \nSECURITY MAN A Mistress, you're back. \nYU It's you!  How's everything here? \nCAPTAIN Fine.  You've been gone a while. \nYU Yes, and I leave again tomorrow. Your wife was due? \nAH WAI Yeah, a baby girl. \nYU Good! \nAH WAI I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you. \nYU Mrs. Wu... \nAUNT WU You're back! \nYU How's the arm?  Still sore? \nAUNT WU Much better.  You've been gone so long. \nYU Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night. \nAUNT WU (excited) I'll go and make up his room! \nJen jumps out. \nINT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY \nJen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are still practicing. \nThey raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder. \nYU (calling out) Jen! \nJen greets Yu with the Green Destiny. \nYU Everyone out.  Shut the doors. \nThe men leave. \nYU Fine... the friendship is over. \nYu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with Jen. \nYu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none are any match for the Green Destiny. \nAfter slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands. \nYU Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword. \nJEN Come and get it if you can. \nYU Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing. \nJEN Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead. \nYu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls back. \nYU Give me the sword. \nJen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm. \nJEN Take it! \nYu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in. \nLI (enraged) Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny. \nJEN Not another lecture!  On guard! \nBo is burying Fox in the rain. \nEXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them. \nJEN Where is Mrs. Wu? \nAunt Wu comes running out. \nAUNT WU Stop it! \nJen pulls out Yu's comb. \nJEN Shu Lien told me to show you this. \nAUNT WU Let her in. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT \nYu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational, eerily calm. \nYU Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope... \nLI Shu Lien... \nYU Save your strength. \nLI My life is departing.  I've only one breath left. \nYU Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me. \nLI I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit. \nYu cries. \nShe kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes. \nEXT. PATH - DAY \nAs the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine in her hands. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nLi is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead. \n", "test1_input": "GOVERNESS This spells trouble. \nJEN I have a guest. \nThe governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in. \nMAID This way please. \nThe governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess bows slightly and departs. \nJEN I've missed you. \nYU How so? \nJEN I'm bored. \nYu sees the calligraphy. \nYU You're doing calligraphy? \nJEN I'll write your name.  Just for fun. \nJen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness. \nYU I never realized my name looks like \"sword.\" \nJen freezes slightly. \nYU You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing. \nJEN Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know. \nThe maid enters with tea. \nJEN Please. \nYU Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations. \nJEN I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. \nYU You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family. \nJEN Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness. \nYU Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story. \n", "test1_true": "YU Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married? \nJEN No, really? \nYU His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it. \nJEN Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's. \nYU I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties. \nJEN Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters. \nYU Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage. \nEXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY \nThe maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a corner. \nINT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMoonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face dissolves, into... \nINT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY \n...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback, that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant. \nMADAM YU What a godforsaken place!  Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization?  Jen... are you listening to me? \nJen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a beautiful mountainside. \nINT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJen sighs, and turns back toward her bed. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nTsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a tree, watching Jen. \nTSAI Let's go! \nThey drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop, Lo looks silently on. \nEXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nTsai and May enter the house. \n", "test2_input": "LO Come with me to the desert!  Jen! Come with me to Xin Jiang! \nThe guards surround Lo, but he escapes. \nEXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY \nLo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the corner and sees them. \nLI Where is Jade Fox? \nYu jumps in and pushes Li away. \nYU (to Lo) Come with me!  Hurry! \nINT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY \nLo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who look him over. \nYU (to Lo) You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you? \nLO She's mine. \nLI Either way, you are no good to her dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands. \nLO I don't care anymore. \nLI If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that. \nYU Don't you want to see her again. \nLI All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me. \nLO All right. \nEXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT \nYu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look. Li shrugs. \nINT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT \nA crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty sword case, his voice rising. \nSIR TE When will this end?  They take it, they put it back, they take it again.  My home is turning into a warehouse. \nBo bursts into the hall, bows to Te. \n", "test2_true": "BO Jen has run away!  Gou found the wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu requests your assistance.  You know the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants to find her, and keep her from harm. \nLI Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't worry. \nINT. TEA STALL - DAY \nJen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu martial arts characters sitting nearby. \nWAITRESS What can I serve you? \nAs the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm. \nJEN The cup is dirty. \nThe flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away. The men approach Jen. \nGANGSTER A Hello.  What is your name? \nJEN (without lifting her eyes) Long. \nGANGSTER B It's young Master Long.  My apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms, Flying Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to Huai An, and where are you headed, Master Long? \nJEN Anywhere there's action. \nThe two men exchange glances. \nGANGSTER A In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance. \nJEN Don't bother. \nGANGSTER A You don't seem to understand. \nJEN So what if I don't? \nGANGSTER B We have ways of helping you understand. \nThe two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped into scraps by Jen. \nGANGSTER A (stunned) Are you related to Li Mu Bai? \nJEN He is my defeated foe! \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nLi and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the horses in the background. \n", "test3_input": "Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nIt's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious. \nFOX Sooner or later, they'd drag you back to Peking.  Your parents will never accept you again.  But why go home?  We've gone this far, we won't stop now.  You'll always be my lady.  At last, we'll be our own masters.  We'll be happy.  That's the most important thing.  All we have left is each other, right? Lie down and rest. \nJen is too weak to respond. \nFox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny. \nEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nFox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something, but she keeps moving. \nINT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY \nAunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu. \nAUNT WU She's crazy.  You should have killed her. \nYU I didn't have the heart. \nAUNT WU Well, Li Mu Bai can do it. \nYu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees Jade Fox in the distance. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nJen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up, and walks into the rain. \nEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nJen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling. \nJEN Is it me or the sword you want? \nJen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes. \nLI You've been drugged! \nLi carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \n", "test3_true": "LI Where is Jade Fox? \nJen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu looks at Jen. \nYU What happened? \nLI Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here? \nYU We followed Jade Fox. \nInstantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all, sending them flinging hither and thither. \nFox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding to death. \nLI And so you die. \nLi touches his neck. \nFOX And so shall you! \nLi pulls a single needle from his neck. \nYU A poisoned needle! \nFOX You deserve to die, but the life I was hoping to take... was Jen's. Ten years I devoted to you.  But you deceived me!  You hid the manual's true meaning.  I never improved... but your progress was limitless!  You know what poison is? An eight-year-old girl, full of deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My only family... my only enemy... \nJade Fox dies. \nYU You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die! \nJEN She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart. \nLI My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote. \nYU That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this? \nJEN The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you. \nLI All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can. \nYU (takes the comb from her hair) Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry! \nJEN Spare your energy.  I'll be back! \nEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT \n"}

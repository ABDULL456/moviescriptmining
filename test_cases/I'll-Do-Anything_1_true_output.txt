As they look to the phone and react--still joined, then: 
JEANNIE'S VOICE (sobbing) Daddy... (berating someone who is with her) You dialed bad... Where is he? 
LUCY'S VOICE (with Jeannie coaching b.g.) Matt, Jeannie is very upset because you are not here when you said. And now the big hand is on the eight... 
The sound of a hangup... As Matt springs from the bed. 
MATT I'm sorry... 
CATHY It's all right. 
MATT (as he leaves) Is there a name for what we just had? 
INT. BURKE'S CAR - DAY 
Matt driving. Burke in back as his anxieties gnaw away. 
MATT This is awkward, my driving you around and testing for you tomorrow. 
BURKE Not really. 
MATT Well, I hope you understand I can't drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test. It's just... 
Burke reluctantly considers, then: 
BURKE Okay. I was going to come in late anyway. I'll get one of the kids to drive me. 
MATT Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead in this movie, you'll have to go back to sitting up front with me. 
Burke laughs--surprised at being genuinely amused. 
INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Matt, wildly dialing a phone--orange juice in hand, Jeannie standing nearby. He shrieks one phrase. 
MATT (into phone) No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving now. 
INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - DAY 
Matt is in the final process of being made up, going over his lines. Cathy enters. 
CATHY Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch of kids in the building. She's fascinated. And they're all ready for you. 
MATT How many men are they testing today? 
CATHY You're the only one. 
Matt is surprised... But he is a pro and so immediately makes use of this sudden blip in status. 
MATT Then tell them I need a little more time. 
MAKE-UP PERSON No, it's okay, we're done. 
MATT I mean for me. I want to focus a little. 
CATHY Sure. (she hugs Matt) Good luck, Matt. (whispered advice) The thing they're looking for most is sexy. 
And then they're gone. With that bit of advice, Matt is totally fucked up. A beat after Cathy leaves: 
HAIR PERSON You know who she was involved with for a minute or so? 
MAKE-UP PERSON Who? 
MATT (quickly) Hey! 
On their look... 
MATT (again) You guys have to leave. This is important and I need to be alone right now... 
They exit... Matt thumbs through the script... does a relaxation exercise... takes a breath and thinks... a beat and he is reasonably confident... he walks one half-circle of the room making sure he's fully pumped, then exits. 
EXT. POPCORN MOVIES - DAY 
As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but this time they are reading children of varied ages, and the kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc. Jeannie is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy, as she makes her way through this world of the young, clinging to Cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of "MAKE BELIEVE"--the stage parents taking one verse. At one point, Cathy's begins talking to someone, blocking Jeannie's view. 
JEANNIE Get out of my way! 
CATHY Don't say it like that!!! 
JEANNIE Which way should I? (polite little girl) Get out of my way. (almost weeping) Get out of my way. (furious) Get out of my way. 
All this noticed by a casting person with a clipboard.

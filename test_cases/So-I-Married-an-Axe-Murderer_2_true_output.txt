CHARLIE (sniffing it) Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take some to the office tomorrow. (running into bathroom) I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right back. 
Charlie goes into the bathroom. 
CHARLIE'S BATHROOM 
Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass down on the counter. 
HARRIET I'm gonna take a quick shower. 
Charlie notices the empty glass on the counter. 
CHARLIE Harriet, where did the shake go? 
HARRIET What do you care? I drank it. (getting into shower) You could have at least tried it. You make me feel bad sometimes, Charlie. I don't know why. 
With her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and checks the trash can. Nothing. Then he runs around the bed to the other trash can. Nothing. 
He looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing a towel. She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the covers. He gets into bed next to her. She gives him a kiss. 
HARRIET Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You didn't want to drink my milkshake. So what -- right? 
NEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Regarding the murder between the two partners, we talked to Toxicologist Dr. Show on the issue. 
Charlie and Harriet are watching the news show. DOCTOR SHOW is patched in via the Anchorman's close circuit TV. 
NEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Doctor, is it possible that one could be poisoned with no trace at all? 
DOCTOR SHOW (ON TV) Certainly. There are plants that grow very commonly in our own backyard that could easily be fermented into poison. Take for instance the... 
CHARLIE (getting nervous; blocking out TV) Harriet, why don't we shut the light off. 
NEWS ANCHORMAN (ON TV) Really? And how easy it that to do? 
DOCTOR (ON TV) Scarily enough, quite simple. You merely take the... 
CHARLIE (blocking out the TV again) Maybe we should turn the light back on. Yeah that's better. 
HARRIET Charlie, what's the matter? 
CHARLIE Nothing. 
HARRIET Charlie... 
CHARLIE Well, it's just... (re: the TV) The TV. You can't even watch the news these days without getting depressed. 
HARRIET I know, Charlie. And it's not just that. Look at the things people are doing. Partners killing each other... I mean, you hear a story like that, and... who can you really trust these days? 
CHARLIE What do you mean? 
HARRIET It's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, "What if I pushed him?" 
CHARLIE Well, I don't really take the subway ever, so... 
Charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him. 
HARRIET I'm just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives. I mean, look at us. If you didn't trust me, you would never be able to fall asleep. 
CHARLIE Why do you say that? 
HARRIET Look at you, you're sleeping. Look how vulnerable you are. I mean, I could do anything at that point. 
CHARLIE (nervous) What could you do? 
HARRIET (sweet and innocent) Anything. You're lying on your side, asleep, I could... stick a needle in your ear. 
CHARLIE (grabbing his ear at the thought) Aahhh! 
HARRIET I'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. Goodnight, sweetheart. 
He looks very uneasy. She kisses him and shuts off the light. The moon gives the room an eerie glow.

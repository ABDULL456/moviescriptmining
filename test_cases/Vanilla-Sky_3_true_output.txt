BRIAN Almost worth dying for. Pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled mass of the near-.accident. 
EXT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY 
David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL, his second assistant, at. the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames Publications. Aames hops out of car and heads into the building. 
INT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY 
David Aames Jr. turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine, a male youth-culture-style magazine. Rachel gives him daily tabloid reports, continues with the essentials. 
RACHEL The art department needs a decision on the colors. Yellow- and- red, or white? And the board is pissed you're late. 
DAVID You changed your hair. David taps on the window of the art department, in panic over several cover mock-ups. He gives a presidential thumbs-up, moves on. They look at each other, trying to decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision. 
ART EDITOR Did he mean the yellow-and-red or the white? David passes a holdover from the old days, older Receptionist       (BEATRICE) who speaks uncomfortably and gruffly into a headset. She gives David a knowing look - late again. 
RACHEL They're all waiting for you. And David - opinions are expected. 
A MAN'S VOICE Do you dream about the Board, David? The Seven Dwarves, as you call them? David walks into the office. Framed original photos from album covers co-mingle with a splash of cultured art and books. Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older Executives wait.

DAVID'S VOICE They still look at me like I was still eleven years old. 
FLASHBACK David at          11, blithely skateboarding the hallways. He passes Beatrice, who turns to an editor. 
BEATRICE He's going to inherit everything. He gets it all. if 
INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT     (INTERROGATION # 1) 
The light from a small line of chicken-wired windows cuts through the blackness. In the shadows of this dank room, we hear his voice but we do not see him. It is the smaller, slightly muffled tone of David Aames. In the shadows, he wears a mask. 
MCCABE You're scared of your dreams, aren't you? 
Portrait of CURTIS McCABE, 52.            Doctor of Psychiatry, prison division. He's far too wily to spend the currency of his brilliance just yet. It's too early in their relationship. He stands tall, leaning on a steel desk, polishing his glasses with end of his coat. 
DAVID It's a nightmare either way. 
MCCABE Is that how do you explain what's happened to you? 
DAVID What -- 
MCCABE What happened to your face? 
DAVID I'm not talking to you anymore. 
MCCABE And you don't want to show me your face. 
DAVID No. 
MCCABE Do you know why you're here? 
DAVID (sarcastic) The conversation, the coffee --

SCREEN IS BLACK In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete walls and dies away. Silence. SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN: 
1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1 
FRANK FARMER'S FACE - mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He is The Bodyguard. ANGLE - HIT MAN dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face down on the  cement floor. A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome, 50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There is no movement. The two men are lying near the right front fender of a black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still alert for any further threat. MAIN TITLES BEGIN. A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub- nosed .357 aimed at them. FRANK Freeze! ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.   Farmer lowers his weapon and speaks. FRANK (calm, but an order) Call 911. 
CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high, almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of the scene. It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness. 
2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2 
Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom. Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her song "I have Nothing." 
2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound. The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the care of a surgeon.

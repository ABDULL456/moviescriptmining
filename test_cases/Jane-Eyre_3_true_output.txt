Jane is staring out at the Autumn rain. She surreptitiously wipes her tears away and smiles up at Mary. 
JANE Have you something for me to do? 
MARY You are doing something already. May I see? 
Jane hands her a book. She has drawn a bride. 
JANE That's Miss Temple on her wedding day. She was my teacher; a great influence on me. Under her guidance I became a teacher too. 
Mary turns the page. It shows a sketch of St John Rivers. Mary gasps in delight. She takes the book straight to St John, who is diligently working at his desk. 
MARY St John - 
JANE No, Mary, please - 
MARY See how skilled Jane is. 
St John looks at the sketch of himself. He is quite taken aback. He looks over at Jane, who is quite embarrassed. 
MARY (CONT'D) She is better than any drawing master we have ever had. 
For a moment, St John seems to be weighing up whether to be insulted or not. 
ST JOHN How fierce I am, Miss Elliott. 
JANE Mr Rivers, I wondered if you had yet heard of any work that I could do. 
ST JOHN I found you a situation some days ago but I've delayed telling you because the work is lowly and I fear you'll scorn it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 28. 
JANE I shan't mind what I do. 
ST JOHN As I am poor and obscure, the help I can offer is of the meanest sort. 
DIANA St John, what are you going to offer her? Not washerwoman, I hope? 
ST JOHN When I took over the parish two years ago it had no school. I opened one for boys; I now intend to open one for girls. The school mistress will have a two-roomed cottage paid for by local benefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year. You can see how humble, how ignoble it is. 
On the contrary, Jane is deeply gratified. 
JANE Mr Rivers, I thank you heartily and I accept with all my heart. 
ST JOHN But you comprehend me? It's a village school - cottagers daughters. What will you do with all your fine accomplishments? 
JANE I will save them until they are wanted. They will keep. 
Jane smiles at him. St John is impressed. 
INT. DAY. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM. 
Jane is at the blackboard in a freshly painted school room. In front of her are about twenty village girls, aged from six to sixteen. They are hanging on her every word. 
Jane is writing a neat line of 'a's. 
INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE. 
Jane's first home is like a doll's house. She walks through it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed, through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the scullery kitchen. She retraces her steps back into the parlour. She turns round and surveys it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 29. 
Silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing of the wind. She feels glad, grateful, but very, very alone. She hears Brocklehurst's voice. 
BROCKLEHURST I hear you are to leave us, Miss Eyre. 
She spins around as if he is there. 
EXT. DAY. A CHURCHYARD. 
Brocklehurst is at the church door; Jane looking at him coldly. She holds a bunch of wild flowers. 
JANE Yes. Excuse me. 
She walks into the graveyard. There are over forty small graves marked with wooden crosses, each bearing a child's name. One of them says Helen Burns. Jane lays down her flowers. 
She looks up at Brocklehurst. He cannot meet her eye. 
We hear the voice of Mrs Fairfax. 
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) If Jane Eyre of Lowood School... 
INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE. 
Jane tries to quell her great unhappiness. She springs into action, straightening her furniture, stoking her fire. 
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) ...Who advertised in the Yorkshire Herald, possesses the acquirements mentioned... 
EXT. DAY. A ROADSIDE. 
Jane, younger and more hopeful, with her belongings in a small trunk, awaits an approaching public coach. 
MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) ...And if she is in a position to give satisfactory references, a situation can be offered where there is but one pupil, a little girl under ten years of age and where the salary is thirty pounds a year. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 30. 
EXT. DAY. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE.

JEANETTE (O.C.) No. It's a mess. 
ED Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you. 
After a pause, Jeanette enters, very camera-conscious. 
ED (CONT'D) (to the camera) This is my mother. 
STIFFLY, he gives her a kiss. 
ED (CONT'D) Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and -- 
JEANETTE Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. 
ED Hey, he cheated on her. 
JEANETTE He made a mistake. 
ED I don't want to -- do you know where he is? 
JEANETTE No. Maybe he's watching. (indicates the camera) Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. 
ED No! And that girl has a name. 
AL What do you love her or something? 
ED (embarrassed) Come on... 
AL (teasing) Look at your face. I had a car that color.

JEANETTE (unconvinced) Mm. 
ED You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left. 
JEANETTE (looks at the TV) Oh my God!

CUTS OF VARIOUS VIEWERS WATCHING REAL TV 
End on TAD and BARRY in a health club. This is the refreshment area. They've played racquetball and they're sweaty. They're watching Real TV. 
TAD I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die. 
BARRY What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?" 
TAD You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing. 
BARRY This is real, Bananahead!

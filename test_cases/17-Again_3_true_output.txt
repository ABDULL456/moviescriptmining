The Bras' jaws hit the floor. Mike walks off, a huge grin on his face. Man, that felt good. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY 
Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a TRAY, scans the crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table ALONE. It's a heartbreaking image. Mike approaches- 
MIKE Mind if I sit here? 
ALEX Mark?    You look totally different. 
Mike sits across from Alex. 
MIKE I got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead. 
ALEX Could you move to the left a little? 
Mike inches left, peeks behind him...2 girls eat lunch together. The one facing them is a cute Latino, NICOLE, 16. 
Nicole smiles.    Alex quickly shies away. 
MIKE Who's she? 
ALEX Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish class. 
MIKE Have you spoken to her? 
ALEX No. I get all stupid so I just stare. 
MIKE I'll tell you a funny story. The first time I met your mother I was so nervous- 
ALEX My mother? 
MIKE What? 
ALEX You said, `the first time I met your mother I was so nervous...' 
MIKE I did?    That's weird.   Is your mom hot? 
ALEX Dude. 
MIKE What's going on tonight?    You wanna hang out? Do something? 
ALEX Really? 
MIKE Yeah you could show me around. 
ALEX Cool. 
The Wonder Bras sway in, take seats at the VIP table. 
MIKE I'll swing by your house around 7. 
Mike rises. 
ALEX I wouldn't go over there. Stan and his Baboons have lunch this period. 
MIKE Don't worry. I'll see you tonight. 
Mike strolls over to the Bras' table, plunks himself down. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa Etheridge jammed- 
SAMANTHA -You're so rude!? We're not gay. We like boys. 
JAMIE Yeah, Samantha's a total slu... 
Samantha's jaw drops. 
LAUREN Last New Year's Samantha made it with my boyfriend. 
SAMANTHA I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't believe you keep bringing that up. 
The Bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves. Mike pulls out his new iPhone, plugs the earphones in his ears. 
The Bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone.

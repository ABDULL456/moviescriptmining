Utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield. Where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DESERT AIRSTRIP 
TIGHT ON A turbo-prop engine ROARING. 
WIDER reveals a big Cessna twin.  The PILOT, a weaselly guy we haven't seen before, fires up the second engine. The plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light. A desert airstrip near Palmdale.  A couple of aluminum- siding hangers and no tower.  A few other planes around but no activity besides Bodhi's rock-steady crew. 
UTAH watches Grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of Bodhi's truck and starts tossing out PARACHUTE PACKS. Roach tosses one to Bodhi, who chucks it to Utah. 
BODHI Ever done this before? 
UTAH Once. 
BODHI Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump. 
UTAH Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday-- 
BODHI Yeah, I noticed you limping. (grins) But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land! 
Bodhi grabs his sleeve, ushering him into the plane. 
UTAH Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel so much better. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CESSNA 
Utah sits, wearing a day-glo jump suit, hugging the chute in his lap.  Next to him is the gaping door.  Beyond... a spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet.  ROAR of wind and engines. 
Utah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling into their colorful freefall suits.  Nathaniel pulls on a pair of purple shorts over his suit.  Looks real dorky. Grommet has on duck feet.  Bodhi, apparently, is going to jump barefoot. Nobody has their chutes on yet. Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the contents.  His brain is racing.  Bodhi shouts over the roar. 
BODHI It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar. 
UTAH So, who... uh, who packed my chute? 
BODHI I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me? 
UTAH You gotta earn trust. 
BODHI Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine. 
Bodhi swaps chutes with Johnny. Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly. Is this a game?  Poker moves? Did Bodhi anticipate this step? 
ROACH Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man. His pack-jobs suck... they only open half the time.  Take Grommet's, man. 
Roach's grin is evil as he grabs Grommet's chute out of his hands and switches it with Johnny's.  Keeps that one and gives his to Grommet. 
GROMMET Whoa, unfair, dude! 
Grommet grabs his chute back and hands Johnny the one he had, which was Roach's.  I think. Johnny looks at the pack in his hands.  Then at the grinning faces. Russian surfer freefall roulette.  Shit. Bodhi studying him.  Some kind of test. Fuck it.  Utah starts putting the damn thing on. 
UTAH We gonna jump or jerk off? 
BODHI My man! 
EXT.  10,000 FEET - DAWN 
Multi-colored figures explode from the plane.  Leaping into freefall.  Tumbling end over end. WEARING HEADSETS, they hurtle downward. 
BODHI (RADIO) Utah, you copy bruddah? 
UTAH (RADIO) Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah! 
BODHI I'll take that as a yes. 
One by one they stabilize.  Falling face down, knees bent, they angle their hands and feet minutely to move laterally.  Utah flails, the last to trim out.  But he's holding his own. 
Grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive.  He flares out and "flies" back to the others. Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on a separate plane of existence. A hurricane of wind.  Wild HOOTING. Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel, falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube in the pool. 
ROACH Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with the cosmos!

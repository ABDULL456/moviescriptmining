GUIDE VOICE It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. \nA small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The dolphin stadium at Sea World. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate. \nThe dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means. \nThey leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher... \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" but in fact the message was this... \"So long and thanks for all the fish.\" \nTITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES) \nDolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles. Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a Buzby Berkley-style song called, \"SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH.\" We end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the dolphins have vanished. \nEND TITLES \nAs night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then... \nVOICE ON RADIO ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight. \nCUT TO: \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \nINT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2 \nCLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates. A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room. \n3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3 He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES O.S. \n4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4 \nArthur sets the newspaper (with the headline \"DOLPHINS VANISH\") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS. \nHe pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia) at a costume party. \nHe presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he sees the bulldozers. \nThe tea cup shatters on the floor. CUT TO: 5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5 \nArthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his house. He yells into his mobile phone. \nARTHUR (into phone) What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast! \nMR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him. \nPROSSER Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever. \nARTHUR I'm game. We'll see who rusts first. \nPROSSER This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago. \nARTHUR The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me. (CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \nCONTINUED:                                                   5 \nThe bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase. \nPROSSER Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year. \nARTHUR On display? I had to go down to a cellar! \nPROSSER That's the display department. \nARTHUR I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'. \nPROSSER Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you? \nARTHUR How much? \nPROSSER None at all. \nFORD (O.S.) (American accent) Arthur! \n(6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB:                                      (6 cont) \nFORD Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car? \nARTHUR I assumed you were drunk. \nFORD (shaking his head) I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself. \nARTHUR And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies? \nFORD (nodding) You saved my life that day.      Now I'm saving yours. \nArthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer. \nARTHUR This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays. \nFORD Look, if it's about your house... \nARTHUR No, it's not that.    It's.... \nHe shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about? \nFORD This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes. \nArthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch. \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \nCONTINUED: (2)                                                  6 \nFORD (CONT'D) Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party. \nARTHUR At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember? \nFLASHBACK TO: \n8   INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT                                     8 \nCrowded flat.    Everyone is in costume.   Loud music BLARES. \nARTHUR (V.O.) I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don't know, brush the dog. Anything. But there I was -- and then, there she was... \nArthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet, sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable. \nTRICIA (O.S.) Who are you? \nArthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid 19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands. \nARTHUR I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent. \nTRICIA No, I mean who are you? \nARTHUR Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um... (sheepishly tipping his hat) Livingston, I presume. (pointing to her attire) Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice. \nTRICIA You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock. \nARTHUR Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \nCONTINUED:                                                    8 \nARTHUR Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. \nHe pets the dog.    She smiles.    He smiles back. \n9   A CAMERA FLASH FLASHES.    JUMP CUT to...                     9 \nTHE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen image and laugh. \nARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology... \nTRICIA I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that! \nThey clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat. \nARTHUR (V.O.) And just as I was asking myself, \"Why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says... \nTRICIA Let's go somewhere. \nARTHUR Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner... \nTRICIA I was thinking Madagascar. \nARTHUR Is that a new club on Dean Street? \nTRICIA No. It's a country.    Off the coast of Africa. \nARTHUR Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then. (then realizing...) Good God, you're serious. \nPicture mission control in Houston. WORKERS scramble. Monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports from around the globe; panic, chaos and pandemonium. \nSuddenly, there's a loud HUM through the speakers, followed by loud GARGLES and SCREECHING. Then... \nJELTZ {THROUGH SPEAKERS) People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning council. \n13       INT. A SUBURBAN BREAKFAST ROOM. CONTINUOUS                   13 \nA FAMILY at breakfast, baffled that their cutlery, bowls and glasses resonate with the sound of Jeltz's voice. \nJELTZ (VOICE ONLY) As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system... \n14       EXT. OXFORD STREET ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS            14 \nSeveral PATRONS watch the wall of TV's, all projecting a snowy, distorted image. Jeltz's voice blares through the speakers. \nJELTZ ...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you. \nThrough the window behind them, throngs of people stampede down Oxford Street, screaming. \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n5   EXT. SATELLITE TRACKING STATION                               15 \nA TECHNICIAN speaks urgently into a microphone while his co-workers watch the chaos on the monitors behind. \nTECHNICIAN Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond! \n16      INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS               16 \nThe VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda. \nJELTZ (INTO THE P.A.) There's no point in acting all surprised about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints. \n17      EXT. FIELD BY ARTHUR'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS                      17 \nFord grabs hold of Arthur's shirt, extends the Thumb. \n18      INT. THE PUB. CONTINUOUS                                      18 \nPULL BACK FROM JUKE BOX.     The pub seems deserted. \nVOGON CAPTAIN (through juke box) What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout. \nPULL BACK FARTHER - people lay on the ground with PAPER BAGS on their heads. \n19      INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE. -- CONTINUOUS             19 \nJeltz turns.   He's large, green and walrusy. \nJELTZ Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams. \nOne of his walrusy FIRST OFFICERS pushes a yellow button. \n20      BIG SHOT.   FROM SPACE.    LOOKING DOWN ON EARTH              20 \nAs all the Vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light. Glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward Earth. On impact, they bore into the surface. \nJELTZ (O.S.) Detonate. \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n0   CONTINUED:                                                  20 \nLike a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses in on itself. Gone. \nThe Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS. \n21      Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we       21 see that it says...\"THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.\" \nGUIDE VOICE The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book... \nThe title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. \nThe book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations... \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON, ANYWAY? \nNow the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book \"presents itself\" like some hi-tech infomercial. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words \"DON'T PANIC\" printed in large friendly letters on its cover. \nThe book closes. The words \"DON'T PANIC\" appear just below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee. \nPULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face. \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n2   INT. HOLD OF VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP - NIGHT                        22 \nArthur, in total shock, holds up the guide. \nFORD (CONT'D) We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull. \nThey both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe. \nARTHUR What's a Vogon? \nFORD Ask the guide.    Say \"Vogons.\" \nFord continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide. \nARTHUR \"Vogons.\" \nThe word \"VOGONS\" floats up into his field of vision. \nGUIDE VOICE Vogons. \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n5   CONTINUED: (2)                                              25 \nCHARACTER, HISTORY, HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH, HOW TO ANNOY, WHAT TO AVOID. Arthur touches CHARACTER. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. \nArthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.' \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat. \nArthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you. \nFORD They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things. (turns dial opposite direction) And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty. \nARTHUR It can't be gone. It can't be! (grabbing the Guide, shouting} Earth! \nFORD Shhh! \nARTHUR EARTH!! \nGUIDE VOICE Earth. \nAn image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Harmless. \nArthur waits...and waits.    The Earth image fades away. \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n5   CONTINUED: (3)                                                25 \nARTHUR That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? \"Harmless?\" \nFORD Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded. \nARTHUR What does it say now? \nFORD Mostly harmless. \nBefore Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears. \nARTHUR Ahhh, what the hell is that?! \nFORD Here.   Put this in your ear. \nFord removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles. \nARTHUR WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH... \nThe LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to get the fish in Arthur's ear. \nJELTZ (ON SPEAKER) \nARTHUR Argh!   What's happening...? \nAs he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's voice. Arthur looks incredulous. \nJELTZ (ON SPEAKER) This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention! \nFORD The fish. It's translating for you. \nJELTZ (ON SPEAKER) According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and... \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n5   CONTINUED: (4)                                                25 \nArthur doesn't want to hear any of this...pulls the fish back out of his ear. \nJELTZ Continue. . . \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n7   CONTINUED: (2)                                                27 \nARTHUR And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity... \nFORD Vogonity! \nARTHUR ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er... \nFORD ... whatever it was ... \nARTHUR ... the poem was about. \nJeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly. \nFORD Damn. \nARTHUR What? \nFORD I think you just saved my life again. \nJELTZ An astute analysis. Very impressive. (turning to the Guard) Throw them off the ship. \nThe guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge. \nVOGON GUARD Resistance is useless! \nJELTZ Hmph. \"Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor...\" Death's too good for them. \nJeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab. \n28      INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER                     28 \nThe Guard shoves them into the airlock. \n29      INT.

We're going to die? \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n9   CONTINUED:                                                     29 \nFORD Yes. No, wait! What's this switch? (reaching for it) No, it's nothing. We are going to die. \nArthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself. \nARTHUR You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young. \nFORD Why? What did you she tell you? \nARTHUR I don't know. I didn't listen. \nFord folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help? \nFORD You're sweating. \nFord dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then -- PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out. \n30      EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS                                   30 \nFord and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket. \nGUIDE VOICE \"Space...\" says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, \"...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space...\" and so on. \nThe weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it. The words \"DON'T PANIC\" alight. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against... \n(CONTINUED) \nHHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n0   CONTINUED:                                                       30 \nSomething else falls out of his pocket -- his digital phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress party. \nGUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to connect with. \nHe reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips. His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away. \n30a     Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny        30a hole appears, then opens wide.

She smiles and gives him a friendly embrace. \nARTHUR (completely bewildered) I can't believe this...I've been looking...and you're here? I went to get wine and... \nTRILLIAN I know. And it was rude to just leave, but I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside, well, honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type. (hopeful) But you're here... \nArthur smiles, then realizes with some regret... \nARTHUR Actually -- I am that type. But...well you do know what happened, don't you? \nZaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur. \nZAPHOD --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride, and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember? I stole a ship? \nARTHUR We're having a bit of a chat if you don't mind. \nArthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly, Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots all the up way revealing a second head that lives somewhere under his chin. \nZAPHOD HEAD 2 You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up or I'll kick you in the gones! \nFORD There's the Zaphod I remember. \nArthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists. \nZaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw.

Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian. \nFORD Two heads. Interesting choice. \nZAPHOD Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain. \nFORD So you carved it up? \nZAPHOD Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is-- (thinking) --I don't know. Obviously.

TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail. \nTRILLIAN (CONT'D) Hey.   What are they doing in there? \nBefore she can catch them, they scurry under the door. \nTRILLIAN {CONT'D) They were from my lab at university.

What brings you to our humble planet? \nZAPHOD I think you know why I'm here. \nHUMMA KAVULA I don't think I do. \nZAPHOD Oh, I think you think you don't, but we both know -- you do. \nHUMMA KAVULA Elequent as always, Zaphod.

And I don't know what you're talking about. \nZAPHOD HEAD 2 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I was stupid. \nHUMMA KAVULA This Humma you speak of no longer exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers. \nZAPHOD HEAD 2 I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!! \nThe 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place. \nZAPHOD Thank you. \nThe 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD picks it up. \nWITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN \nARTHUR Why do I get the feeling he's going to get us all killed? \nFORD Probably because it's very possible.    Just don't save me, okay? We're even. \nHumma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to the base of his torso.

Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile. \nZAPHOD That's really not the point. \nHUMMA KAVULA You haven't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you here, Zaphod? \nZaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who grabs his arm, twists it -- hard. \nZAPHOD (wincing) I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea, I ended up here. \nPUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses. \nHUMMA KAVULA How very, very... (knowingly) ...improbable. \nHe pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest. \nHUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D) I kept a few souvenirs from my former life. Ah, the heady days of space piracy... so young, so foolish.., \nAnother, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.) \nHUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D) I'll gladly give you the coordinates to Magrathea... \nHe holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF COORDINATE NUMBERS on each side.

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more.

As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood. \nSeconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed. \n51      INT.

RIPLEY I don't know. 
GORMAN (to team) Proceed inside. 
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     83 
They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place seems almost alive. 
INT. APC                                                 84 
They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the wall detail. 
RIPLEY (low) Oh God... 
CLOSE ON VIDEO  as it PAN SLOWLY...REVEALING a bas-relief of detritus from the colony:  furniture, wiring, human bones, skulls...Fused together with a translucent, epoxylike substance. 
DIETRICH (voice over; static) Looks like some sort of secreted resin. 
GORMAN They ripped apart the colony for building materials. 
RIPLEY And the colonists...When they were done with them. (turning) Newt, you better go sit up front.  Go on. 
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     85 
Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper inside. 
FROST Hotter'n hell in here. 
HUDSON Yeah...but it's a dry heat. 
INT. APC                                                 86 
Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN. 
RIPLEY They're right under the primary heat exchangers. 
BURKE Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... 
RIPLEY That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. 
BURKE (realizing) She's right. 
GORMAN So. 
RIPLEY So...then the fusion containment shuts down. 
GORMAN (impatient) So?  So? 
BURKE We're talking thermonuclear explosion. 
GORMAN Shit. (into mike) Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there. 
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87 
The troopers look at each other in dismay. 
WIERZBOWSKI Is he fucking crazy? 
HUDSON What're we supposed to use, man?  Harsh language? 
GORMAN (voice over; static) Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung. 
APONE Let's go.  Pull 'em out. 
He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines from each one's weapon. 
Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly. 
The three who are carrying them get out small incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt stock.  Chambers a round. 
HICKS (low, to Hudson) I always keep this handy. For close encounter. 
APONE (o.s.) Let's move.  Hicks, back us up. 
INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88 
The air is thick.  Lights flare. 
GORMAN (voice over; very faint) Any movement?

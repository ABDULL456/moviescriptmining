CORALINE (loud whisper) Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you? 
A muffled screen door slams O.S. and the Tall Other Mother calls to her from the kitchen. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Breakfast-time! 
Coraline leaves frame. 
INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Coraline pauses in the doorway. 
CORALINE (V.O.) (to herself) Be strong, Coraline. 
She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her back to the sink. 
Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the oven. 
At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks: 
CORALINE (CONT'D) (anxious, trying to be cool) Why don't we play ... a game? I know you like them. 
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes FLASH. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Everybody likes games. 
CORALINE 
(NODS) Uh huh. 
Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER What kind of game would it be? 
CORALINE) An exploring game ... a finding things game. 
Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers drum with excitement. 
OTHER MOTHER And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline? 
Coraline hesitates. 
CORALINE My real parents. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER 
(DISMISSIVE) Too easy. 
She folds the omelet over in the pan. 
CORALINE And, and the eyes of the ghost children. 
Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Huh. 
The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the food to Coraline. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) What if you don't find them? 
CORALINE If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me. (indicates button box) And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game? 
CORALINE Then you let me go. You let everyone go Â­ my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here. 
The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million years smile. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Deal. 
She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach. 
CORALINE Not till you give me a clue. 
Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very stupid child. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Oh, right... In each of three wonders I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight. 
CORALINE And for my parents? 
Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON EYE with her finger nail. Coraline turns away from her. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) 
(SHRUGS) Fine. Don't tell me... 
Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) ...it's a deal-- 
But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink. 
Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the dripping faucet. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) What does she mean "wonders?"

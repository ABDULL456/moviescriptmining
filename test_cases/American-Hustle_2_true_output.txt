Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving, come to mama. Come on. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) You might say she was my karma for how I took advantage of people. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving, come here. Come on. Get into bed. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Alright. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD 63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63 
INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
DANNY SITS PLAYING ON THE BED WITH HIS TOYS. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) I did not want to leave the kid behind. He was my son. She had me. I was her mark. 
INT. LONDON ASSOCIATES - DAY 
SLOW PUSH IN FROM WIDE SHOT BEHIND NEW CLIENT/MARK, FROM THE BACK, AS THEY SIT FACING EDITH, TO ONE SIDE, AND IRV, BEHIND THE DESK. 
CAMERA KEEPS PUSHING IN SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK OF THE MARK'S HEAD AS HE FACES SYD AND IRV. 
WE NOW SEE THE MARK: A charismatic, mercurial, wild eyed BUSINESSMAN "MORT PAPIERMAN" in need of a loan. 
Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv notices uncomfortably. He's JEALOUS. 
IRVING ROSENFELD -- and every deal I take, I close. However, my fee is non refundable, just like my time. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (filling out paper work) I want to thank you very much Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so nervous. 
Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Am I not buttoned? 
Edith stares at him and smiles. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I just gotta say Mr. Rosenfeld, that Lady Edith was very adamant that you were top notch and -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's correct. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO I really need your help. I'm desperate. I've got the Audis for collateral and the two boats, and I forgot to mention that I have a little piece of real estate in Long Island. 
EDITH GREENSLY No, you didn't mention that. Two lunches and you never mentioned that. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO Oh, I was gonna mention it and then the guy with the hat walked in. 
EDITH GREENSLY The hat. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO And I forgot totally. It was the second time we had lunch. 
EDITH GREENSLY You couldn't see his eyes. He had no eyes. It was like, did he make it? 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (laughing) Do they sell hats like that? Where do they come from? Actually, I went to the store that I thought maybe he bought it there. I was gonna get you one -- 
EDITH GREENSLY You were going to get me one? 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO Like as a memento. 
Irving decides to interject. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Two lunches? 
EDITH GREENSLY Yes. It's two lunches. What's the big deal? 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's unusual. 
EDITH GREENSLY I was trying to get him to be more aggressive. On his loan that is. 
Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO You showed me a whole new side of the city I'd never seen before. 
EDITH GREENSLY Oh, good. You're welcome. 
Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO No, thank you. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I take you there? 
EDITH GREENSLY Yes. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Should I take you there twice? 
EDITH GREENSLY Stop. 
IRVING MOTIONS SYDNEY TO COME CLOSE HE WHISPERS CONFIDENTIALLY TO HER. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (confidential to Edith) What's going on, you like this guy? 
EDITH GREENSLY Yes I like this guy. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Is that messing up your judgement? Don't be stupid. 
SYDNEY PROSSER No, he's not messing with my judgment. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Hey, play your part. 
EDITH GREENSLY Fine. You play your part. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (holds out cashiers check) Take it to your people in London. Please, take it to them. I got the cashier's check right here. I give you five and you give me fifty right back, right? Please. Please don't reject me. Give a guy a chance.

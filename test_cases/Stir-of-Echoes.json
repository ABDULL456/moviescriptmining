{"test1_input": "PHILIP Tom, look -- \nTOM Nobody? Well, then I guess the party's over, ain't it? (to Maggie) Let's go. Come on, let's go home. \nPHILIP You're getting a little too worked up about this. \nTOM You know, I don't think so, because I'll tell you something, it's a very nasty feeling to know somebody's been fuckin' around in your head for everybody else's amusement, you know? (lightening up a bit) I mean, Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven't thought about him in maybe ten years, and -- come on, man, somebody else has gotta go. Don't make me be the only- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) On the mantle over the fireplace, a clock CHIMES. Everyone is immediately silent, staring at Tom. He looks at the clock. It's eleven. He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe -- -- and throws it out the window. There is an explosion of laughter. \nPHILIP Why'd you do that, Tom? \nTOM I... have no idea. Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back. Tom nods, \"yeah, yeah, laugh it up.\" \nPHILIP I couldn't resist. Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down, choking him. But it's playful, his sense of humor returning. \nTOM Any other surprises you left in my head, you fuckin' dead man, you? \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT It's dark. Tom and Maggie lie in bed, awake. \nMAGGIE I hope it's a girl, I can't help it. Six brothers, I mean, give me a break. I'm sick of all these balls around the house. He doesn't laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one hand. MAGGIE (cont' d) What's the matter? \nTOM Two kids. I'm only twenty-six. How did this happen? She slides one hand down, under the covers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE (imitating him) \"Please, baby, please baby, just this one time, I can't feel anything with one of those on.\" \nTOM No, I now how it happened, I'm just sayin'... You're gonna have to stop work, at least for a while. I'll be workin' Saturdays for at least another year, maybe two. \nMAGGIE You don't have to. We'll get by, we always do. Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling. \nTOM How many times I gotta ask Harry to fix that? He said he fixed this place up, so how come the roof leaks every time it rains? \nMAGGIE Relax. Her hand is moving. He twists. \nTOM Maggie, you don't think, I mean, ten, twelve years from now... I don't want you to think I'm gonna be a line man forever, you know, like Frank or somethin'. \nMAGGIE It's a good job. You know how many guys would kill for your job? \nTOM I'm smarter than that, I know I am. \nMAGGIE (kisses his ear) Relax. She's making it hard for him to concentrate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTOM I'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six years in college, he's still got his head up his ass. I just want you to know, this ain't where I plan to stop. She licks his ear. He closes his eyes. TOM (cont' d) All my life, I feel like there's something better inside me, it's trying like hell to get out and it's like x won't let it. She rolls on top of him and whispers. \n", "test1_true": "LATER, the clock reads 2:31 a.m. Maggie is asleep, Tom is lying on his back, still awake. He looks over at the clock, agitated. He stares up at the ceiling. He closes his eyes. \nA BARRAGE OF IMAGES races across the back of his eyelids: -- Philip's face, close to his, a finger held in front of him. -- A flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter. Six more faces, pressed in close to his. Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie theatre. \nIN THE BEDROOM, Tom snaps his eyes open. He rolls over onto his side, punching his pillow. He closes his eyes again. \nMORE IMAGES COME, faster this time. We share his point of view: -- A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a dumpster. -- A fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick building. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: -- A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf. -- Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us. The images Increase in speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast they're almcst subliminal -- a car tire, a broken arm, falling into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a bolt of lightning. \nIN THE BEDROOM, Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his head to clear it. \nTOM .the fuck, man? He puts his hands to the side of his head. It hurts. A lot. Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up. Tom gets up and walks out. As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take. \nIN JAKE'S ROOM, the four year old is awake. Not just awake, but standing next to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway. Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the nightlight. \nTOM \n(WHISPERS) Jake? The little boy doesn't answer. Tom walks slowly over to the boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the boy's shoulders. TOM (cont' d) Are you okay? Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes. The boy's face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out with one hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead. \nJAKE Don't be afraid of it, Daddy. The hell does that mean? But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed, rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep. \nINT BATHROOM NIGHT Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a glass of water. He runs water in the sink, splashes some on his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then summons his nerve and closes his eyes. \nIMMEDIATELY, more images come. -- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands on the porch, waving to us to come in. -- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face. -- A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses. -- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them. We hit, hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood. \nIN THE BATHROOM, Tom's eyes pop open. That was disturbing. \nINT LIVING ROOM NIGHT Tom strides into the living room. Their house is small, crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen. \nIN THE KITCHEN, Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf. He finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice. He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it. He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still unsatisfied, he picks up the carton. He drinks the rest. Juice runs down his chin. \nBACK IN THE LIVING ROOM, Tom drops onto the sofa. He sits for a moment, trying to regain himself. His breathing returns to normal. He sits forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back -- -- there's a woman sitting next to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's almost luminous. She's attractive but odd, she wears a billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and down each wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red- rimmed. Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor. \nWOMA I You can kiss me if you want to. Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch. The woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her words are lost under the rising sound of static on the television. \nTOM What?! She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back -- -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room, looking all around him. But he's alone. \nINT BEDROOM NIGHT Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight around him. He's shivering. \nA HAND drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin. It's Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep. He takes her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open. \nCUT TO: \nINT KITCHEN DAY Morning. Tom and Maggie sit at the kitchen table. From the living room, we can hear a-kids' morning show on the television. Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform shirt. Maggie is staring at him. They keep their voices low. \nMAGGIE What do you mean, like... You mean like a hallucination? \nTOM Maybe. I was awake, I know that. She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this. \n", "test1_id": 909, "test2_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE Did you, uh, get her name? \nTOM You know, she didn't menti. -in it. \nMAGGIE You sure you weren't dreami.g? \nTOM Positive. I had this headache like you wouldn't believe, and I was thirsty as hell. \nMAGGIE What should we do? You want to call Philip? \nTOM Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't think he's got a fuckin' clue in life. From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on the TV. \nMAGGIE How about my cousin Elizabeth? \nTOM I don't need brain surgery, I just had a weird thing happen, that's all. Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time deal, don't worry about it. \nMAGGIE Well, if anything like this happens again, we should go talk to Elizabeth. \nTOM Maggie... \nMAGGIE Promise me. \nTOM I promise. \nCUT TO: \nEXT HOUSE DAY There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide with the red lights. Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house. He hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at the front of his own house. \nHE REMEMBERS one of the images that blasted through his mind last night. It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way -- \"C'mon in.\" But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat. \nBACK IN THE PICKUP, Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as \nTHE FOOTBALL BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal \nCLANG. Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY, seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed. \nTOM Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me! The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches for the football. Tom beats him to it. TOM (cont' d) You gotta play right here in the middle of the street? Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over his shoulder. \nFRANK Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your own grandfather . \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM (looking at his hood) Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even my truck. They're gonna dock me for this. \nFRANK That'll pop right out. Use one of them plunger things. Adam, say you're sorry. \nADAM I'm really sorry, Mr. Witzky. \nFRANK There you go, he said he's sorry, whaddya want from a kid. Let's go. Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a great-looking seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's hand. Tom looks at him. \n", "test2_true": "IN THE TRUCK, Tom gets back in and closes the door. \nFRANK That Damon kid, he's gonna break your old passing records this Friday. \nTOM Bound to happen some time. \nFRANK Comin' to the game? \nTOM (starts the car) Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin' HARRY (o.s.) Hey, Tom! Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is staring out the window, looking right at Tom. Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now. HARRY (cont' d) Thought I'd stop by and pick up the rent. Save you the trip across the street. \nTOM It's still two days yet, isn't it? Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house. \nHARRY Yeah, just thought you'd want to get it out of your hair. \nTOM \n(DISTRACTED) Well, my checkbook's inside. \nHARRY I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we picked to miss last night, huh? How many yards Adam end up with? Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision. \nFRANK Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns. Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling away. \nCUT TO: \nINT SIGNAL DIVISION DAY The signal division of the local phone company has a large main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows a forest of jagged, blinking lines. \nIN THE TOWERS, Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards. He pulls a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he cuts in on a \nWOMAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) (on phone line) -which was okay, I guess, but then he told me he loves me, and it was just like, oh my God, can you please make yourself any less attractive? Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line. Now it's a \nSNEAKY MAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) -unless they find out we already locked in with Cooper at eighty, so it's imperative we lead them to believe we're honestly trying to-, Tom clips to another line. It's a SEXY WOMAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) -start at my lips and lick your way all the way down to my- Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human. The voice abruptly changes. VOICE (coast' d) Hey, did somebody pick up on your end? Is your wife there? Tom unclips and picks another line. He gets a dial tone. He enters a number on his headset. A SLEEPY VOICE answers. \nTOM Phil, it's Tom. Is there anything else important you said to me last night, while I was under? \nINT PHILIP'S APARTMENT DAY Philip (Maggie'a brother) is still in bed in his apartment. It's a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a lovely view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the air. Philip's hung over. He holds the phone like he resents it. \nPHILIP What time is it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TOM (o.a.) Quarter after eight. What are you, still in bed? \nPHILIP Quarter after eight? Jesus, Tom, this is barbaric. \n(INTERCUT) \nTOM Other than the shoe thing, what else did you say to me? \n", "test2_id": 910, "test3_input": "HARRY Tom's askin' about that Muller girl from over by Baldwin, you know, the one that ran away? \nLENNY The retard. \nFRANK Jesus, Lenny, don't use that word. \nLENNY What, retard? \nFRANK \n(SARCASTIC) No, \"the.\" \nTOM She was almost your age, Adam. You know anything about her? Adam doesn't answer right away. They all look at him. \nFINALLY: \nADAM Huh uh. Suddenly, the guys playing football run a play right through the middle of them -- sweaty, middle-aged bodies fly in every direction. Everybody SHOUTS and lunges backward, protecting their beers. The conversation is broken up. But the football players are upset, and a fight breaks out. The crowd gets out of the way, half to watch the fight with glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight. \nOVER AT KURT'S CAR, while the fight goes on in the background, Adam wanders away from the group and sits down on the hood of Kurt Damon's car. He's rattled. Kurt notices him and comes over. He sits next to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKURT You okay? \nADAM Yeah. (Kurt is looking atIhim: I'm fine. \nKURT You don't look fine. \nADAM Really, Mom? How do I look? \nKURT (hands up in surrender) All right, all right. Just, if there's, you know, if there's somethin' you wanna bullshit about or anything, just let me know. Might help. \nADAM You could climb off my back, that'd help. Adam walks away. \nKURT Sorry. \nAT THE END OF THE BLOCK, two police cars arrive, their lights flashing. COPS jump out and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight. So much for the party. Sheila shakes her head. \nSHEILA It can't ever just be nice. Someone's always got to ruin it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT ROOFTOP NIGHT Nighttime. The city lights are on. The sound of SOBBING rises faintly over them. We're on the roof of a house, and a figure with its back to us is doing the crying. The figure drinks from a bottle. A long, hard pull. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Coming around thefrontwe see the figure is Adam McCarthy, Frank and Sheila'sson,sitting on the roof of his house, staring out at thecityand getting quietly shit-faced. \nCUT TO: \nINT BE. ROOM DAY Tom pries his eyes open, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's 10:26. \nTOM Oh, man... He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes. \n", "test3_true": "INT BATHROOM DAY A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- \"WENT TO THE PARK \nWITH JAKE. M.\" Tom takes it down and reads it. \nINT LIVING ROOM DAY Tom comes downstairs and heads for the kitchen. There's someone standing in his living room, in the doorway from the dining room. It's Frank, his neighbor from next door, wearing a red shirt. Frank is staring at the floor. \nTOM Frank? What are you doing here? Frank looks up at him. His face is sad. \nFRANK They're going to kill you, Tommy. You and Maggie both. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks outside, and sits on the top step of the porch, looking out at the street. Tom follows him. \nEXT FRONT PORCH DAY It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a m..ss from the party yesterday. Tom comes out and looks down at Frank, who's just sitting there, staring out at the litter. \nTOM Why did you say that, Frank? \nFRANK (in his own world) This is a decent neighborhood. On the street, TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each other, full tilt, SCREAMING. At the last second, one of the kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of \"Chicken!\" A bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches. He walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house. The MAILMAN waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back. Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks. A VOICE calls from inside. ADAM (o.s.) Come in! \nINT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY Tom opens the door and comes in. Adam, Frank's son, is standing in the middle of the living room floor, a big smile on his face and one arm behind his back. \nADAM Hi! \nTOM Hi. \nADAM Want to see what I've got? \nTOM Sure. Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back. He's holding a 38 with a carved white handle. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TOM (cont' d) Is that your dad's? \nADAM Not today. Come here: Tom walks toward him. ADAM (cont' d) Closer. Tom walks closer. He's right in front of Adam. ADAM (cont' d) I bet you never saw this before. He points the gun barrel at Tom -- -- then swings it around and points it at his own heart. \nTOM Oh, don't do that. Adam pulls the trigger. Tom SCREAMS as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from his chest. His body convulses -- \nINT BEDROOM DAY -- and Tom's eyes pop open, in bed. That was weird. Tom blinks, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's \nTOM Oh, man... He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes. \nA MINUTE LATER, Tom pulls on a pair of jeans. He sits down, puts on a shoe. But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not there. He opens the closet door. Not there. Tom blinks, unsettled. This is kinda familiar. He turns and looks at the bed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM Please don't be under there. He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed. There's his shoe. TOM (cont' d) Shit. He grabs it. \nINT BATHROOM DAY A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- \"WENT TO THE PARK \nWITH JAKE. M.\" Tom winces as he takes it down and reads it. Again. \nINT LIVING ROOM DAY Shod, Tom comes down the stairs and into the living room. Frank's not there, thank God. Tom goes to the front door and opens it. \n", "test3_id": 911}

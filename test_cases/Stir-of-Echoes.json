{"train": "STIR OF ECHOES \nWritten by \nDavid Koepp \nBased on the novel \nRichard Matheson \nMarch 26, 1998 \nSometimes within the brain's old ghostly house, I hear, far off, at some forgotten door, A music and an eerie faint carouse And stir of echoes down the creaking floor. \"Chambers of Imagery\" Archibald MacLeish \nIn the black, a child HUMS. Gentle WATER sounds. \nFADE IN: \nINT A BATHROOM NIGHT JAKE, a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub. The door to thi bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background, walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes off the tile in the tiny bathroom. Jake is playing with a plastic airplane. He answers a question. \nJAKE \nYES \n(PAUSE) Sometimes. \n(PAUSE) With my toys. He looks up, but we're close in on him and can't see who he's looking at. JAKE (cont'd) My... blue sword. No! The one with the gray tape around the middle. That one. He lands the airplane on the water. He giggles. JAKE (coast' d) That's silly. MAGGIE (o.s.) (from the bedroom) Jake? You all right in there? \nJAKE (calling out to the door) \nYES! The airplane takes off again. Jake lowers his voice to a whisper. JAKE (cont'd) What? \n(PAUSE) My daddy, but he doesn't know about it yet. He brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets go of it. He looks up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JAKE (cont' d) Can I ask you a question? He pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn't too close. Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the bathroom, staring at the empty bathtub across from him. JAKE (cont'd) Does it hurt to be dead? \nUNDER THE WATER, the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the tub. \nIN THE BATHROOM, MAGGIE WITZKY, twenty-six or seven, Jake's mom, city girl knows how to take care of herself, pokes her head in the doorway, buttoning up her blouse. \nMAGGIE Who you talkin' to, Jake? He turns to her and whispers. \nJAKE It's a secret. \nCUT TO: \nINT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT TOM WITZKY, Maggie's age, lean and muscled like somebody who works for a living, lies on Jake's bed next to his son, reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep. \nTOM Well, I was walking in the night, and I saw nothing scary. For I have never been afraid of anything. Not very. I was deep within the woods when, suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I stopped. What could those pants be there for? What could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for? Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers. \nMAGGIE Is he asleep? My brother's here. \n(CONTINUED) \nHARRY What are you, runnin' for Mayor? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) LENNY, the local crank, pipes up. \nLENNY Hey, did any of you guys see those Dominican crack dealers hangin' around the park again? Everybody GROANS. \nFRANK (to Bobby) What is Lenny doing here? Did you tell him you were having a party?! \nBOBBY Vanessa made me. \nLENNY Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and when you all wake up dead with your throats cut some night -- \nFRANK I mean, I could see if he just heard the noise and wandered in, but to actually invite him into your home.. . \nLENNY -- don't come cryin' to me! \nACROSS THE ROOM, Philip surveys the selection of females. He sees VANESSA, late twenties, hasn't lost the weight from the last baby yet -- \nPHILIP Not attracted to... -- SHEILA, a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age -- PHILIP (cont' d) Not drunk enough for... -- and a LOUD WOMAN with enormous hair. PHILIP (cont' d) Frightened by... \nLATER, everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones that remain are bombed. A DRUNK COUPLE dances dirty. Frank stares long and hard at someone's cleavage. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at Frank, pissed off. He looks at her, gives her a \"What?\" gesture. Must be married to each other. Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a SHRIEK of women's voice: and turns. He sees Maggie blushing, receiving hugs and congrLtulations from the two or three women around her. \nIN THE :ITCHEN, Vanessa talks to Maggie while she mixes up a blender of Margaritas. The room is jammed with people. \nVANESSA How did you and Tom meet? \nMAGGIE He saved my life. \nVANESSA No, really. \nMAGGIE I'm serious. The summer I was nineteen, I was at Jones Beach, I swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg. There was no way I was gonna make it back. I was goin' down, I was swallowing water and everything. Tom was a lifeguard. I don't know what he was doing out that far, he said he just had a feeling. \nVANESSA Oh my God, did you have sex with him like, that night? \nMAGGIE Had to. He said I'm his slave until I saved him back. \nVANESSA That's so romantic. Bobby and I met when I peed in the guys' john at a Bon Jovi concert. She hits \"puree\" on the blender. \nSTILL LATER, the party's down to the hard-core half dozen, who are passing a joint. Tom sits on the couch, feet on the coffee table next to their baby monitor. Maggie is next to him, Frank and Sheila are jammed in there too. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor opposite. Philip is in a chair at the end. \nVANESSA P(ople who say they were hypnotized weren't really, they were just, you kn)w, playing along. \nPHILIP Then how could they have needles stuck into their throats without bleeding? Without even making a sound? \nFRANK Bullshit. \nPHILIP \n(AUTHORITATIVE) Be quiet. (they do) Look at it. Keep looking at it. Don't look at anything else, just my finger. \nTOM Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda makin' me sick here. Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes. TOM (cont' d) Hey, what the fuck? \nPHILIP Shall we try this again? \nTOM (rubbing his eyes) Asshole. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPHILIP Look at me, Tom. You're not afraid of this. You want this to happen. Don't you? \nTOM Poke me again you son of a batch and I'll clock you, I swear to Go'.. \nMAGGIE Philip, have you ever done this before? \nPHILIP Maggie, please, I nearly have a master's degree in cognitive psy- \nMAGGIE Have you ever done it before? \nPHILIP Well, I've seen it done a dozen times. \nMAGGIE Try not to screw him up permanently. \nPHILIP (to Tom) You want to be hypnotized. Say yes. \nTOM Yeah. \nPHILIP \"I want to be hypnotized.\" \nTOM I want to be fuckin' hypnotized, already. \nPHILIP Okay. Close your eyes. As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us into blackness. PHILIP (o.s.) Just listen for a moment. \nIN THE BLACK, we can still hear the sounds of the living room. Tom breathes. Ice CLINKS in a glass as someone drinks. A car HUMS by outside. PHILIP (o.s.) Now look at the backs of your eyelids. Do you see anything there? TOM (o.s.) Uh... Out of the pitch black, we can detect tiny images. TOM (o.s.) Some colors... something floating... up. PHILIP (o . s . ) Focus on it. A small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through the black, then bouncing suddenly downward. PHILIP (o.s.) Now... I want you to pretend you're in a theatre. \nINT THEATRE NIGHT We're sitting in a theatre, a bare stage at the front. PHILIP (o . s . ) A movie theatre. \nINT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT Okay, we're sitting in a movie theatre. It's crowded with people, waiting for the movie to start. PHILIP (o.s.) You're the only one there. The people disappear. The theatre is empty. PHILIP (o . s . ) You're sitting near the front. We pop up ten rows closer to the screen. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PHILIP (o . s . ) The walls of the theatre are black, covered with black velvet. SHOOOP! Black velvet descends over the walls. PHILIP (o . s . ) The seats are covered with black velvet. Black velvet crawls over the seats. PHILIP (o . s . ) There is no light in the theatre. The lights click off. PHILIP (o . s . ) In the whole pitch-black theatre, there's only one thing you can see. The white screen. You drift toward it, in your chair. Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move slowly toward it, floating over the seats. PHILIP (o . s . ) There are letters up on the screen. Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus. You drift closer to them, trying to read them. Blurry black letters appear on the screen. We drift closer. PHILIP (o. s . ) You're comfortable in your black velvet seat, very comfortable. You just sit there, looking at the screen, drifting closer in your chair, staring at those letters on the screen. You're relaxing. Your feet and ankles are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed. Your hands are limp and heavy. Your arms are relaxed. Your face. The letters come into focus, you're close enough now, you can read them. The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry. PHILIP (o . s . ) The letters spell -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) The moment he speaks the word, five giant black letters come into focus on the white screen, filling our entire field of vision. PHILIP (o . s . ) \nSLEEP. We stare at that word for a moment -- -- and then everything goes black. No sound, no image, no nothing. And then... \nINT BOBBY & VANESSA'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT Six faces stare right at us from up close. Tom is in the chair, eyes open, looking disoriented. \nPHILIP Tom, look -- \nTOM Nobody? Well, then I guess the party's over, ain't it? (to Maggie) Let's go. Come on, let's go home. \nPHILIP You're getting a little too worked up about this. \nTOM You know, I don't think so, because I'll tell you something, it's a very nasty feeling to know somebody's been fuckin' around in your head for everybody else's amusement, you know? (lightening up a bit) I mean, Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven't thought about him in maybe ten years, and -- come on, man, somebody else has gotta go. Don't make me be the only- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) On the mantle over the fireplace, a clock CHIMES. Everyone is immediately silent, staring at Tom. He looks at the clock. It's eleven. He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe -- -- and throws it out the window. There is an explosion of laughter. \nPHILIP Why'd you do that, Tom? \nTOM I... have no idea. Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back. Tom nods, \"yeah, yeah, laugh it up.\" \nPHILIP I couldn't resist. Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down, choking him. But it's playful, his sense of humor returning. \nTOM Any other surprises you left in my head, you fuckin' dead man, you? \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT It's dark. Tom and Maggie lie in bed, awake. \nMAGGIE I hope it's a girl, I can't help it. Six brothers, I mean, give me a break. I'm sick of all these balls around the house. He doesn't laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one hand. MAGGIE (cont' d) What's the matter? \nTOM Two kids. I'm only twenty-six. How did this happen? She slides one hand down, under the covers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE (imitating him) \"Please, baby, please baby, just this one time, I can't feel anything with one of those on.\" \nTOM No, I now how it happened, I'm just sayin'... You're gonna have to stop work, at least for a while. I'll be workin' Saturdays for at least another year, maybe two. \nMAGGIE You don't have to. We'll get by, we always do. Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling. \nTOM How many times I gotta ask Harry to fix that? He said he fixed this place up, so how come the roof leaks every time it rains? \nMAGGIE Relax. Her hand is moving. He twists. \nTOM Maggie, you don't think, I mean, ten, twelve years from now... I don't want you to think I'm gonna be a line man forever, you know, like Frank or somethin'. \nMAGGIE It's a good job. You know how many guys would kill for your job? \nTOM I'm smarter than that, I know I am. \nMAGGIE (kisses his ear) Relax. She's making it hard for him to concentrate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTOM I'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six years in college, he's still got his head up his ass. I just want you to know, this ain't where I plan to stop. She licks his ear. He closes his eyes. TOM (cont' d) All my life, I feel like there's something better inside me, it's trying like hell to get out and it's like x won't let it. She rolls on top of him and whispers. \nPHILIP Hang on, lemme, I gotta get my bearings here... Who is this again? \nTOM Phil, I gotta get back to work, was there anything else you told me to do after I came out of it? \nPHILIP If you're asking if I gave you a post- \nHYP- \nTOM Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what it's called, Phil. Did you leave any others behind when you were kickin' your big, clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain? \nPHILIP No. \nTOM Tell me the truth, Phil! \nPHILIP No, I swear! I went out of my way not to, I even added a thing at the end to make sure! \nTOM What thing? \nPHILIP I, I didn't want you to retain any of the experience, you know, I wanted you to have control back, so I made up this thing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTOM What thing? \nPHILIP God, I don't remember, I haven't had caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how am I supposed to- \nTOM In general, what was it? \nPHILIP Well, it was perfectly harmless, I just said, uh, I said \"When you come out from under, your mind will be completely free. There's nothing binding it. Nothing holding it back. You will be completely open.\" Tom stops, thinking for a long moment. \nTOM Yeah, I'd say that about describes it. \nPHILIP Describes what? \nTOM Never mind, it's gone now. I gotta go. \nPHILIP Describes what? But Tom has hung up. Philip unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep. \nCUT TO: \nINT KITCHEN DAY Jake sits at the kitchen table in his pajamas, eating a bowl of cereal. Maggie, in work clothes, is walking back and forth behind him, talking on the phone, finishing her makeup, drinking coffee, and doing the dishes. MAGGIE (o . s . ) Hi, Adriana, it's Maggie. Listen, our baby-sitter just backed out on us for next Friday night -- Jake turns and looks at the empty chair next to him. He smiles at it. Then he giggles. He covers his mouth. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MAGGIE (cont' d) -- and there's this game Tom and I really wanted to go to and I was wondering if... \nJAKE (to the chair) I told him. MAGGIE (o.s.) (into phone) Oh. Yeah, I understand. No, no, no, don't worry about it. Okay. Bye. (hangs up) Shit. Shoot. Shoot, I mean. She picks up the phone and dials again. With all she's doing, she doesn't notice that Jake is having a conversation with the empty chair. MAGGIE (cont' d) (into phone) Philip, hi, it's me, call me when you wake up, is there any way -- \nJAKE Yes. \nMAGGIE -- you'd consider dumping whatever bimbo you're going out with Friday night and baby-sitting for us instead? \nJAKE Who? \nFRANK (to Tom) Don't get me wrong, it's great what the Damon kid is doin' and everything, I mean, I'm sorry your record's gettin' broke, but, what, it held up almost ten years? Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder, still plagued with a headache. \nTOM Yeah, `bout that. They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for kickoff. \nFRANK (raising his voice over the \nCROWD) So you got that, that's great. What I'm sayin', though, is this year it's all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon that, and yeah, the kid has an arm, but high school football is running the ball -- smash-mouth, in-your-face, power football. Always been that way. Tom glances up at a mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass under it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The same BUZZING sound, the one he heard when he first looked at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from the street light. Tom shakes it off. FRANK (cost' d) Now Adam, and I admit, L am biased, but my kid is having ona hell of a season and it's like nol.-)dy noticed. If they'd just give him he carries he could break a thousand yards. And on an eight game schedule! He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past. Frank notices. Carefully. \nBEHIND THEM, Sheila and Maggie walk together. Sheila stares at Frank as he ogles the teenager. \nSHEILA Look at him. Why doesn't he just lick them when they walk by? \nMAGGIE \n(LAUGHS) According to Tom, the average guy carries around a hard-on two and a half hours out of every day. What are you gonna do? \nSHEILA \n(DARKLY) I've got a few ideas. A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walks past and Frank gives her the big crank-around. SHEILA (cont' d) Look at that! He's not even picky. I swear to God, that man will stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm.. Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple. She catches up. \nMAGGIE Are you okay? He forces a smile. They head into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium. \nIN THE TUNNEL, Frank raises his voice still higher. It becomes a horrible drone to Tom. \nFRANK Six eighty-three with three game.- left, he only needs to average, ti.iat, a hundred and five, hundred and six yards a game? He hits a thousand and we're talkin' major scholarships, the kid could write his own ticket. That kinda thing's good for everybody, helps the whole neighborhood. He's goin' a hell of a lot farther than I ever did. Look at the quality of the tail he's already gettin'. He passed me in that department when he was about fourteen. He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig. \nEXT FOOTBALL FIELD NIGHT They come through the tunnel and into the stands. Below, the field is brightly lit. Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned out by the enthusiasm of the crowd. They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers and sit down. The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and beers snuck in here and there. And that's the grown-ups. \nON THE FIELD, the visitors kick off. \nIN THE STANDS, the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but he's totally distracted. He looks to the right, drawn by a flash of light. A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field with its high beams on. Tom stares at the lights. The BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares. The crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back, tries to follow the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead. Maggie is staring at him. She takes his hand and leans over, SHOUTING into his ear. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE \nWHAT'S WRONG? As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn by something just over her head. A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them. When Tom s\\ares directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his ears -- -- and he leaps to his feet. \nTOM Sf\"S TAXING BIM AWWAY! \nMAGGIE \nWHAT?! Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people. They SHOUT their objections. \nINT TUNNEL NIGHT Tom races down the now-empty tunnel. A light shines at the far end, BUZZING madly. A few seconds later, Maggie starts into the tunnel. \nMAGGIE Tom, wait! \nEXT BUSY STREET NIGHT Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can. Maggie follows a few moments later. \nTOM Do you want me to call the police? (shakes her head no) Then tell me why you took him. \nDOROTHY He isn't safe in your house. \nTOM Why do you say that? \nDOROTHY He told me! He told me so! The DRIVER of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus now. He SHOUTS at them from the other side of the lot. \nTOM Jake said that? (she nods) What else did he say? \nDOROTHY Nothing. I was sitting there, I was watching him sleep, I was just watching him, like I'm supposed to, and... and he sat up in bed, he looked right at me, and he said \"I'm not safe in this house.\" Two times, he said it, and then he went back to sleep. \nTOM Where were you taking him? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDOROTHY California. To my father's house. My real father, not -- (like poison on her tongue) -- Duane. Jake would be safe at my father's house, we'd both be safe there. \nTOM You too? (she nods) Why aren't you safe here? She doesn't answer. The Driver is coming over to them, still \nSHOUTING. TOM (cont' d) Dorothy? Dorothy, why aren't you safe here? The Driver is still closer. Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to run again. Tom grabs her. TOM (coat' d) Hey, wait a sec- As his hands close around her arms -- \nAN IMAGE flashes through his mind. A MAN'S FACE, sweaty and unshaven, leers over us, too close. \nIN THE PARKING LOT, Tom abruptly pulls back from Dorothy. He is enraged. \nTOM Who is he?! She just looks at him, frightened. He shakes her, violently. TOM (cont' d) \nWHO IS HE?! \nCUT TO: \nINT DOROTHY'S HOUSE NIGHT DUANE, fortyish, slouches on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly with a rake. Duane's drinking bourbon. In his defense, he is using a glass. Duane's face is the one Tom just saw in the image in his mind. \n(CONTINUED) d16 - - \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd --- .. - - A86i - \nCONTINUED: Duane hears the front door open and close. \nDUANE You're early. Your mom's still at work. Hey, do you know if she bought any more who the fuck are you? Tom is storming across the room toward him. DUANE (cant' d) Hey hey hey hey HEY! Tom already has Duane by the collar. He wrenches him to his feet. DUANE (cont' d) \nWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE \nDOIN'?! \nTOM Are you Duane? \nDUANE Who?! I don't even know who you're- Duane looks over Tom's shoulder. Dorothy is standing in the doorway, frightened. DUANE (cont' d) Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy?! Tom hurls Duane across the coffee table, knocking over Duane's bong. Duane hits the floor hard. He starts fumbling in his pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping him to his feet again. \nTOM She's a little girl, you son of a bitch! She' s fifteen years old, and you fucked her!? What the hell is the matter with you?! YOU DON'T DO SHIT \nLIKE THAT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DEFEND \nTHEMSELVES! \nTOM Where did she go? \nDOROTHY I don't know! She don't write or nothin'. Tom looks down at the photograph again. \nTOM What's your sister's name, Dorothy? \nDOROTHY Samantha. \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM i MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT The red light glows on the baby monitor, and Jake's breathing can be heard from in his bedroom. Tom and Maggie sit on the couch in their living room, the nonitor beside them, just one light on. He has his arms arounc' her, holding her tight. His hand is bandaged. They're shaker.. \nMAGGIE Samantha? \nTOM That's what she said. \nMAGGIE Where have I heard that name before? \nTOM Dorothy said she ran away about six months ago. \nMAGGIE But she could still be around! Hiding or something. I mean, she could have actually been here when you saw her! \nTOM If she was, she's very quick getting in and out of a room. \nMAGGIE Where was she? When you saw her, where was she exactly? \nTOM On the cushion right next to you. Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out. She pulls in closer to him. \nMAGGIE What was it like? At the game, I mean, how did you know about Jake? Did you see anything? \nTOM It's hard to explain. I just got this -- feeling. \nMAGGIE Like when I was drowning? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM A little bit. But a hundred times stronger. \nMAGGIE Does it hurt when it happens? \nTOM Like you wouldn't believe. Fecls like my brain is tearing in half. \nMAGGIE God, Tommy, what's the matter with you? \nTOM Why do you assume it's bad? Maybe this is a good thing. \nMAGGIE If your brain is tearing in half? \nTOM I told you there was somethin' in me. Maybe it's comin' out. \nMAGGIE I like it better in. \nTOM Just roll with it. What's the worst that can happen? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBEHIND THEM, the Cop is still watching them. He walks closer, stops only about ten feet away, staring. Tom glances up, sees him, thinks nothing of it. The 'op steps closer. \nIN THE. WINDOW, Tom sees the reflection of the Cop. Closer now, staring. Tom turns and smiles, tight-lipped. He recognizes him from the other day. The Cop smiles back, doesn't go away. \nTOM (to Jake) Hey, look at that one! He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display. The Cop wanders closer. Tom finally turns to him, tense. TOM (cont' d) How ya doin'? \nCOP Fine, fine. He's staring at Jake. \nTOM Is there a law against lookin' in the window now? \nCOP Huh? Oh, no, `course not. I'm off duty. I live right up there. \nTOM That's great. See ya later. He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away. \nCOP It's even stronger in him than it is in you. Tom stops. Turns back. \nTOM What? The Cop smiles and makes a face -- \"you heard me.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TOM (cont' d) I don't know what you're talking about. \nCOP Jon't be afraid of it. Tom just star .s at the Cop, trembling slightly. The Cop walks forward. Fascinated, Tom does not back away. The Cop lowers his voice. COP (cont' d) You're not alone. Tom is too rattled to speak. COP (cont' d) You don't know about Cacophony yet? Tom shakes his head no. The Cop pulls out a note pad, scribbles something on a page, tears it out and holds it out to Tom. COP (cont' d) Come next time. His hand shaking, Tom accepts the paper. The Cop reaches out and tousles Jake's hair. COP (coast' d) Bye, Jake. The Cop turns and walks away. \nJAKE Bye, Neil! The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at his son as if he's never seen him before. \nCUT TO: \nINT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT Jake, fresh from a bath and in his pajamas, sits on the floor of his room, playing with model cars, intent. He's HUMMING a soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed during his bath in the opening. Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at him. They're freaked out. What have they got on their hands here? Their tone is soft, gently probing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE Jake, do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen? Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and HUMMING. MAGGIE (cont' d) I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter, remember? (Jake plays) And you said \"Samantha\" told you about Dorothy. Do you remember that? He keeps playing, HUMMING. \nTOM Jake? Mommy's asking you a question. Nothing. \nMAGGIE Is Samantha someone who talks to you sometimes, Jake? No answer. She tries a different route. MAGGIE (cont'd) Can you remember any of the things that Saman- Jake looks up sharply. \nJAKE Don't ask the boy any more questions. They freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he just refer to himself in the third person? JAKE (cant' d) Talk to me. He goes back to playing, and to that little tune. It's becoming rather haunting. Maggie and Tom look at each other. Good God. \nCUT TO: \nINT BEDROOM NIGHT Nighttime. Tom and Maggie are asleep in bed. Suddenly, Tom's eyes pop open. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM She's downstairs. He sits up. His head is killing him again. There's a glass of water on the night table. le grabs it and drinks greedily. He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He swallows. He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound asleep. He walks to the door. Maggie stirs, feeling him gone. \nHARRY Tom's askin' about that Muller girl from over by Baldwin, you know, the one that ran away? \nLENNY The retard. \nFRANK Jesus, Lenny, don't use that word. \nLENNY What, retard? \nFRANK \n(SARCASTIC) No, \"the.\" \nTOM She was almost your age, Adam. You know anything about her? Adam doesn't answer right away. They all look at him. \nFINALLY: \nADAM Huh uh. Suddenly, the guys playing football run a play right through the middle of them -- sweaty, middle-aged bodies fly in every direction. Everybody SHOUTS and lunges backward, protecting their beers. The conversation is broken up. But the football players are upset, and a fight breaks out. The crowd gets out of the way, half to watch the fight with glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight. \nOVER AT KURT'S CAR, while the fight goes on in the background, Adam wanders away from the group and sits down on the hood of Kurt Damon's car. He's rattled. Kurt notices him and comes over. He sits next to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKURT You okay? \nADAM Yeah. (Kurt is looking atIhim: I'm fine. \nKURT You don't look fine. \nADAM Really, Mom? How do I look? \nKURT (hands up in surrender) All right, all right. Just, if there's, you know, if there's somethin' you wanna bullshit about or anything, just let me know. Might help. \nADAM You could climb off my back, that'd help. Adam walks away. \nKURT Sorry. \nAT THE END OF THE BLOCK, two police cars arrive, their lights flashing. COPS jump out and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight. So much for the party. Sheila shakes her head. \nSHEILA It can't ever just be nice. Someone's always got to ruin it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT ROOFTOP NIGHT Nighttime. The city lights are on. The sound of SOBBING rises faintly over them. We're on the roof of a house, and a figure with its back to us is doing the crying. The figure drinks from a bottle. A long, hard pull. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Coming around thefrontwe see the figure is Adam McCarthy, Frank and Sheila'sson,sitting on the roof of his house, staring out at thecityand getting quietly shit-faced. \nCUT TO: \nINT BE. ROOM DAY Tom pries his eyes open, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's 10:26. \nTOM Oh, man... He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes. \nTOM Uh... Frank? But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside. \nEXT FRONT PORCH DAY It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention. Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt. Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The other taunts him with cries of \"Chicken!\" Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him, headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back. He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed, jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there -- -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside. \nTOM Oh, God... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is locked. He POUNDS on it. TOM (coast' d) \nADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!! He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the window beside the door and peers through it. \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living room. \nON THE PORCH, \nTOM Oh, God, no! Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window. \nINT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the house. He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he clutches a 38 with a carved white handle. \nTOM Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please... He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's chest, trying to stop the bleeding. TOM (cont' d) This is really happening.., it's really happening... \nCUT TO: \nEXT OUR BLOCK DAY Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official activity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house. Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've obviously been told something serious has happened and they're desperate to get inside. They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but that's about the only good sign, they're working on him frantically. Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's horrified SCREAM. \nCUT TO: \nINT LIVING ROOM NIGHT CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it. The word \"Cacophony\" is legible. Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go. \nTOM We need some answers, right? Maybe they're the only ones who have any. She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring. \nMAGGIE I'm sure they're very nice people, but in case they aren't -- She hands a thin black cannister to him. MAGGIE (coat' d) Mace the shit out of `em. He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him. \nEXT DINGY STREET NIGHT Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night, checking addresses. He stops and looks up, at an old, formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times. \nINT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress (VIVIAN) smiles at him. \nVIVIAN I hope you like fondue! \nINT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's leaking stuffing. \nVIVIAN Dip away! \nTOM Thank you. Listen, is, uh -- Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils. TOM (coat' d) Is there a guy named Neil here? He's a cop? \nVIVIAN Well, of course he is! She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY, her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this one with a red background instead of blue. Beverly serves two people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the other a HOMEY in his early twenties. Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot, full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and flits off across the room. Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM What does what want me to do? \nHERMAN You saw a ghos-, didn't you? \nZ 'M Yeah. Twice. t. girl that disappeared from my neighborhood. Now the kid next door just tried to kill himself. I think he knew something, but now I'll never know what it was. And I gotta know. \nHERMAN Look, what'd the bitch want? \nTOM Why do you assume she wants something? \nNEIL They always do. Something they need finished, something they can't do any more. \nTOM Why me? \nNEIL Because she's confused. Doesn't know why other people won't answer her. She only knows that you will. If she hasn't asked for something yet, she will. And once they ask, it's very difficult to stop yourself from doing it. \nTOM What do you mean? She can, it can make me do something I don't want to do? \nNEIL Oh, no. You'll want to. Badly. You won't think about anything else. You won't sleep. You won't eat. You'll lie. And God help anyone who tries to stop you. \nTOM What if I stop me? What if I just don't do it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nHERMAN Then you got a weird bitch friend for the rest of your life. \nNEIL Just listen to her, Tom Let her tell you what she wants. \nCUT TO: \nINT PHILIP'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY NIGHT A HAND pounds on an apartment door. Philip opens up. He was asleep. \nPHILIP What, what, what? \nTOM I want you to hypnotize me again. \nINT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT Tom paces the floor in Philip's apartment. \nPHILIP Just slow down, you gotta be a little patient with me here, `cause, um... well, Tom, Tom, I've got a confession to make. See I, I, I just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in, so this shit you're tellin' me here is fuckin' with my mind just a little bit extra, okay? Tom grabs a chair from Philip's desk and sits. \nTOM Do it. \nMOMENTS LATER, they sit face to face. \nPHILIP Okay. Close your eyes. Tom closes his eyes. \nIN THE BLACK, PHILIP (o.s.) Just like last time -- I want you to concentrate. Listen to the room around you. Tom listens. The factory CHURNS softly outsioi the windows. A few CARS in the street below. His BREATHING. PHILIP (cont' d) Now focus. Concentrate. Look at the backs of your eyelids. Do you see anything there? \nIN PHILIP'S APARTMENT, \nTOM (opens his eyes) Would you just get to it, please? \nPHILIP All right, all right. Tom closes his eyes again. PHILIP (cont' d) I want you to pretend you're in a movie theatre. \nTOM She told me what she wants. \nCUT TO: \nEXT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE DAY Maggie's Sentra pulls into the driveway of their house, parking behind Tom's phone company truck. She gets out, dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags of groceries out of the trunk. She looks at Tom's truck, then at her watch. Home already? \nINT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE DAY Maggie comes in the front door. \nMAGGIE (calling out) Hey! You're home early! She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries. MAGGIE (cont' d) Can you pick up Jake? I'm exhausted! She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her. Tom's nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there is a faint CRUNCHING sound. MAGGIE (cont' d) Hello? No answer. She heads into the kitchen with the groceries. \nINT KITCHEN DAY In the kitchen, a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax machine on the counter. Maggie stops in the doorway, staring at the floor. Muddy footprints lead into and out of the kitchen, through the door to the back. Thick chunks of wet mud are everywhere. \nMAGGIE Hey, look what I'm not cleaning up. She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk. She opens the refrigerator. She does a double take. The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice. From outside, the CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows the muddy footprints out the kitchen door. \nEXT BACK YARD DAY The back yard is smallish, but it's a nice little patch of grass. Used to be, anyway, because now there are three large holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations. Large piles of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes. Tom stands in one of t1.e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a large pick axe high over his head. CRUNCH. He brings the pick down, into the hole. Busy guy. Maggie is aghast. She walks slowly across the yard, past a pile of shovels and buckets and other tools. She draws closer to him. \nMAGGIE Tom? Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard. CRUNCH. The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three feet deep. But, hey, it's early. Maggie draws closer. In between swings -- MAGGIE (coast' d) Tom. Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His shirt's off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat. Maggie jumps back. \nTOM You scared me. And with that, he turns back to the job. Swing. CRUNCH. \nMAGGIE S scared you? Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE (cont' d) Tom. Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE (cont' d) What are you doing? \nTOM (doesn't turn around) I'm supposed to dig. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Swing. CRUNCH. Maggie walks around him, so she's facing him. He keeps working. \nMAGGIE What do you mean? Zom shrugs. Swings the pick. \nTOM I'm supposed to dig. \nMAGGIE Who says? He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows. You know who. MAGGIE (cont' d) Oh. Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the pick. He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the grass at Maggie's feet. She jumps out of the way. He hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He sprays water into the hole. MAGGIE (cont' d) Why are you doing this? \nTOM Water softens up the dirt. He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in the hole and starts to dig. \nMAGGIE No, I mean... Could you stop for a minute? (he keeps digging) Would you please stop for a minute? \nTOM What don' t you get? I'm supposed to dig. \nMAGGIE \nTOM! I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP FOR ONE \nMINUTE! He looks up, supremely irritated, and leans on the shovel. \"Well?\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) MAGGIE (coat' d) M2y are you digging? \nTOM (isn't it obvious?), I'm searching. \nMAGGIE What are you searching for? \nTOM The question isn't \"what.\" We both know very well \"what,\" even if we don't want to may it out loud. The question, Maggie, which, as you can plainly see, I am very busy trying to answer -- the question is \"Where?\" \nMAGGIE Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you come?! But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard. \nTOM I'm just... kind of in the middle of something here. She looks at him, absolutely incredulous -- -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb. \nCUT TO: \nEXT DRIVEWAY DAY Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back window of Maggie's car. He raises one hand, waving. Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud- stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back. The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down the block. Jake and Maggie are gone. \nEXT BACK YARD DAY There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far corner. He stops short. Hose won't reach. \nAT THE SPIGOT, he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard. \nAT ANOTHER SPIGOT, this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns on the water. Nothing comes out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM Come on! Tom curses and trudges back toward the house. \nINT KITCHEN DAY Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen. \nINT DINING ROOM DAY Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the middle of the closet floor. Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts to climb down. \nINT BASEMENT DAY As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl space, barely enough to wriggle through. Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on. WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot. He turns to climb back up the ladder. And stops. He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt. He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking. \nA FEW MINUTES LATER, the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the earthen walls. He works. \nEXT OUR BLOCK DAY It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's pick axe falling echoes over the block. \nINT BASEMENT DAY Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone, right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge. Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks. \nCUT TO: \nINT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels, picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking. The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking. At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says \"FOR RENTAL ONLY\" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews use to bust through whatever's in their way. Tom's face lights up. \nEXT STREET DAY The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck, rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate. Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and bring it into the house. \nIN THE STREET, Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it. Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor. Lenny stares at him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She stops and stares too. \nINT BASEMENT DAY In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space, sweating and straining, lowering the thing down. It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer. \nA BIT LATER, Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety cord. He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life. He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power. Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and squeezes the handles. The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to split in half. Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in his basement. \nEXT STREET DUSK As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops and SHOUTS something at Tom's house. Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to? \nCUT TO: \nINT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT A group of PEOPLE IN DARK CLOTHES mill around a living room, muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE What? \nJAKE I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I don't want to go home. \nMAGGIE Why not? \nJAKE Because I'm not safe there. Because of the feathers. \nMAGGIE What does that mean, Jake? He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to the other room. \nPHILIP It's okay, I can watch him. Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on the forehead. \nMAGGIE Be good. She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut: \nJAKE Don't stop for the train, Mommy. \nEXT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her. She misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her car. She walks faster. Then she runs. \nCUT TO: \nINT BASEMENT NIGHT In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the pile. He bends down and pulls it out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it. \nAN IMAGE flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses. \nIN THE BASEMENT, Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it sticks on something. Something buried. Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was. More blue plastic. Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up. Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit. Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again. \nTHE DIRT, flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously. \nTOM'S FACE is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can. \nFINALLY, Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed. Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic, wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and two and a half feet wide. Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches. \nAN IMAGE pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in winter, waving to us to come up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIN THE BASEMENT, Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows. He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He slides the ra or blade forward. He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back. The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand. Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi- colored bracelets. Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half- decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest heaving. He looks at her hand, thinking. He sits down next to her. He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back. Can't do it. But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He slides his hand underneath -- takes a deep breath -- -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones. He GASPS. His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue, and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he first saw her in his living room. \nEXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us, coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered with plastic Duvateen. The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFIGURE Hi! \nSAMANTHA (off screen, we're in her point of vie sr) Hi. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) KURT (cont' d) Just be nice to me. Be a good girl. You're a good girl, aren't you? \nSAMANTHA I have to go home. We struggle some more. He gets his powerful hanis on our shoulders and starts to push us down. \nKURT Come on, baby, how `bout a little helmet wash? His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We tear away, get up and run for the door. From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood. Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy, vomiting in the corner. Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling. Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger. Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again. KURT (cont' d) \nSHUT UP! SHUT UP! Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain. In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears. \nADAM \nMAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP \nSCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP! But she keeps screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that's sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG comes on, loud. It's a haunting tune, we recognize it. St's the song Jake has been humming. Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing her hand out of his hair. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nKURT \nSHUT HER UP! USE YOUR JACKET OR \nSOMETHING' Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet -- -- and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue demon as he grapples on top of us. \nIN TOM'S BASEMENT, Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He thrashes. \nIN THE HOUSE, back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and fainter and fainter... and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt and Adam SCREAMING at each other. The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces, looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their car. \nADAM Oh, my God. \nKURT What the fuck did you do that for? \nADAM Is she dead? \nKURT No shit she's dead. \nADAM Oh, my God. \nKURT Look at her tongue, man. \nADAM I'm not here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKURT I never saw nobody dead before. We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor. Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away. Their voices fade. \nADAM I wish I wasn't here. \nKURT It's fuckin' gross. \nFRANK You don't know it was Adam and Kurt. \nTOM It was. \nFRANK But there's nothing to... you're talking like a nut, that's what people will say. This is just a body, it doesn't prove anything. \nTOM No, it doesn't. He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand. He pries open her fingers. She's clutching a tuft of hair. TOM (cont' d) But this probably will. Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb. Finally, he turns his back. His shoulders heave as he cries, silently. \nEXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT In the misty night, the figures of Harry and Kurt Damon come out of their house and skulk across the street, toward Tom's. \nEXT ROAD INTO TOWN NIGHT Maggie drives, as fast as she can. Up ahead, red lights flash and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks. Train coming. Cars are stopped, waiting for it. Maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line -- -- then thinks better of it. She drops the car in gear, hauls it around the others, and bolts for the tracks. The train, nearly upon her, BLARES its horn. Maggie flies across the tracks and SLAMS through the gate on the other side, a split-second before the train HURTLES through the intersection behind her. She cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the other side, and pulls it back on the road. She drives on, shaking like a leaf. \nINT BASEMENT NIGHT Frank is still sobbing, his back to Tom. Tom takes a step toward him, to comfort him. \nTOM \nFRANK- \nFRANK I mean... \nTOM Frank, we have to- \nFRANK I mean, what were we supposed to do? Tom stops. FRANK (cont' d) The kids come to us, she's already dead, the damage is done, there's nothin' gonna bring her back. But those boys, they've got everything ahead of them. Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right hand. He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle. He turns and looks at Tom. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: FRANK (coast' d) What were we supposed to do? Send our boys to jail for the rest of their lives? Our own flesh and blood? Over her? \nE3 T HOUSE NIGHT Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the front steps of Tom's house. They look up and down the block. There's no one out. No one to see. \nINT BASEMENT NIGHT Frank still has the gun hanging at his side, tears streaming down his cheeks. \nTOM Who you planning to shoot with that? \nFRANK Who do you think? \nTOM I think you haven't decided yet. He's right, and Frank knows it. \nFRANK Get out of here. \nTOM What are you gonna do, Frank? Frank raises the gun, in a fury. \nFRANK \nI BEEN LIVIN' WITH THIS FOR ALMOST A \nYEAR, YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU SAY IS \nGONNA MAKE ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO \nME?! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! \nTOM Frank, I won't go until you- Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls the trigger. The bullet CRACKS off the ladder. \nFRANK \n", "test1_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE Did you, uh, get her name? \nTOM You know, she didn't menti. -in it. \nMAGGIE You sure you weren't dreami.g? \nTOM Positive. I had this headache like you wouldn't believe, and I was thirsty as hell. \nMAGGIE What should we do? You want to call Philip? \nTOM Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't think he's got a fuckin' clue in life. From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on the TV. \nMAGGIE How about my cousin Elizabeth? \nTOM I don't need brain surgery, I just had a weird thing happen, that's all. Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time deal, don't worry about it. \nMAGGIE Well, if anything like this happens again, we should go talk to Elizabeth. \nTOM Maggie... \nMAGGIE Promise me. \nTOM I promise. \nCUT TO: \nEXT HOUSE DAY There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide with the red lights. Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house. He hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at the front of his own house. \nHE REMEMBERS one of the images that blasted through his mind last night. It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way -- \"C'mon in.\" But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat. \nBACK IN THE PICKUP, Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as \nTHE FOOTBALL BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal \nCLANG. Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY, seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed. \nTOM Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me! The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches for the football. Tom beats him to it. TOM (cont' d) You gotta play right here in the middle of the street? Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over his shoulder. \nFRANK Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your own grandfather . \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM (looking at his hood) Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even my truck. They're gonna dock me for this. \nFRANK That'll pop right out. Use one of them plunger things. Adam, say you're sorry. \nADAM I'm really sorry, Mr. Witzky. \nFRANK There you go, he said he's sorry, whaddya want from a kid. Let's go. Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a great-looking seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's hand. Tom looks at him. \n", "test1_true": "IN THE TRUCK, Tom gets back in and closes the door. \nFRANK That Damon kid, he's gonna break your old passing records this Friday. \nTOM Bound to happen some time. \nFRANK Comin' to the game? \nTOM (starts the car) Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin' HARRY (o.s.) Hey, Tom! Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is staring out the window, looking right at Tom. Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now. HARRY (cont' d) Thought I'd stop by and pick up the rent. Save you the trip across the street. \nTOM It's still two days yet, isn't it? Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house. \nHARRY Yeah, just thought you'd want to get it out of your hair. \nTOM \n(DISTRACTED) Well, my checkbook's inside. \nHARRY I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we picked to miss last night, huh? How many yards Adam end up with? Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision. \nFRANK Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns. Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling away. \nCUT TO: \nINT SIGNAL DIVISION DAY The signal division of the local phone company has a large main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows a forest of jagged, blinking lines. \nIN THE TOWERS, Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards. He pulls a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he cuts in on a \nWOMAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) (on phone line) -which was okay, I guess, but then he told me he loves me, and it was just like, oh my God, can you please make yourself any less attractive? Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line. Now it's a \nSNEAKY MAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) -unless they find out we already locked in with Cooper at eighty, so it's imperative we lead them to believe we're honestly trying to-, Tom clips to another line. It's a SEXY WOMAN'S VOICE. VOICE (o.s.) -start at my lips and lick your way all the way down to my- Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human. The voice abruptly changes. VOICE (coast' d) Hey, did somebody pick up on your end? Is your wife there? Tom unclips and picks another line. He gets a dial tone. He enters a number on his headset. A SLEEPY VOICE answers. \nTOM Phil, it's Tom. Is there anything else important you said to me last night, while I was under? \nINT PHILIP'S APARTMENT DAY Philip (Maggie'a brother) is still in bed in his apartment. It's a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a lovely view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the air. Philip's hung over. He holds the phone like he resents it. \nPHILIP What time is it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TOM (o.a.) Quarter after eight. What are you, still in bed? \nPHILIP Quarter after eight? Jesus, Tom, this is barbaric. \n(INTERCUT) \nTOM Other than the shoe thing, what else did you say to me? \n", "test2_input": "ELIZABETH You've had no head trauma, no serious viral infections you can recall, you haven't been out of the country, you're not a drug user, you have no history of migraines... I suppose I could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to do, but I'd rather take a few pictures first, wouldn't you? She pushes through a set of double doors. \nINT MRI ROOM DAY The MRI machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out obscenely, like a tongue. TWO NURSES stand on either side of it. One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass are the TECHNICIANS -- and Maggie, who waves supportively. Tom swallows. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTOM How's it work? Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some commands. \nELIZABETH It creates an electromagnetic field thirty thousand times stronger than the earth's. That stimulates your brain's protons to align themselves. Then we shoot radio waves into you, which knocks the protons out of alignment. They then realign themselves, sending out radio signals we record on the scanner. The computer reads the signals and makes a series of detailed cross-sections of the layers of tissue. Tom looks at the machine, then back at her. \nTOM Can I have another Valium? \nA FEW MINUTES LATER, Tom lies down on the \"tongue.\" The Nurses wrap sheets around his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them. He looks at one of them questioningly. \nNURSE So your arms don't touch the sides of the machine. \nTOM That would be bad? She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over his hair. \nNURSE 2 Your party hat. He tries to smile, but he is unnerved. Elizabeth leans in, staring down at Tom. \nELIZABETH It's so nice you and Maggie finally came to see me at work. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, a Technician hits a series of switches. \nIN THE MRI ROOM, the tongue starts to move, sliding into the tunnel. Tom lies still, staring upward as he is pulled inside, like a corpse in a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue. \nINSIDE THE MACHINE, it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom. Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a stop. It's incredibly claustrophobic. \nTOM Kinda hot in the coffin. ELIZABETH'S VOICE comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel. \nELIZABETH \nYES, IT USUALLY IS AT FIRST, BUT IT \nCOOLS DOWN ONCE THE HAMMERS START \nMOVING. \nTOM Yo, hey, hey, woah, I'm right here. Can you turn it down a little bit? \nELIZABETH \nNO, YOU'LL WANT IT LOUD. WE'RE \nSTARTING NOW. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a Technician. \nELIZABETH Go ahead. The Technician enters some commands on a keyboard. \nIN THE MRI ROOM, the giant \"hammers\" that are contained in the cylinders that surround the tunnel start to move, slowly at first. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Elizabeth turns to Maggie. \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: \nELIZABETH Did he bring any music? \nMAGGIE Yeah, right here. She hands him a cassette. Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck and pushes \"play.\" \nIN THE MRI ROOM, the hammers pick up speed, and these things move. It gets noisy fast. \nIN THE TUNNEL, Tom's eyes widen. The hammers whip faster. Their POUNDING is tremendous. Tom's music starts playing from the speakers. It's The Doors, \"People Are Strange.\" The hammers whip faster. Elizabeth was right, it's good the music is loud, because the sound coming from the hammers is deafening, like gunshots going off all around his head. \nELIZABETH \nTRY TO RELAX. THIS'LL ONLY TAKE AN \nHOUR OR SO. Tom, in spite of himself, bursts out laughing. \nIN THE CONTROL ROOM, they can hear the thundering hammers, the blaring music, and above it all, Tom's crazy kind of laughter. Elizabeth looks at Maggie. \nCUT TO: \nINT CONTROL ROOM DAY Three electronic screens, two red and one whitish-blue, display various cross-sections of Tom's brain. Graphs and columns of numbers are listed alongside. \nELIZABETH No tumors, no growths, no scars or lesions, no intrusions or damaged tissue of any kind. Except for one tiny abnormality, your brain anatomy is textbook. Physically, anyway. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAGGIE What abnormality? \nELIZABETH Well, it's so insignificant it's hardly worth mentioning. She leans forward to one of the screens and points to a spot on a cross-section. ELIZABETH (cont' d) It's the parietal lobe. Here. There's a slight distension, just the tiniest bulge here in the arc of the crescent. That's uncommon. \nMAGGIE How uncommon? \nELIZABETH One in a half million, maybe, it doesn't really have a name. But it isn't consequential. Wouldn't have any effect on cognitive processes. \nTOM Great. There's nothing wrong with me, I gotta get back to work. (stands and shakes hands) Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, I owe you a giant one, hey, you think I can get some of that Valium to go? Elizabeth scowls at him. TOM (cont' d) Worth a try. Take care, say hi to Michael. (to Maggie) I'll pick up Jake, I told him I'd take him to the Pier tonight. He heads for the door, eager to get the hell out of there. Maggie lingers, looking at Elizabeth, hopeful. \nMAGGIE There's really nothing wrong with him? Nothing at all? \nELIZABETH Maggie. I said nothing physical. \nCUT TO: \nINT BEDROOM DAY Maggie is in the bedroom, cleaning up. She picks up Tom's pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over one arm. Something THUNKS to the floor. She picks it up. It's the butterfly knife, the one he took from Duane. She stares at it, fascinated and frightened. She lets it drop open. There is dried blood on the blade. Gingerly, she closes it again. She opens a drawer and puts it in, then thinks better of that. She takes it out again, looks for a place to put it. She drops it in her purse and zips it shut. She'll deal with it later. \nCUT TO: \nEXT NAVY PIER NIGHT Navy Pier is an amusement park/shopping mall built on a pier jutting out into Lake Michigan. It's a nice night, the pier is crowded, just enough urban edge to be interesting. A figure bobs along above the crowd -- Jake, sitting on Tom's shoulders. They stop and join a CROWD watching a JUGGLER, a good one, keeps five burning pins in the air. Jake suddenly looks up, confused by something. He stares past the juggler, through the flames. Behind the juggler, a UNIFORMED COP is staring at the little boy -- it's the same Cop who was parked outside their house earlier. Jake stares back, the flaming pins flying up between them. Tom moves on, his boy still on his shoulders. The Cop turns and watches them go. Jake turns, looking back over his shoulder at the Cop. The Cop raises a hand and waves. Jake just stares. \nAT A TOY STORE, there is an elaborate model train set on display in the window. \nJAKE Daddy, look! \nTOM Woah, check it out. He stops, helps Jake down off his shoulders. Jake presses right up against the glass, staring at the train as it circles the track. Tom squats, admiring it with him. \n", "test3_input": "MAGGIE So... you know most of the people around here pretty well, right? \nIN FRONT OF BERNIE'S TAP, somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three drunks. On the pavement. Ouch. \nIN THE CROWD, Tom is now talking to Harry Damon. \nHARRY But, you know, what am I gonna do, I'm a single father with a son to support, I can' t just say fuck everything. So I scraped together enough money to make a few downpayments, and here I am. A landlord, for Christ's sake. \nTOM So you've been in this neighborhood a long time, right? \nMAGGIE is questioning Sheila. \nMAGGIE Did you ever hear of a girl named Samantha Muller? \nSHEILA \n(THINKS) From over by Baldwin? \nMAGGIE I think so. \nSHEILA Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell. \nHARRY DAMON, in response to the same question from Tom, calls over to his son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who is leaning against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple other guys. \nHARRY Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller girl? (to Tom) Like he ever tells me anything. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The music coming from the car is too loud, Kurt can't hear. HARRY (cont' d) \n(SHOUTING) \nDO YOU REMEMBER THE -- COME OVER HERE ! He gestures. Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters over. HARRY (cont' d) Do you remember that Muller girl? \nKURT What, Dorothy? He makes a \"big breasts\" gesture. \nHARRY No, the other one. Samantha. Lenny, the crank, joins the conversation. \nLENNY You mean the retard? She ran away. \nHARRY She did? \nSHEILA is on the same subject. \nSHEILA She was always hanging around the guys, you know, she wanted to be with the \"in\" clique and everything. There wasn't much chance of that. \nHARRY DAMON, asks Tom a question. \nHARRY Why you wanna know about her? \nTOM Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes and she started talking about her sister, wonderin' how she was doing and stuff. I promised her I'd ask around, see if anybody'd heard anything from her. \n(CONTINUED) - - - Ambb. - - - - - Nft - & a r- \nCONTINUED: \n", "test3_true": "TOM )id she ever live in that house we're .n? Frank comes up, one arm around his son Adam. \nFRANK Who? \nHARRY No. You're the first tenants since I bought it. \nLENNY (to Harry) Harry, I saw those Dominicans back in the park again. By the basketball courts? \nHARRY What do you want me to do about it, Lenny? \nLENNY We could go talk to `em. Scare `em off, if there were enough of us. \nFRANK Yeah, Lenny, they're gonna be terrified of you. \nSHEILA keeps talking to Maggie. \nSHEILA She was a pretty girl, but real shy. Pretty simple. She had these crazy ideas she could be an actress, you know. She thought she was gonna be a big movie star. I mean, there was no way, but you couldn't tell her that. I thought it was kind of sad. \nFRANK AND ADAM have joined Tom and the others. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFRANK (to Tom) Two one one. \nTOM Okay. \nFRANK \nTOM Got it. \nFRANK Two hundred eleven. \nTOM I give up, Frank. \nFRANK (puts his son in a hammerlock) Two hundred and eleven yards rushing the other night. That makes eight ninety-four with two games to play, kid needs a hundred and six, that's only fifty-three a game. He could walk through the rest of the season and hit a thousand. \nADAM (pulling free) Dad... Behind them, the guys playing football out of Bernie's Tap have now organized a full-fledged game of tackle in the street, over the objections of their wives and girlfriends, who shout at them to stop. \nFRANK I embarrass him. Are there worse things that can happen to a human being? \nTOM Hey, Adam, way to go, man. \nADAM \n(SHYLY) Thanks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTOM (to Harry) Well, if you hear anything about her, lemme know, okay? \nFRAZ. X About who? \n"}

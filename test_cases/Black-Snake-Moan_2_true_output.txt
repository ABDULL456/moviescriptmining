LAZARUS You better pray, gal. You better pray... 
ROSE (yanks free) Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME! 
The whole cafe is silent. All eyes are on Rose. 
ROSE (to customers) Yeah, go'on! Look! See if I give a shit about any of you people! 
And she's gone, right out the front door.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Tehronne is taking his time hanging his ice around his neck and wrists as he stands shirtless before the mirror. Rae is lying on the bed. 
RAE You got any money? 
TEHRONNE Thought you had a man for that. 
RAE (a heavy cough) I said we wasn't gonna talk about him. 
TEHRONNE What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me. 
RAE Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to. 
TEHRONNE What'd I tell you? (kicks the bed) I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now. 
RAE Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'. 
Rae starts coughing. 
TEHRONNE Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead. (takes out his wallet) Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick? 
RAE Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it. 
TEHRONNE (takes out money) Alright. How much you need, ho? 
RAE The hell you call me? 
TEHRONNE Eh, if the bootie fits... 
Tehronne catches Rae's wrist as she goes to slap. He quickly yanks her arm behind her back and bends her backwards, shoving his face close to her own. He grips the money in a fist and cocks it to punch -- all in jest. 
TEHRONNE You gonna get rough? Is that what you doin'? 
Rae's chest begins to heave with deep breaths. Tehronne looks down at her legs as she anxiously rubs them together. 
TEHRONNE (shakes his head) I swear, I seen some buck-wild bitches in my time, but you the illest I ever seen. 
Rae gets control of the burning. She takes the money. 
RAE Just got a cough.

EXT. FISHERVILLE SQUARE - DAY 
Rae is prancing up the walkway on the square. Two young men dressed for construction pass Rae. 
MAN It's already noon, Rae. You think that skirt should still be on? 
RAE (flips them off) If it weren't you could kiss my rebel cootch, ya faggot. 
The men keep walking as Rae coughs. She turns toward the Fisherville Grocery. 
SANDY Cough drops or condoms? 
Rae stops in her tracks, looking up at her estranged mother, SANDY, smoking a cigarette outside the grocery store. Sandy has bleached hair with dark roots. She is in her late-forties: once a sexy girl, now she's lost all her tread. 
RAE (surprised to see her) Didn't know you was workin' here now? 
SANDY I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests. (takes a drag) Your money ticket get shipped today? 
Rae walks away -- deeply affected by Sandy's presence. 
SANDY (calling after her) You let me know if I can be of any assistance. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MELVIN'S FEED STORE - DAY 
Laz drives an old green Ford pick-up. He pulls the truck up to the front of the feed store and kills the engine.

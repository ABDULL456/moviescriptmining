SEAN (V.O.) I guess we never thought of each other like that. PJ (V.O.) Me neither, dawg. PJ and Sean think is over, nod and shake hands. BILL (V.O.) You see... (turning to camera) 'California is my family'... Cut to angle on Bill and the gangbangers playing basketball, having a wonderful time. BILL (V.O.) If we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go. 
Bill flies by, obviously from an O.S. trampoline, and soars over the gangbangers for a monster dunk. Freeze on:     the two awestruck "gangbangers."

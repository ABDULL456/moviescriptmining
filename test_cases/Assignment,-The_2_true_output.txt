They stand at the barbeque as Joey plays shooting hoops. Ramirez holds Yolanda. Ramirez and Jack speak quietly. 
JACK Mrs. Meir is dead, Lieutenant Commander. 
RAMIREZ Then you might want to have them dig her up because I intend to sue her. 
Jack chuckles. 
JACK Commander Ramirez when I said I was from the government, perhaps I should have been more specific. I'm from the CIA. 
Jack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album-like briefing book. He opens it up and hands it to Ramirez. On the first page there is an 8Ã—10 enlargement of a photo of Carlos entering a building. It is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez. 
JACK Does the man in that picture look familiar? 
Ramirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that Jack had when he saw Ramirez for the first time. 
YOLANDA Poppi... 
RAMIREZ That's not me... I mean I know it looks like me... but... 
JACK I know it's not you. 
RAMIREZ It's... this Carlos guy. 
Just then, Joey yells from the tree he's in. Jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency. 
JOEY Poppi, you don't need to watch the fire, come climb with me. 
RAMIREZ Get out of that tree, Joey. Your mother sees that and I'm dead. 
Now when Jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones. 
JACK This is the only recent shot we have of him... telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the Israelis. Can you blame 'em for what happened? The only difference is the eyes. 
Ramirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance. 
RAMIREZ Okay I get it now, you're here to talk me out of my lawsuit. But see I identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after I told 'em who I was so... 
JACK Lieutenant Commander, I am not here about your lawsuit. Carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world. He's personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history. Men, women, children. Children like yours... blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood. Annibal... why did you join the Navy? 
RAMIREZ (as if by rote) To serve my country. 
JACK To serve your country... to protect her from her enemies. Well Carlos is one of her enemies now. And he'll probably become a bigger one... terrorism... unfortunately is a growth industry. 
RAMIREZ Why are you telling me all this? 
JACK Lieutenant Commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after Carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. There is exactly one person in the world who can help us get Carlos. And that person is you. 
RAMIREZ What do you mean... to get him? 
JACK All I can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. It will involve a high degree of risk. That much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. But if we succeed Carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. Now I know you're going to need some time to think about it so... 
RAMIREZ No I don't need any time. The answer's no. 
JACK Annibal... 
RAMIREZ Lieutenant Commander... I am a Naval Officer... that's what I was trained for... that's what I'm good at... See you came to the wrong address. You want James Bond. He lives in London and he's got an Aston Martin. You can't miss him. 
We HOLD on Ramirez's look and Jack's half-smile. 
INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - NAVAL BASE - NORFOLK - EVENING 
The Officers' Club is decked out for a reception for ADMIRAL CRAWFORD. All the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a Navy string quartet plays softly in b.g. There is a reception line and the Admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line. 
NAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Commander and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft. 
CRAWFORD I know your family well, Commander, I was with your father at the Academy. I expect great things from you Ward... great things. 
SCOWCROFT I won't let you down sir. 
Next up are Ramirez and his wife Maura. 
NAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez. 
CRAWFORD Annabelle?! 
RAMIREZ (smiling) It's Annibal sir. 
CRAWFORD Yes... of course... well ... I'm glad to see we're getting some Mexican American officers in the ranks. I'm an L.A. boy myself so I have a real soft spot for authentic Mexican food... My stomach doesn't always go along with it but... 
MAURA We'd love to have you over to dinner Admiral but the cuisine would be Cuban not Mexican. I think your stomach would find it more agreeable... not to mention your taste buds. 
CRAWFORD You're Cuban Americans... oh I'm sorry... you grow up in L.A. and you hear Ramirez and... anyway it was a pleasure meeting you.

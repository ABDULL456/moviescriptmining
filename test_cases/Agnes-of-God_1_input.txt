MARTHA Did it hurt? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Where? 
AGNES Down... there. 
MARTHA And what did you do? 
AGNES I went to my room. 
MARTHA And what happened? 
AGNES I got sicker. 
MARTHA 
And then what? 
AGNES I fell asleep. 
MARTHA In the middle of all the pain? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Where did the baby come from? 
AGNES What baby? 
MARTHA The baby they made up. 
AGNES From their heads... 
MARTHA Is that where they say it came from... ? 
AGNES No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! 
MARTHA Where'd it come from before that? 
AGNES From God. 
MARTHA After God... before the waste-paper basket. 
AGNES I... I don't understand. 
MARTHA Agnes, how are babies born? 
AGNES Don't you know? 
MARTHA Yes I do,    but I want you to... 
AGNES (very agitated) I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants 
to talk about    the baby but... I never saw the    baby so I can't talk about the baby    because... I don't believe in the    baby. 
MARTHA Then let's talk about something else... 
AGNES (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. 
MARTHA (also standing) Agnes... 
AGNES (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions. 
MARTHA Would you like to ask them?

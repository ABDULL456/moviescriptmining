SARA Uh oh. Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd. 
SARA 
(SHOUTS) Tracy. Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd. 
SARA 
(LOUDER) Tracy. Don't. Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara gasps. 
STEPHEN Damn! Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd. Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up. 
STEPHEN Oh. Woops. 
SARA 
(ANNOYED) I have to go clean this up. She turns. 
STEPHEN Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him. 
SARA What plan? 
STEPHEN To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation. 
SARA You spilled beer on me purposely? 
STEPHEN 
(NODS) You pissed? She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen. 
SARA I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile. 
SARA I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand. 
STEPHEN Come on. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR 
Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of the punch. 
SARA It's pretty good. She drinks some more. 
SARA It doesn't taste that strong. 
STEPHEN Exactly. He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of hers. 
STEPHEN Stephen. By the way. 
SARA Sara. 
INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER 
Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup. Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs, grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her, bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand. 
SARA Hey, why do you get to drink beer? 
STEPHEN Twenty-one. 
SARA Old man. 
STEPHEN Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest. 
STEPHEN Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands. 
SARA Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch. 
KIM

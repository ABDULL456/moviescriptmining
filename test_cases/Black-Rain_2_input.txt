NICK 
still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead. 
KOBO'S FINGERS 
as they reach for the plate. 
NICK 
grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate, shattering it in a half-dozen pieces. 
Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face. 
NICK Keep the change. 
Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows. The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way mirror in New York. 
Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen... 
FADES TO BLACK. 
BLACK SCREEN 
The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down. 
The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES... 
FADE IN: 
INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS 
Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights. 
OHASHI 
is at his desk studying a report. 
Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the electric typewriters. 
Ohashi looks up to see -- 
ICH 
walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches. 
Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to Ohashi's desk. 
ICH 
stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention. 
ICH Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents captured prisoner Kobo, Chief Inspector Ohashi. 
Ich salutes. 
OHASHI Inspector Ohashi will take charge of the prisoner. 
Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal -- 
NICK 
standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's also bandaged and on crutches. 
Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the main switch up.  The lights and fans start working. 
He turns and walks out the door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER 
A small decoration ceremony. 
ON ICHIRO 
getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress uniform. 
In the far corner 
NICK, JOYCE AND 
Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the ceremony. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY 
Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left arm in in a sling. 
NICK Can't make you change your mind? 
JOYCE Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. 
NICK Might be different in New York.

The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston Havlock LAUGHING. 
WINSTON Here I come, laddies! 
O'Connell braces himself for impact, 
SAHARA - DAY 
Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep. 
EVELYN Stop it! You'll kill them! 
Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard. 
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs. 
EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY 
The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside- down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down. 
JONATHAN Excuse me... A little help would be useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!! 
O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead. 
A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away. 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND... 
HAMUNAPTRA - DAY 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra. 
O'CONNELL Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? 
JONATHAN He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. 
O'CONNELL Got it. 
HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY 
Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell. 
NECROPOLIS - DAY 
Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward. 
BENI Keep moving. 
Evelyn gives him a look. 
EVELYN You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance. 
Beni suddenly looks worried. 
BENI Yeah? 
EVELYN Oh yes, always. 
Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall. 
JONATHAN I say, look at that. 
He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE. 
JONATHAN Say, gents! You should come have a look at this. 
The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM. 
O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away. 
The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job. 
O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM! 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life. 
Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE. 
Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed. 
TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

He plays an eight and takes in the whole pile. 
MELBA It's not my game. 
The telephone RINGS. She stands up. 
MELBA Want to know what is? 
CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the phone. She picks it up. 
MELBA (into phone) Hello -- Oh, hi, sugar -- why not? 
She reaches a hand around to the back of her neck, fiddles with her dress a moment, then beckons in The Kid's direction. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE KID 
He doesn't understand what she wants but he gets up and comes to her obligingly, CAMERA MOVING with him. 
MELBA (into phone) What's the switch? 
She points to the hook-and-eye fastener at the top of the zipper that runs down the back of her dress. The Kid pantomimes the question "What for?" but she just wiggles her finger impatiently at the fastener while speaking into the phone. 
MELBA (into phone) Whose idea was that? 
The Kid still doesn't know what she has in mind but it seems easier to humor her than not. He unfastens the hook. Melba smiles her thanks and, to his consternation, reaches back and pulls the zipper all the way down. She places her hand over the mouth-piece of the phone. 
MELBA (to Kid) He's not coming home now. 
She steps out of the dress. 
MELBA (into phone) Whatever you say, Shooter man. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH, PLUSH HOTEL - THE SHOOTER 
SHOOTER (into phone) Explain to The Kid, will you? 
INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID 
Melba in her bra and panties, snuggles against The Kid. 
MELBA (into phone) He'll understand. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH, PLUSH HOTEL - THE SHOOTER 
SHOOTER (into phone) Tell him they decided to play a little longer, and I'll call him at his place later when the game's over... Right. Goodbye, honey. 
He hangs up the phone and emerges from the booth. CAMERA MOVES with him as he joins Felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance. 
INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID 
The Kid, his policy toward this new situation still unresolved, holds her lightly while he tries to think it out aloud. 
KID Listen, Melba -- 
MELBA I have to tell you first. You're sitting down with Lancey next Monday night. 
KID I wish it was sooner. I wish it was tomorrow. 
MELBA Shooter'll give you all the details later. 
KID I don't like waiting that long. 
MELBA Let's not kick a gift horse in the teeth, sugar. We've got this time together. Let's try to "fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run." 
She invites a kiss and he obliges her. But there is a contrary force at work inside him. 
KID Listen, what I was going to say before, I don't want you to think I'm being some kind of jerk or I don't feel you'd be great to sack up with. 
MELBA Then let's cut the filibuster. 
KID I've made dolls that were friends of mine's wives. I figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their husbands, I wasn't. 
MELBA Of course. Any other attitude, you're degrading the woman. You're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own, but as somebody's property. 
Again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment. 
KID Only thing is, it's different with The Shooter than anybody else. He's so straight, I got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people. So do you. On account of we both owe him plenty. 
MELBA I thought we just agreed that what you and I did was strictly between us. 
KID Can't be. (decisively, pulling away from her with a pat of dismissal) Shooter's the closest thing to family I got. It's almost like he was my old man. Don't you see how that's got a bearing on us?

{"test1_input": "ANDREW Whacked with a racquetball. (taking Wheeler's hand) I appreciate your faith in my abilities. \nWHEELER Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. It doesn't apply to this situation. (slapping his shoulder) Go home. I mean, get back to work. \nAndrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment. \nANDREW (warmly, softly) Thanks, Charles. \nWHEELER (with a father's affection) No sweat, buddy. \nSmiling, Andrew exits the office. \nCLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING... \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then... \n... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way football players do when then score a touch down, saying \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" to himself, soundlessly. \nThe SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his little dance and starts to laugh. \nSmiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS at Helena and says: \nANDREW (in a funny, kind of medieval way) It's good to be King. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY) \nTITLE: \"Ten days later.\" \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY) \nIt's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful. \nA YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend CHANDRA. \nCHANDRA (O.S.) You want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can, Andy. You don't want to look like you've thrown it on with a spoon. \nANDREW (O.S.) Uh huh. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup. Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend, BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV. \nCHANDRA Okay. You try. \nAndrew tries applying makeup to his face. \nANDREW Chandra? Don't you think this color's a little... orange for me? \nCHANDRA Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions. \nALAN Think of it as the \"I just back from Aruba\" look. \nIN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in Andrew's \"work area\": desk, personal computer, etc.). \nBRUNO I got it. \nBruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple. \nANDREW (giving the fax a quick scan) Thanks, Bruno. (to Alan and Chandra) I've been out of the office four days. I don't want them to think I've been to the beach. (searching for something) Okay. Check this out. \nAndrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames, meant to help conceal the blotches. \nANDREW (CONT.) Hides everything, right? What do you think? \nCHANDRA You know who you look like, Andy? That actor, in that movie. Not the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera... \nALAN Dustin Hoffman. \nANDREW (horrified) Tootsie! \nBRUNO Right. \nCHANDRA You want to try Light Egyptian? \nSuddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut. \nCHANDRA (CONT.) What? \nANDREW (clearly in pain) Excuse me a sec... \nAndrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN. \nCHANDRA Just like my cousin Fredo. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR slamming shut. \nBruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door. \n", "test1_true": "CONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nTIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ... \nAndrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping it's over for now. \nANDREW I think I need to go to the hospital. \nCUT TO: \nMIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson Hospital (EXT./DAY). He hustles up the ramp toward the Emergency Entrance... \nCUT TO: \nMIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING \nANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over his shoulders, fighting chills. \nChandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and goodbyes. \nANDREW Thanks, you guys. \nMIGUEL Yeah. Thanks, guys. \nMiguel puts his arms around Andrew. \nANDREW Gillman's out of her office today. I told her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it? Did you get someone to cover your class? \nMiguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever. \nMIGUEL Don't worry about it. They took blood? A specimen? \nAndrew holds an empty specimen cup. \nANDREW Aren't you giving an exam? \nMIGUEL I said, don't worry about it. \nMiguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead. \nMIGUEL (CONT.) You got a fever, baby. \nSuddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes. \nANDREW I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody. \nMIGUEL (holding him) So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay? \nAndrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in control of his emotions once more. \nANDREW Wait, here's my guy... Hey! \nAndrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose surgeon's greens are covered with blood. \nINTERN Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry... \nANDREW About my blood work? \nINTERN We're waiting... \nMiguel opens a small notebook, making notes. \nINTERN ... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside. \nANDREW Sounds delightful. \nMIGUEL Why do you need to do this? \nINTERN Who are you? \nMIGUEL Who are you? Doctor... ? \nANDREW This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal. \nINTERN Dr. Klenstein. (to Andrew) It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away. \nMIGUEL It could be parasites, an infection... \nANDREW A reaction to AZT... \nKLENSTEIN That's possible, but. \nMIGUEL He's not going through some painful procedure until we've cancelled out everything else. \nINTERN I'm trying to help your \"partner.\" You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER. \nANDREW (to the Intern) He's upset, he's sorry. \nMIGUEL Don't apologize for me. \n", "test1_id": 1584, "test2_input": "WHEELER Good luck, Andy. \nWheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out. \nAndrew doesn't move. \nA SECURITY GUARD enters the room. \nANDREW Who are you? \nSECURITY GUARD I'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings. \nCUT TO: \nCAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ... \nJOE Okay. Explain to me like I'm a two year old, because there's an element to this I can't get through my thick head: Didn't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, infectious disease? \nAndrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to disguise the effects of chemo. \nANDREW The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position... \nJOE Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake? \nANDREW Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today. \nJOE Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file. \nANDREW They sabotaged me. \nJOE I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case. \nANDREW Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons... \nJOE Correct. I don't. \nAndrew rises, thoroughly business-like. \nANDREW Thanks for your time. \nJOE Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head. \nANDREW (a smile) Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet. \nAndrew exits. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR (DAY) ... \nIRIS (still uncomfortable, as Andrew's leaving) Have a nice day. \nAndrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY. \nJoe approaches Iris's desk. \nJOE Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon. \nFILKO (still staring) What the hell's wrong with him? \nCUT TO: \nTHE STREET: ANDREW EMERGES FROM THE LAWYER'S BUILDING (EXT./DAY). CLOSE ON ANDREW, standing there as an endless flow of people passes by. He watches them go, thinking... \nCUT TO: \nA SUBURBAN DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD (EXT./DAY) ... \nDR. ARMBRUSTER (OS) You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nA DOCTOR UNRAVELLING A BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE (INT./DAY) \nJOE I'm not worried. What are you doing? \nJoe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Checking your blood pressure, relax. \nThe DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm. \nJOE I didn't have contact. What do you consider \"contact?\" We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet... What if you shake hands? Wait. I know the answer. Only sex, or sharing needles. I know that. We didn't shake hands, anyway. \nDr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump, \nDR. ARMBRUSTER The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen. \nJOE Right. \nJoe begins rolling down his sleeve. \n", "test2_true": "JOE Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: \"whoops! We were wrong.' You can carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing? \nDr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER We're going to draw blood. \nJOE Why are we going to do that? \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life. \nJOE You want to give me an AIDS test?! \nJoe HOPS off the table. \nJOE (CONT.) The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right? \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Right. \nJOE It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right? \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about... \nJOE Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really. \nJoe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK: \nJOE (CONT.) In my past? \nARMBRUSTER IV drug use. \nJoe shakes his head. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER (CONT.) A homosexual encounter. \nJOE Get real. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Unprotected sex with a prostitute. \nJOE (thinking it over) Uh.... No. Not really. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years. \nA MOMENT. \nJoe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING: JOE'S HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS (EXT./NIGHT) ... \nLISA (VOICE OVER) You have a problem with gays, Joe. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nJOB CRADLES HIS BABY AGAINST HIS CHEST (INT./NIGHT) ... \nJOE Not especially. \nLisa eats standing up, at the stove, while Joe walks the BABY in their modern kitchen. \nLISA How many gays do you know? \nJOE How many do you know? \nLISA Lots. \nJOE Who? \nLISA Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets. \nFor a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says: \nJOE Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... lesbian? \nLISA Duh... \nJOE Since when? \nLISA Probably since she was born. \nJOE Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me. \nLISA Okay, Joe... \nJOE I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? \"Is that mine? I thought it was yours.\" Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is. \nLISA Fine, Joe. \nJOE And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't stand that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you. \n", "test2_id": 1585, "test3_input": "A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a loose circle, like a casual living room. \nJoe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand. \nWheeler is looking across the room at... \nAndrew, who catches Wheeler's stare. \nWHEELER You're looking better, Andy. How do you feel? \nSILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction. \nANDREW Fine, thanks, Charles. \nJUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton. \nJUDGE GARNETT Charles, Walter... \nWHEELER Congratulations on the new grandson. \nJUDGE GARNETT Thank you. We're very happy. \nThe Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat. \nJUDGE GARNETT Attorney for the plaintiff? \nJOE Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services. \nJUDGE GARNETT I've seen your television commercials. \"If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, \"through the negligence of others.\" \nJOE I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT On behalf of the defendants? \nBELINDA CONINE Belinda Conine. Of Petersen, Lehigh, Monroe and Smith. \nJEROME GREEN And Jerome Green. \nAnd a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses: \nDEXTER SMITH Dexter Smith. \nA white-haired lawyer next to Belinda: \nRALPH PETERSEN Ralph Petersen. \nJUDGE GARNETT (to Joe) You're outnumbered four to one. (to the others) Whom do I address? I can't talk to four lawyers at once. \nBELINDA I'm chief litigator, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT Fine. I've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... There is nothing I hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. And when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. And when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages. \nJOE If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter. \nJUDGE GARNETT By God you will settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today? \nJOE Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and... \nJUDGE GARNETT Hold it, Joe. (to Wheeler) He wants to come back to work, Chuck. \nWHEELER That's impossible, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT That's impossible, Joe. \nBELINDA CONINE If it please Your Honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars. \nJOE Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago. \nJUDGE GARNETT Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut through these false attitudes. Give them a figure. How much do you want? \nANDREW I want to go back to work, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT You're here at my indulgence, young man. I'm waiting for a figure, Joe. \nAndrew and Joe confer with each other. \nJOE Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars. \nJUDGE GARNETT Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I... \nAndrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge: \nJOE One more thing, Your Honor... \nANDREW (jumping in) Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work. \nCharles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine. \nBELINDA CONINE Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit. \nANDREW I was the one who was sabotaged. \n", "test3_true": "JEROME GREEN We have letters. \nJOE Why haven't you produced these letters? \nJUDGE GARNETT Take it easy. (to Wheeler) What's the big deal, Chuck? The boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone. Why are you being hard- assed about this? \nWHEELER I wish I could exonerate you, Andy. But I'd have to lie to do it. \nANDREW (very calm) You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer. (rises) Gentlemen. (to Belinda) Counselor. \nWHEELER Don't do this, Andy. \nJOE Whoa, whoa... (to Andrew) What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz? \nKENTON A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying? \nANDREW I think I catch your subtle drift, Walter. \nAndrew saunters out. \nKENTON You'll be sorry, Beckett. \nWHEELER Andy, you don't want this. \nJoe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into a grin. He faces the Judge. \nJOE With all due respect, Your Honor, my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial. \nJoe exits. \nCUT TO: \nHAND HELD CAMERA SHOT OF: THE FRONT YARD OF A TWO-STORY Colonial house in Downington, Pennsylvania (EXT./DAY) ... \nAndrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA. \nANDREW This is the house where I grew up.

{"train": "\"Philadelphia\", by Ron Nyswaner \nPHILADELPHIA \nby RON NYSWANER \nSeptember 21, 1992 \nFADE IN: \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ... \nwhich may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market, scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the ghettos of North Philly. \nMAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a SHOT OF... \nCUT TO: \nPHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ... \nTITLE: \"Philadelphia City Hall.\" \nCITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS pour into City Hall, into... \nTO: \nTWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY). \nYoung lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football. \nJamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP. \nJamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time \nTO: \nJAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS making a racket... \nJamey rushes toward a door marked \"JUDGE TATE.\" \nRAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers: \nJOSEPH MILLER (OS) This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public! \nANDREW BECKETT (OS) My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor! \nJamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT (in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes). \nJUDGE TATE One at a time. Mr. Miller? \nJOE Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage! \nANDREW Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results... \nBehind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs a document into Andrew's hand. \nANDREW (CONT.) Limestone. Messy, but innocuous. \nAndrew submits the report to the Judge. \nJOE Innocuous? \nANDREW Defined by Webster's as harmless. \nJOE I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?! \nHis back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to Jamey: \"Not bad.\" But he whips around, serious again: \nANDREW Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society. \nJudge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers. \nJUDGE TATE Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. I thought we were talking about some dust. \nCUT TO: \nA MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ... \nAs soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro- cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing. \nANDREW                      JOE ... plaintiff seeks to re-     ... whereas decedent had strain defendants from con-    pre-existing asthmatic tinued improper use of trade   condition and ride on name without...                Ultra Loop caused sub- sequent death... \nAndrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other... \nAnd turn toward the corner, seeking privacy. \nANDREW (CONT.)              JOE (CONT.) ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks authorization...               relief... \nThere's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their portable telephones at the same time. \nThey look at each other: which phone is ringing? \nRACHEL I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing. \nANDREW Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall. \nAndrew SAILS toward his office. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY). \n... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them. \n... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall. \n... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk. \nThe SCREEN SPLITS, REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR: \nOPERATOR ... Karen Hargreave, representing Lloyd Management Corporation? \nThe SCREEN SPLITS INTO THIRDS: Andrew, the OPERATOR, and HARGREAVE (a sharp, California lawyer.) \nHARGREAVE Present. \nAs the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF LAWYERS in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES) saying \"Present\" while in Andrew's section of the screen... \n... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line, \nOPERATOR Andrew Beckett, representing Saunders International? \nAndrew punches into the conference call \nANDREW Present. \nThe MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden, answering a portable phone. \nSARAH Hello? \nANDREW Hi, Mom. It's me. \nThe LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's conversation with his mother). \nSARAH Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon? \nANDREW I'm fine. \nSARAH What's Dr. Gillman say? \nANDREW Hold on, Mom. (punching into the conference call) There's no way my client will go along with that. \nHARGREAVE Who's this? \nANDREW Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm sorry I interrupted... \nHe punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut). \nANDREW (CONT.) Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ... (conference call) Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns. (back to Mom) My platelets look good too. \nSARAH Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold. \nCUT ON ANDREW'S LAUGHTER TO: \nTHE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.) \nTITLE: \"One-thirty a.m.\" \nCUT TO: \nANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ... \nAndrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer. \nNeeding a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather than a book.) \nAndrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a relevant citation: \nANDREW Ah hah! Yes! (chewing a string bean) Rentworth v. Pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations... \nA SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT. \nANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says: \nKENTON Look at this fucking guy. He's an animal. \nAndrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard. \nANDREW Walter. \nThe SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos. \nSEIDMAN Are we interrupting, Andy? \nANDREW Whacked with a racquetball. (taking Wheeler's hand) I appreciate your faith in my abilities. \nWHEELER Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. It doesn't apply to this situation. (slapping his shoulder) Go home. I mean, get back to work. \nAndrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment. \nANDREW (warmly, softly) Thanks, Charles. \nWHEELER (with a father's affection) No sweat, buddy. \nSmiling, Andrew exits the office. \nCLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING... \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then... \n... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way football players do when then score a touch down, saying \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" to himself, soundlessly. \nThe SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his little dance and starts to laugh. \nSmiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS at Helena and says: \nANDREW (in a funny, kind of medieval way) It's good to be King. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY) \nTITLE: \"Ten days later.\" \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY) \nIt's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful. \nA YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend CHANDRA. \nCHANDRA (O.S.) You want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can, Andy. You don't want to look like you've thrown it on with a spoon. \nANDREW (O.S.) Uh huh. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup. Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend, BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV. \nCHANDRA Okay. You try. \nAndrew tries applying makeup to his face. \nANDREW Chandra? Don't you think this color's a little... orange for me? \nCHANDRA Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions. \nALAN Think of it as the \"I just back from Aruba\" look. \nIN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in Andrew's \"work area\": desk, personal computer, etc.). \nBRUNO I got it. \nBruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple. \nANDREW (giving the fax a quick scan) Thanks, Bruno. (to Alan and Chandra) I've been out of the office four days. I don't want them to think I've been to the beach. (searching for something) Okay. Check this out. \nAndrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames, meant to help conceal the blotches. \nANDREW (CONT.) Hides everything, right? What do you think? \nCHANDRA You know who you look like, Andy? That actor, in that movie. Not the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera... \nALAN Dustin Hoffman. \nANDREW (horrified) Tootsie! \nBRUNO Right. \nCHANDRA You want to try Light Egyptian? \nSuddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut. \nCHANDRA (CONT.) What? \nANDREW (clearly in pain) Excuse me a sec... \nAndrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN. \nCHANDRA Just like my cousin Fredo. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR slamming shut. \nBruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door. \nANDREW He's not sorry, okay, fine. (the diplomat) Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy? \nINTERN Allright. I'll get on the lab about the blood work. \nMIGUEL (to the Intern) I'm sorry. \nThe INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS. \nANDREW That's the third time. I better call the office. (smiling at Niguel) Would you relax, please? \nMIGUEL I am relaxed. \nAndrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE, where weary relatives are watching TV. \nAndrew drops a quarter into the phone. \nJOE MILLER'S VOICE \"If you or someone you know...\" \nANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the words \"Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents\"... and in the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS. \nJOE (CONT.) \"... has been injured through the fault of others, you may be entitled to legal remedy... \nAndrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered: \nANDREW Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been beeping me, I... Okay, okay, calm down. Put Jamey on. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nFIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK (INT/DAY), GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES... \nJAMEY (frantic) Andy?! This is a disaster! We can't find your revisions on the Kronos complaint! \nANDREW Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's sake! \nJAMEY I went down to Word Processing to pick up the corrected copy, but they said you haven't delivered the corrections. I told them you've been working on it at home, and... \nAndrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important. \nANDREW I brought it in last night, around midnight. It's in my computer. \nJAMEY What did you file it under? \nJamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard. \nANDREW K-R-O-one. \nJamey types the file name. \nANDREW (CONT.) Jamey, I don't have to mention, do I, that we're up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in... (checks his watch) Seventy-five minutes. \nJamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor. \nJAMEY It's not here, Andy. \nAndrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this. \nANDREW You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now! Or they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes from me! \nAndrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle. \nHe pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself: \nANDREW (CONT.) Every problem has a solution. Every problem... has... a... solution. \nCalmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt. \nANDREW (CONT.) Every problem has a solution... \nMiguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen. \nMIGUEL Why are you getting dressed? \nANDREW You're not going to like this. Please try to smile... \nAndrew puts his arms around Miguel. \nANDREW (CONT.) Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... (pulling back, putting on his jacket) I will be back. An hour, tops. \nMIGUEL You're going to the office?! \nANDREW You're not smiling. \nAndrew rushes toward the exit doors. \nMIGUEL You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane? \nANDREW One hour! \nMIGUEL Drew! \nANDREW I promise! \nSEIDMAN You'll never find it in the dark. \nSeidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches. \nSeidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on. \nSEIDMAN (CONT.) What in God's name... ? \nANDREW Bob... \nSEIDMAN What's wrong with your face? \nANDREW What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint? \nSEIDMAN Allright. Calm down. \nANDREW Sorry... \nSeidman sits in front of Andy's computer. \nSEIDMAN What was the file name? \nANDREW K-R-O-one. \nSEIDMAN Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters... \nSeidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder. \nANDREW You're right, I probably just misfiled... \nKENTON (O.S.) Andy? \nWalter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is casual. So casual it seems a little forced. \nKENTON (CONT.) Some sort of problem? \nAndrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton. \nANDREW Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major problem. \nHOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW... \nSOUND OF A BABY CRYING CROSSES THE CUT TO: \nA NEWBORN BEING LIFTED INTO A DOCTOR'S HANDS (INT./DAY) ... \nDOCTOR There she is, okay. You can relax now, Lisa. \nLISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in pain, quietly crying a little. \nTITLE: \"One month later.\" \nThe NURSES and the (FEMALE) DOCTOR move professionally around the bed, doing their jobs. \nAt Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby. \nJOE Oh my god... a girl... oh my god... Lisa... oh my god... \nHe's frantic. \nJOE (CONT.) You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby! \nLISA Give me the camera, Joe. \nLisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back. \nJOE Thanks, hon. Oh my god... \nWith wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS. \nJOE (CONT.) Oh my god... oh my god, look at her... oh my god... \nCUT TO: \nJOE, WALKING THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, STILL WEARING SURGEON'S greens, SPEAKING INTO HIS PORTABLE PHONE (INT./DAY) ... \nJOE Go to Famous Fourth Street and buy a pound of Nova. No! She likes Scotch salmon better. Ah heck, get a pound of both! Get a dozen onion rolls. Get some bagels. Get a dozen. Get a bottle of champagne. Dom Peringon... A hundred bucks a bottle?! Better get a good California... \nPassing a PATIENT IN TRACTION, ROLLING BY ON A GURNEY, Joe drops a business card into the PATIENT'S broken hand. \nJOE (CONT.) (to the PATIENT) Give me a call. (into the phone) Get everything over here as soon as you can, she's starved. No, not the baby! Lisa! ... Iris, listen: any calls I should know about? ... Uh huh... Uh huh... Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett? \nTurning a corner, Joe comes face to face with HIS RELATIVES, who charge at him joyfully: \nJOE'S MOTHER/AUNTS/UNCLES, ETC. Congratulations! How is Lisa?! When can we see the baby?! \nCUT TO: \nQUIET... JOE, LISA AND THEIR BABY CUDDLED TOGETHER IN Lisa's hospital bed, surrounded by debris from a party, paper plates, empty champagne bottle (INT./NIGHT) ... \nThe relatives have gone. It's late at night. \nJOE Uh, yeah. \nAndrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure. \nJOE (CONT.) Go ahead. \nAndrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.) \nANDREW (the cigars) New baby? \nJOE One week old. \nANDREW Congratulations. \nJOE Little baby girl. \nANDREW Kids are great. \nJOE Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. (glances at his watch) What can I do for you? \nANDREW I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners. \nJOE You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown? \nANDREW Correct. I'm seeking representation. \nJOE Continue. \nANDREW I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine? \nJOE How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me? \nANDREW Nine. \nJOE Continue. \nANDREW I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it. \nJOE We? \nANDREW My lover and I. \nJOE Your... lover? \nANDREW Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years. \nJOE Continue. \nANDREW I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started... \nSUDDENLY PICTURE CUTS TO: \nTIGHT ON ANDREW WAUKING THROUGH THE LOBBY OF THE WHEELER Building (INT./DAY). He's wearing MAKEUP, which sort of covers the blotches. (NOTE: PICTURE and ANDREW'S VOICE OVER do NOT match up. This is no ordinary flashback) ... \nANDREW (VO) (CONT.) First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back. Then... my face. For a short period, I avoided the office during the day, waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions... \nIMAGE: ANDREW RIDING THE CROWDED ELEVATOR ON A WORKDAY. \nANDREW (VO) (CONT.) But I never let anything slide. I made all my calls from home. I worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a 350 million dollar copyright infringement suit. \nIMAGE: JOE IN HIS OFFICE, ABSORBED IN ANDREW'S STORY. \nANDREW (OS) (CONT.) But the day the complaint was due, it disappeared. Erased from my computer. I thought I was losing it, mentally... \nIMAGE: ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING, ANDREW STEPPING INTO WYANT WHEELER OFFICES. NOW HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA: \nANDREW (CONT.) That can happen, it's called AIDS dementia when it gets into your brain. But miraculously, a copy of the complaint was located at the last minute, and we got it to court on time... \nIMAGE: ANDREW'S POV OF COLLEAGUES, STAFF IN THE OFFICES, GIVING HIM LOOKS, WHISPERING. ANTHEA BURTON NODS HELLO. \nANDREW (OS) (CONT.) The next morning, I was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners. Walking down that corridor was strange. Felt like everyone was staring. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON ANDREW AND JOE WALKING AT ANDREW'S SIDE. \nJOE Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face? \nANDREW Makeup. \nANDREW'S POV: RACHEL OUTSIDE HER OFFICE, SAYS \"GOOD LUCK.\" \nANDREW (CONT.) The partners were waiting for me in the main conference room. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nCAMERA TRACKS INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM, GIVING US ANDREW'S POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Bob Seidman are waiting (INT./DAY) ... \nWHEELER Sit down, Andy. \nWheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes. \nWHEELER (CONT.) Thanks for coming in. \nWHEELER Good luck, Andy. \nWheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out. \nAndrew doesn't move. \nA SECURITY GUARD enters the room. \nANDREW Who are you? \nSECURITY GUARD I'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings. \nCUT TO: \nCAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ... \nJOE Okay. Explain to me like I'm a two year old, because there's an element to this I can't get through my thick head: Didn't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, infectious disease? \nAndrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to disguise the effects of chemo. \nANDREW The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position... \nJOE Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake? \nANDREW Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today. \nJOE Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file. \nANDREW They sabotaged me. \nJOE I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case. \nANDREW Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons... \nJOE Correct. I don't. \nAndrew rises, thoroughly business-like. \nANDREW Thanks for your time. \nJOE Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head. \nANDREW (a smile) Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet. \nAndrew exits. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR (DAY) ... \nIRIS (still uncomfortable, as Andrew's leaving) Have a nice day. \nAndrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY. \nJoe approaches Iris's desk. \nJOE Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon. \nFILKO (still staring) What the hell's wrong with him? \nCUT TO: \nTHE STREET: ANDREW EMERGES FROM THE LAWYER'S BUILDING (EXT./DAY). CLOSE ON ANDREW, standing there as an endless flow of people passes by. He watches them go, thinking... \nCUT TO: \nA SUBURBAN DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD (EXT./DAY) ... \nDR. ARMBRUSTER (OS) You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nA DOCTOR UNRAVELLING A BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE (INT./DAY) \nJOE I'm not worried. What are you doing? \nJoe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table. \nDR. ARMBRUSTER Checking your blood pressure, relax. \nThe DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm. \nJOE I didn't have contact. What do you consider \"contact?\" We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet... What if you shake hands? Wait. I know the answer. Only sex, or sharing needles. I know that. We didn't shake hands, anyway. \nDr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump, \nDR. ARMBRUSTER The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen. \nJOE Right. \nJoe begins rolling down his sleeve. \nLISA That's perfectly clear. \nCLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA: \nJOE Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: \"I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to breathe on me?\" \nCUT TO: \nTHE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th St. Deli, with a package (EXT./DAY) ... \nTITLE: \"Two weeks later.\" \nCUT TO: \nJOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN saunters by (INT./DAY) ... \nA CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE: \nAndrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose. \nJOE (under his breath) Shit... \nJoe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him. \nJOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS: \nAndrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes something. Sneezes. \nA LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew. \nLIBRARIAN This is the supplement. You're right, there is a section on... (lowers her voice) ... HIV related discrimination. \nANDREW Thank you. \nAndrew takes the book from her -- but she remains. \nLIBRARIAN We have a private research room available. \nANDREW I'm fine, thanks. \nAndrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching. \nLIBRARIAN Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room? \nANDREW (pleasantly) No. But would it make you more comfortable? \nLIBRARIAN Whatever, sir. \nThe LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating she's done all she can do. \nAs Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks up his books and moves away. \nJoe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, who concentrates on his work. \nJoe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by. Suddenly he \"notices\" Andrew. \nJOE Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'? \nANDREW Fine. \nAndrew goes back to his work. \nJOE Who'd you get? \nANDREW What? \nJOE Find a lawyer? \nANDREW I'm a lawyer. How's your baby? \nJOE Huh? Oh. Great. She's great. \nANDREW What's her name? \nJOE Rayisha. \nANDREW Rayisha. Very nice. \nAndrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away. \nJoe comes back. \nJOE How did they find out? \nANDREW (a second, then:) One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead. \nNearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she hears the word \"lesion.\" \nJOE Uh huh... \nAndrew concentrates on his work once more. \nDR. J. Gentlemen... Ladies... \nJULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS. \nLAWYERS How's it goin', Doctor?/This is an honor!/etc ... \nThe door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING Joe Miller (in jeans and basketball jacket) and a MARSHALL. \nJOE Excuse me. Charles Wheeler? \nWheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand. \nJOE (CONT.) Summons. For you. \nNOW the box is QUIET. \nDR. J. Say. What's up, Chuck? \nCUT TO: \nTHE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM Stadium (INT./NIGHT) where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman, with Walter Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS OF THE GAME STILL IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY. Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY SERVICE EMPLOYEES... \nWHEELER ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did any of them know Andy was sick? How did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street? \nSEIDMAN Jesus. \nWHEELER (ignoring Seidman) What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are? \nSEIDMAN Charles... \nWHEELER What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? (with irritation) What is it, Bob?! \nSEIDMAN Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us. \nThey arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac. \nWHEELER Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic. \nKENTON We ought to be suing him. \nSEIDMAN For Christ's sake, where's your compassion? \nKENTON Compassion? Andy sucks cocks, Bob. He takes it up the ass. He's a pervert. \nOnly Seidman shows any kind of REACTION. \nSEIDMAN That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business. \nWHEELER Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, \"I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?\" \nSEIDMAN He was doing a great job. \nWHEELER Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say \"I might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability?\" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God. \nKILLCOYNE Beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty settlement. \nSEIDMAN A jury might decide that Andy has a case. \nWHEELER Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob? \nKENTON Holy Shit. Did you, Bob? \nSEIDMAN (after a moment) No. Not really. \nWheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne. \nBob Seidman stands alone in this dark place. \nCITY SOUNDS ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO: \nEXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ON A THURSDAY MORNING. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nJOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in Joe's offices, INT./DAY): \nFILKO Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?! \nJoe sweeps by, just arriving for work. \nJOE Morning, Filko. \nFilko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes: \nCOLLEAGUE Hey, it's the local chapter of the ACLU! \nFILKO You're a Republican, Joe! You belong to the NRA! \nJOE How many toilet stalls are there in the women's restroom on this floor, Filko? \nFILKO How many... what?! \nSARAH Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. (he keeps it pointed at her) Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen. \nANDREW Where's Dad? \nSARAH He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower. \nOne of Andrew's YOUNG NEPHEWS SHOVES HIS FACE into the CAMERA, UNTIL SCREEN GOES BLACK. \nCUT TO: \nQUIET (INT./DAY) ... \nAndrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers, MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there. \nAndrew sits next to Miguel. \nANDREW Things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my private life. And I want to make sure it's okay with everybody. \nMATT I appreciate you asking, Andy, but really, it's your call. \nANDREW What do you think, Jill? \nJILL To be honest, I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy. They've had to go through so much already... And, we all know... (very difficult to say) There's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. I wonder if it's fair to put them through this. \nAndrew's father STARES at his folded hands. \nANDREW Mom? \nSARAH All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights. \nANDREW Thanks, Mom... Dad? \nThere's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks. \nBUD Supposedly, the Lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle. But I'm having a hard time believing that these days. \nAndrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain. \nBUD (CONT.) Andy, the way you've faced this whole thing, you and Miguel, with so much courage... your mother and I have been so very impressed... \nAndrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts an arm around Andrew. \nBUD (CONT.) I can't imagine there is anything, that anyone could say, that would make us feel less proud of you. \nANDREW (full of emotion) Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you, Randy? \nRANDY Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy. That's the bottom line. I mean, what are those bastards going to say? You're gay? Shit, I knew that when you were five years old. \nEveryone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five. \nMIGUEL Wait a minute... (to Andrew) You're gay? \nMore laughter. But Jill speaks seriously: \nJILL What about you, Andy? You're not a militant type. You've always been so private. \nCLOSE ON ANDREW: \nANDREW I guess... I don't have time for that any more. \nSARAH Jim? Will you lead us in a prayer? \nEveryone bows heads, holding hands in a circle. \nREVEREND JIM Dear Lord. Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful... \nCAMERA PANS THE CIRCLE, THE PRAYING FACES. \nREVEREND JIM (CONT.) To remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have You to turn to, and each other. Bless and keep Andrew and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead. Bless and watch over all of us, fill us with Your love, Your light, and Your peace, which passeth all understanding. In Jesus' name, we pray... \nEVERYONE Amen. \nROMANTIC MUSIC CROSSES CUT TO: \nBECKETTS' LIVINGROOM, SEEN THROUGH THE VIDEO CAMERA (DAY) ... \nA local entertainer (GUIDO PAONESSA) launches into a standard, accompanied by a single guitar player, and Bud and Sarah begin to dance, surrounded by family and friends. \nGUIDO \"After all the days of Spring have flown...\" \nVIDEO CAMERA PANS: RELATIVES eating cake, KIDS chasing each other, a GRANDMOTHER in a wheelchair holding a NEWBORN, watching silent, video home movies. \nCAMERA FINDS Andrew and Niguel eating anniversary cake (Andrew barely touches his). Playing for the camera, Miguel dips his finger into icing and smears it onto Andrew's nose. Andrew tries to reach the icing with his tongue. \nCAMERA PANS WITH ANDREW as he comes forward to dance with his mother, while Jill dances with their father. \nCAMERA RETURNS TO MIGUEL. MATT (behind the camera) says: \nMATT (OS) Hey, Miguel, can you imagine any two people being together for forty years? \nZOOM IN CLOSE ON NIGUEL (who's watching Andrew): \nLAIRD We were satisfied. \nJoe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and disappoints them. \nJOE Were you satisfied, or were you pleased? \nLaird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering. \nLAIRD We were satisfied. \nJoe refers to legal documents. \nJOE Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct? \nLAIRD That's correct. \nJOE According to the deposition, you said you were \"thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed\" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that? \nLAIRD I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment. \nJoe takes on a street-tough tone: \nJOE Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not? \nLAIRD We won. \nJOE Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you? \nLAIRD It satisfied me. \nJoe STARES at the guy. \nJOE It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree? \nLAIRD I might. \nJOE Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind. \nLAIRD Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nJEROME GREEN CROSS-EXAMINING LAIRD (INT./DAY). \nJEROME GREEN Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit? \nMR. LAIRD That's right. \nJEROME GREEN Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial? \nMR. LAIRD Often, he does. \nJEROME GREEN As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders. \nLAIRD That's a fair assessment of the situation. \nAndrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets his gaze. \nCUT TO: \nSPECTATORS STREAM OUT OF CITY HALL INTO THE HUBBUB OF TWO DISTINCT GROUPS SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER (EXT/DAY): GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS in T-shirts with pink triangles, denouncing discrimination; BORN AGAIN ACTIVISTS waving placards citing AIDS as God's punishment for homosexuality; POLICEMEN keeping them apart; A MEDIA CIRCUS getting it on videotape. \nJoe and Miguel FLANK Andrew, who walks weakly. with a cane. Sarah and Jill follow close behind, running the gauntlet of ACTIVISTS and REPORTERS. \nAndrew's POV on a placard: \"We Die - They Do Nothing!\" \nJill's POV on a placard: \"AIDS Cures Homosexuality!\" \nA TV CREW shines HOT LIGHTS on Andrew. \nTV REPORTER (ANGELA MEDINA) Do you see this as a gay rights issue? \nANDREW I'm not political. I just want compensation for being fired. \nREPORTER MEDINA But you are gay, aren't you? \nIMAGE: ANDREW SEEN ON A TV SCREEN (INT./NIGHT): \nANDREW \"I don't see how that's any of your business... (a smile) But yes, I am.\" \nWIDE ANGLE: WE'RE IN A SPORTS BAR WHERE JOE WATCHES THE SIX O'CLOCK NEWS WITH FILKO, A LOCAL COP, OTHERS (INT./NIGHT) ... \nON THE TV SCREEN: A microphone is shoved at Joe. \nREPORTER MEDINA \"Do you believe that homosexuals deserve special treatment?\" \nFILKO Hell, no! \nJOE (on TV) \"Angela, we're standing in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, the birthplace of freedom, where our Founding Fathers authored the Declaration of Independence. And I don't remember that glorious document saying \"All straight men are created equal.\" I could have sworn it says, \"All men are created equal.\" \nCHARLIE THE COP Give me a goddamn break! \nANTHEA Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings. \nJOE Your earrings? \nAnthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings. \nANTHEA Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... \"ethnic\" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more \"American.\" \nJOE What did you say? \nANTHEA I said my earrings are American. They're African-American. \nJOE Thank you. No more questions. \nBelinda Conine approaches Anthea. \nBELINDA Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler? \nANTHEA Yes. \nBELINDA Were you recently promoted? \nANTHEA Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department. \nBELINDA Thank you. \nCUT TO: \nA PHILADELPHIA EXTERIOR, A FALL AFTERNOON (LATE DAY) ... \nCUT TO: \nJOE COMES DOWN AN AISLE OF A DRUG STORE, EXAMINING THE BABY cold medicines, carrying a box of Pampers (INT./DAY) ... \nA YOUNG MAN in grass-stained sweats, carrying a football under one arm, buying a tube of toothpaste, speaks to Joe: \nYOUNG MAN How's the trial going? It's a great case. \nJoe looks up surprised. The YOUNG MAN smiles. \nYOUNG MAN (CONT.) I saw you on television. I'm a law student. At Penn. \nJoe is flattered by the YOUNG MAN'S interest. \nJOE Good school. What year? \nYOUNG MAN Second. \nJOE Great. \nYOUNG MAN Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer. (a smile) I don't pick up people in drug stores every day. \nJOE Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think I'm... (low) ... gay? \nYOUNG MAN Aren't you? \nJOE What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you? \nYOUNG MAN Do I look gay to you? Relax. \nJOE Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you! \nYOUNG MAN Take it as a compliment. Geesh. \nBut Joe is really upset. People are watching. \nJOE Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys? \nYOUNG MAN Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? (walking away) Asshole. \nJOE You're the asshole, buddy. \nYOUNG MAN (going out) Get a life. \nJoe stands there, holding the Pampers, people STARING. \nCUT TO: \nLISA'S WORKING ON HER COMPUTER, AT HOME, WHILE JOE PACES around her desk, really upset (One year-old Rayisha sits on the desk playing with wooden salad spoons.) (INT./NIGHT) ... \nJOE But what was it?! What was this guy thinking... ?! \nLISA Don't know, Joe. \nJOE Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo vibe?! \nLISA Have you changed your aftershave? \nJOE Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake! \nCUT TO: \nANDREW I'm not ready to die. \nMIGUEL Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it! \nMiguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap. \nAndrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight. \nMIGUEL (CONT.) Please don't leave me. I love you so much. Don't die, don't leave me, please... \nMiguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his head, holding tight. \nANDREW I am so scared. I am so fucking, incredibly, fucking scared... \nA MOMENT. Andrew stroking Miguel's hair, as he calms down. \nANDREW (CONT.) You know, there's only one thing to do. (beat) We have to have a party. \nCUT TO: \nJOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- IN COSTUME. DANCE MUSIC is playing inside (INT./NIGHT) ... \nLisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal document stapled all over the suit. \nJOE Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties? \nLISA My lettuce is wilting. \nThe DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big hair, leather, guitar. \nANDREW (AS ROCKER) PARRTYY! \nJOE We're friends of Beckett's. \nANDREW It's me, you dork. \nLISA I'm Lisa Miller. \nANDREW Glad to finally meet you. Come on in. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nJOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (HE LIMPS, relying on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY). The room is filled with two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup (INT./NIGHT) ... \nANDREW (to Lisa) I have to introduce you to the can of soup. You can enter the costume contest together as a lunch special. \nMiguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX. He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff. Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then: \nANDREW This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez. \nMiguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS. Everyone ad libs greetings. \nMIGUEL My sister, Maria. (to Lisa) Pastrami on rye? \nLISA Corned beef. \nMIGUEL Want to dance? \nLISA Sure! \nMiguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up. \nJOE Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive... \nANDREW I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great. \nAndrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume. \nJOE I'm a law suit. \nANDREW Not bad. \nJOE Get it? \nANDREW Let's find you a drink. \nAndrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin painted blue (SMURFETTE) her daughter AMY (BART SIMPSON), Anthea, TYRONE from Dr. Gillman's office (A COWBOY), and TYRONE'S LOVER (A HORSE) ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS are here too, including the YOUNG ASIAN MAN who is now in a wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S SIBLINGS may be present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and some arty friends and neighbors. \nANDREW (CONT.) What do you want? \nJOE Beer. (patting his briefcase) We need to go over your Q and A. \nANDREW Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you? \nJOE Sure. It's fine. \nANDREW No, we have to do it. But later, allright? \nJOE Thank you. \nA MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes past Joe, reaching for a beer. \nJOE For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs. \nANDREW (no self-pity) There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial. \nJOE I've considered that. \nANDREW What happens? \nJOE We proceed, representing your estate. \nANDREW I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area... \nJOE I know a good probate lawyer. \nANDREW Thanks. (a beat) Do you like opera? \nAndrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him. \nJOE Opera? \nANDREW Want to hear my favorite aria? \nJOE Opera? \nSUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM -- startling Joe with its VOLUME. \nANDREW (over the MUSIC) Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is Madeleine. She's telling how, during the French revolution, a mob set fire to her house. Her mother died, saving her. \n\"I look... The place that cradled me was burning!\" \nDo you hear the heartache in her voice? Then, here come the strings. Everything changes. The music fills with hope. Madeleine says... \nAndrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed. \nANDREW (CONT.) \"It was during that sorrow that love came to me! \nA voice filled with harmony That said... Live still, I am Life!\" \n\"I am the god that descends From the heavens to the earth To make of the earth A heaven!\" \nANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable. \nANDREW (CONT.) \"I am Oblivion! I am Glory! I am Love, Love, Love!\" \nThe MUSIC ENDS. \nJoe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase organizing his notes. \nJOE I think I'll... I told Lisa. \nAndrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair. \nANDREW Right. \nAndrew follows Joe to the door. \nANDREW (CONT.) (businesslike) I'll look over the Q and A. \nJOE You're ready, don't worry. \nAn awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at their sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake? \nJoe gives a little \"salute,\" then leaves. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nJOE COMES DOWN THE HALLWAY OF THE MODERN CONDO BUILDING (INT./NIGHT) ... \nJOE Jesus. \nSuddenly, Joe HEARS: OPERA MUSIC PLAYING AGAIN. \nHe pauses, listening. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nANDREW MOVES THROUGH THE ROOM, DRINKING IN THE BEAUTIFUL, passionate MUSIC (INT./NIGHT) ... \nThe IV stand catches against the sofa, tugging the line. \nAndrew pulls the line out of his arm. He moves, freer now. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nJOE STANDS OUTSIDE ANDREW'S DOOR, OPERA MUSIC PLAYING (INT./NIGHT) ... \nJoe lifts his hand to KNOCK. \nHe changes his mind. \nJOE Fucking guy... \nJOE Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick. \nANDREW It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later. \nJOE You didn't look then, the way you look now? \nREVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.) \nANDREW No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was athletic. \nJOE A regular all-American guy? \nANDREW I suppose you could say that. \nJOE Except... you were gay? \nANDREW I still am. \nSPECTATORS CHUCKLE. \nJOE In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay? \nANDREW No. I didn't. \nJOE Can you explain why you didn't? \nANDREW You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club... \nIMAGE: WHEELER. ANDREW. SEIDMAN. OTHERS IN A LOCKER ROOM OF A TENNIS CLUB, WEARING TOWELS, ENTERING A SAUNA (INT./DAY). \nWHEELER Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal. \nANDREW I'm seeing him this afternoon. \nINSIDE THE SAUNA: CAMERA PANS SEVERAL MEN. \nANDREW (VOICE OVER) \"Somebody started telling jokes.\" \nFIRST MAN What do you call a woman who has PMS and ESP at the same time?. \nSECOND MAN What? \nFIRST MAN A bitch who knows everything. \nLAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the wall of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing. \nCHARLES WHEELER How does a faggot fake an orgasm? \nAndrew opens one eye. \nCHARLES WHEELER (CONT.) He spits on your back. \nSEIDMAN Charles, that's revolting! \nAll the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST. \nJOE (VOICE OVER) How did that make you feel? \nIMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS). \nANDREW Relieved. That I'd never told him I was gay. Very relieved. \nANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial. \nJOE Are you a good lawyer? \nANDREW I'm an excellent lawyer. \nJOE What makes you an excellent lawyer? \nANDREW I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. \nJOE What do you love about it? \nANDREW Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens. \nCUT TO: \nBELINDA CONINE STANDS BEFORE ANDREW (INT./DAY). \nBELINDA You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had \"an adventurous spirit.\" Is that correct? \nANDREW Something like that. \nBELINDA Do you take risks? \nANDREW In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to. \nBELINDA In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life? \nANDREW Not unnecessary ones. \nANDREW Some do. I didn't. \nBELINDA As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right? \nANDREW In some situations. \nBELINDA Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?! \nJOE Objection! \nBELINDA I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater? \nANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah. \nANDREW Yes. \nBELINDA You could have infected him, isn't that right? \nANDREW Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread. \nBELINDA Really? \nANDREW Yes. \nAndrew wipes sweat from his forehead. \nBELINDA You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct? \nANDREW That's right. \nBELINDA And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you. \nANDREW Absolutely. \nBELINDA Do you have any lesions on your face at this time? \nANDREW One. Here, in front of my ear. \nAn ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it before Andrew. \nBELINDA Remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away? Answering truthfully. \nAndrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible. \nANDREW By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger... \nBELINDA Answer the question, please. \nANDREW No. I can't really see it. \nBELINDA Thank you. \nAndrew rubs his eyes. \nJUDGE GARNETT (OS) (far away) This would be a good time to break for the day... \nJOE (OS) (far away) Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct? \nJUDGE GARNETT (OS) (far away) Beckett? \nAndrew finds the Judge looking at him. \nJUDGE GARNETT (CONT.) Can you go on for ten minutes? \nANDREW Yes sir. \nJoe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table. \nJOE I only need five! (to Belinda, reaching for the mirror) May I? \nJoe approaches Andrew, with the mirror. \nJOE (CONT.) Do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired? \nANDREW Yes. On my torso. \nJOE If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about. \nBELINDA We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury. \nJOE Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's see what we're talking about. \nANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE. \nJUDGE GARNETT (a moment, then) I'll allow it. Would you mind removing your shirt, Mr. Beckett? \nANGLE ON MIGUEL -- TENSE. \nANDREW Allright. \nThe COURTROOM TURNS SILENT. \nWHEELER Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job. \nAndrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR... \nWHEELER (CONT.) Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle... \nANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get the feeling she's giving her testimony). \nRACHEL I didn't mind covering for Andy, but I did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem? \nAndrew blinks... what's going on? \nLooking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler. \nEverything seems normal. \nWHEELER Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people. \nJOE What kind of people? \nWHEELER People who want to bend the rules... \nANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table: \nKILLCOYNE If you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices. \nWheeler keeps speaking: \nWHEELER ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it. \nANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON: \nKENTON You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? \nJOE Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler? You? \nANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN: \nSEIDMAN Yes, I did see the lesions. I suspected he was sick... \nCLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes. \nTHE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER: \nWHEELER The everyday, common person with decent values... \nRACHEL It seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation... \nAndrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER: \nSEIDMAN I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to... \nWHEELER ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves... \nSEIDMAN ... But we shouldn't have fired him... \nWHEELER ... It's time to get this society back on track! \nAndrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV: \nThe Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned. \nANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor. \nAndrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion. \nHe lies on the floor, looking up. \nANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him. \nANDREW Could you call an ambulance, please? \nCUT TO: \nA CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making matters worse. \nMiguel stands to the side, furious: \nMIGUEL It's making it worse. Take it out. Take it out! \nDr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes, obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide open with fear, sweat covering his face. \nCUT TO: \nPHILADELPHIA CITY HALL, A BUSINESS DAY (EXT./DAY). \nTITLE: \"Two weeks later.\" \nLESBIAN JUROR (VO) If he was \"mediocre,\" why did they gave him this major assignment three weeks before they fired him? \nPOSTAL WORKER JUROR (VO) They were testing him. \n", "test1_input": "A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a loose circle, like a casual living room. \nJoe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand. \nWheeler is looking across the room at... \nAndrew, who catches Wheeler's stare. \nWHEELER You're looking better, Andy. How do you feel? \nSILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction. \nANDREW Fine, thanks, Charles. \nJUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton. \nJUDGE GARNETT Charles, Walter... \nWHEELER Congratulations on the new grandson. \nJUDGE GARNETT Thank you. We're very happy. \nThe Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat. \nJUDGE GARNETT Attorney for the plaintiff? \nJOE Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services. \nJUDGE GARNETT I've seen your television commercials. \"If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, \"through the negligence of others.\" \nJOE I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT On behalf of the defendants? \nBELINDA CONINE Belinda Conine. Of Petersen, Lehigh, Monroe and Smith. \nJEROME GREEN And Jerome Green. \nAnd a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses: \nDEXTER SMITH Dexter Smith. \nA white-haired lawyer next to Belinda: \nRALPH PETERSEN Ralph Petersen. \nJUDGE GARNETT (to Joe) You're outnumbered four to one. (to the others) Whom do I address? I can't talk to four lawyers at once. \nBELINDA I'm chief litigator, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT Fine. I've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... There is nothing I hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. And when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. And when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages. \nJOE If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter. \nJUDGE GARNETT By God you will settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today? \nJOE Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and... \nJUDGE GARNETT Hold it, Joe. (to Wheeler) He wants to come back to work, Chuck. \nWHEELER That's impossible, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT That's impossible, Joe. \nBELINDA CONINE If it please Your Honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars. \nJOE Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago. \nJUDGE GARNETT Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut through these false attitudes. Give them a figure. How much do you want? \nANDREW I want to go back to work, Your Honor. \nJUDGE GARNETT You're here at my indulgence, young man. I'm waiting for a figure, Joe. \nAndrew and Joe confer with each other. \nJOE Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars. \nJUDGE GARNETT Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I... \nAndrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge: \nJOE One more thing, Your Honor... \nANDREW (jumping in) Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work. \nCharles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine. \nBELINDA CONINE Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit. \nANDREW I was the one who was sabotaged. \n", "test1_true": "JEROME GREEN We have letters. \nJOE Why haven't you produced these letters? \nJUDGE GARNETT Take it easy. (to Wheeler) What's the big deal, Chuck? The boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone. Why are you being hard- assed about this? \nWHEELER I wish I could exonerate you, Andy. But I'd have to lie to do it. \nANDREW (very calm) You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer. (rises) Gentlemen. (to Belinda) Counselor. \nWHEELER Don't do this, Andy. \nJOE Whoa, whoa... (to Andrew) What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz? \nKENTON A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying? \nANDREW I think I catch your subtle drift, Walter. \nAndrew saunters out. \nKENTON You'll be sorry, Beckett. \nWHEELER Andy, you don't want this. \nJoe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into a grin. He faces the Judge. \nJOE With all due respect, Your Honor, my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial. \nJoe exits. \nCUT TO: \nHAND HELD CAMERA SHOT OF: THE FRONT YARD OF A TWO-STORY Colonial house in Downington, Pennsylvania (EXT./DAY) ... \nAndrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA. \nANDREW This is the house where I grew up. In Downington, Pennsylvania. (pointing to the ground) See this... ? \nThe CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING. \nANDREW (CONT.) Those are my cute little hand prints. And my brother's and my sister's. \nMIGUEL'S VOICE (BEHIND CAMERA) And today is... ? \nANDREW Today is my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary. \nAndrew goes inside, speaking to the CAMERA: \nANDREW (CONT.) This is the front door. I caught a finger in this door, once... (holds it up) This one. Broke it. (stepping inside) This is the hallway, my mother calls it a foyer... \nINSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY): \nCHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting corsages confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into Andrew's arms. \nALEXIS Uncle Andrew! \nANDREW (to CAMERA) This is my niece, Alexis. Say hello, Alexis. \nALEXIS Mommy's pregnant again. \nANDREW (doing Walter Cronkite) You heard it here first, folks. News as it happens. \nAndrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her arms around Andrew, squeezing tight. \nJILL Hello, darlin'. \nANDREW This is my sister, Jill, the most fertile woman on the planet. She's married to Reverend Jim. \nJILL You feel thin. (over Andrew's shoulder) Hello, Miguel. \nAs Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO ANDREW, who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG. \nMIGUEL Hey, Jill. Nice to see you, sweetheart. \nJILL (hugging Miguel) Handsome devil. (referring to Andrew) Is he eating? \nMIGUEL We don't discuss his weight. (to Andrew, behind CAMERA) Do we? \nCAMERA MOVES DOWN THE CORRIDOR... \nANDREW (OS) And what will we find in... da duh da duh da duh... the KITCHEN! \nA GROUP OF LADIES SCREAM when CAMERA ENTERS KITCHEN. \nLADIES There he is! Hi, Andrew! Don't point that thing at me! etc... \nAndrew's mother Sarah wears an unpretentious flowery dress. \nANDREW Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary? \n", "test2_input": "CLOSE ON BOB SEIDMAN. \nCLOSE ON THE MARINE JUROR. \nCLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand. \nJUDGE GARNETT In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation. \nJOE With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? \nJUDGE GARNETT No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection. \nCUT TO: \nCOURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY). \nThe MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while he pees (a classic rock tune, like \"Radar Love.\") The BUSINESSMAN sighs, \"Ahhhhhh.\" \nThe RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change. \nThe ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. This does not escape the MARINE'S notice. \nROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (innocently, to Marine) I have some gay friends. What's the biggie? \nThe MARINE says nothing. \nROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.) Everybody has a couple of gay friends. Don't you? \nMARINE No, sir. I do not. \nThe MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his private parts. \nROCK MUSICIAN JUROR You might have them, and just not know they're gay. \nThe MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR. \nMARINE I know. \nCUT TO: \nWALTER KENTON ON THE WITNESS STAND (INT./DAY) ... \nJOE And how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea, without stopping at port? \nKENTON Anywhere from two weeks, to several months. \nJOE Any women on board? \nKenton glances at the MARINE JUROR. \nKENTON Not when I was in the Navy. \nJOE So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal instincts... Anything going on? \nKENTON Going on... like...? \nJOE Like... two sailors playing hide the salami. \nAndrew covers his face with his hands. \nBELINDA Objection! \nJUDGE GARNETT Mr. Miller! \nKENTON (can't resist) We had one guy like that. \nBELINDA You haven't ruled on my objection, Your Honor. \nKenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with crossed arms, waiting. \nJUDGE GARNETT Let's continue. \nJOE (to Kenton) You had one guy \"like that?\" \nKENTON Yeah. But we took care of him. \nJOE How did you do that? \nKENTON We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it. \nLAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS. \nThe JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL. \nJOE You taught him a lesson. \nKENTON Yes, we did. \nJOE Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson? \nBELINDA Objection! \n", "test2_true": "KENTON She didn't try to conceal it. \nJOE So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct? \nKENTON I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference. \nJOE But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct? \nKENTON I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own. \nCUT TO LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC: \nIN THE KITCHEN OF THEIR APARTMENT, MIGUEL POURS MEDICINE into an IV drip unit (INT./NIGHT) ... \nLOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND. \nMiguel glances at a chart on the wall, in which a day is broken into hours, with medical instructions for each hour \nMIGUEL (shouting over MUSIC) Drew! Are you ready? If we start at eight, we'll be done by twelve. \nMiguel taps the IV bag, getting the drip started. \nA cat jumps onto the counter. Miguel holds it. \nCUT TO: \nANDREW SITS AT THE DININGROOM TABLE, MAKING NOTES ON A LEGAL pad, holding out his left arm (INT./NIGHT). A catheter is imbedded into Andrew's arm, and Miguel is trying to get the IV drip started through the catheter. The MUSIC is lower... \nMIGUEL It's not going through. \nANDREW (focused on his work) We'll have to flush it again. \nAndrew reaches for a law book. \nMIGUEL Hold still. Shit. (trying again) The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter. \nANDREW I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment. \nMIGUEL We're not skipping this treatment. \nANDREW I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment. \nMIGUEL Fuck you. \nANDREW Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway. \nMIGUEL That shit's saving your life, you asshole! \nMiguel shoves away from the table. \nANDREW What's wrong with you? \nMIGUEL Close the law book. \nANDREW I'm not going to close the-- \nMIGUEL CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK! \nAndrew slams it SHUT. \nANDREW ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED! (beat) Jesus! \nMIGUEL The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time. \nANDREW (very quiet) You don't think there's much time left, do you? \nMIGUEL That's not what I said. \nANDREW You're scared. You think we're near the end. \nMIGUEL No. \nANDREW Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? \"Begin to prepare for the inevitable.\" \nMIGUEL (low) Maybe you should think about it. \nANDREW What's that mean?! \nMIGUEL (very difficult) Maybe you should think about it. \nA MOMENT. \nANDREW I'm not going to die. \nMIGUEL That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness. \nANDREW You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims? \nMIGUEL Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? \"Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel...\" Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK! \n", "test3_input": "OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO... \nELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the Famous 4th Street deli... \nJoe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room. \nDr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's room, he hears: \nDR. GILLMAN ... if he comes out of the hospital this time, you mustn't expect him to be like he was before... \nJoe steps into... \nANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ... \nA hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed: \"Victory.\" \nOPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face. \nJILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various parts of his body.) \nAndrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV. JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it. \nAs Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others. \nPeople KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room. \nON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile. \nON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look. \nAndrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants Joe to sit there. \nJoe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed. \nWith some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His voice is raspy, weak: \nANDREW What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean? \nJOE What? \nANDREW A good start. \nJoe smiles. \nANDREW (CONT.) Excellent work, Joe. I thank you. \nJOE It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. (sees the oxygen mask) Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on? \nAndrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears. \nJOE (CONT.) I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over. \nANDREW (muffled by the mask) Sure thing. \nJoe stands. \nJOE I'll see you, Beckett. \nAndrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes are dancing. \nANDREW (through mask) Thanks for coming by. \nJOE You bet. We'll see you later. \nJoe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there. \nJOE (to Miguel) He's looking good. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets out of here soon. \nMIGUEL We just want to get him home. Thanks for stopping by, Joe. \nMiguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps Miguel's back. \nJOE Night. \nJoe leaves. \nMiguel begins circulating among the \"guests,\" saying: \nMIGUEL He's tired. He ought to sleep. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nJOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES: \nJOE What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean? \nThe elevator doors close. \nCONTINUOUS CUT TO: \nANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM... \n", "test3_true": "MATT Night, Andy.

He begins to sob. \nRANDY Andy. \nAndrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected, around his brother Randy, to comfort him. \nANDREW (through mask) I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow. \nJill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room. Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door. \nMiguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes. \nMiguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV. \nAndrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say: \nANDREW I'm ready... \nMIGUEL Ready for what, baby? \nANDREW Whatever. \nMIGUEL I hope you're ready for \"Studs,\" because that's what's on. \nAndrew replaces the oxygen mask. \nThey lie next to each other, watching television. \nFADE OUT/FADE IN: \nEXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING... \nFrom inside the house: the phone rings. \nCUT TO: \nJOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ... \nLisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone. \nJoe is just waking up. \nLISA (to Joe) It's Miguel. \nJoe sits bolt upright. \nJOE Miguel? \nCUT TO: \nEXTERIOR: ANDREW AND MIGUEL'S LOFT BUILDING, DAY. \nA TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE step out. \nCUT TO: \nRACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where... \nA wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying as they hug each other. \nSomeone has set up a \"memento\" table, with pictures of Andrew at various stages of his life, and things that meant something to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his favorite cat, etc. \nTHEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the music (\"You're Miguel's parents?\" \"Do you remember when Andy...\" \"I went to college with Andy...\" etc.) \nBud Beckett sits alone, very quiet. \nMiguel leads his parents over to Bud.

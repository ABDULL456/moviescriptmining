Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..."    He doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off. 
LETTY Neater, Zach. 
Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am." 
LETTY Zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o." 
Zach looks back toward his classmates for help. 
LETTY What's wrong, Zach? 
Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect. L LETTY Try again, Zach.    Like that. 
Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes. He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him. 
Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a." 
LETTY I don't believe it.    You still can't do it. 
ZACH I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer? 
LETTY No, it's not OK. You'll never get to college on OK. 
Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides ominously down his cheek. 
LETTY It has to be good, Zach.   Do you understand me? 
Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around, unsure, confused. 
Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. 
She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a deep breath and raises her head. 
LETTY I'm very, very sorry, Zach. 
Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste. 
LETTY You know what, guys? Wednesday's not a grammar day. It's a collage day. It's a collage ON THE WALL day. 
Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. She motions for the students to join her. 
The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind. 
LETTY And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge of paste. 
INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks out the cord. L Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts that alarm off, as well. 
Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in. 
PAUL What are you doing?    You're going to be late. 
LETTY I'm calling in sick. 
Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead. 
PAUL You don't have a fever. 
LETTY I don't feel like going to work today. 
PAUL Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late? 
LETTY It'll be OK. 
PAUL But what about that math project? 
LETTY Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime? 
PAUL Forget I asked. 
LETTY I'm sorry. (beat) I'm just...I'm so tired lately. 
PAUL Maybe you ought to see a doctor. 
LETTY No, it's not like that. 
Letty starts to cry. 
LETTY It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. (MORE) 
LETTY(cont'd) And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner. 
PAUL You can get out of the dinner. 
LETTY No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come. 
PAUL Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.

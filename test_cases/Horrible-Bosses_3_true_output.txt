PELLIT What the fuck?! A guy can't get any privacy in this place! 
JACK It's all yours, Margie. 
Margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the door. 
JACK You know, Bobby, you seem to be spending more time in that bathroom than at your desk these days. 
(CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (4) 24 
PELLIT Well, then, you're fucking stupid, Dad. Because that's clearly not true. 
JACK All I ask is that you do your part around here, son. 
PELLIT I do my part. I do other people's parts. But you just like to ride my ass because I'm your son. I don't see you screaming at -- (RE: KURT) -- dickskin here. 
JACK (PATIENTLY) That's because Kurt does his work and does it well. You could take a lesson from him. 
PELLIT (SNORTS) The only thing I'd take a lesson from him on is being gay. And I wouldn't take that lesson because I don't want to be gay. 
JACK (HEADING OFF) Come on, Kurt. 
Kurt follows after Jack. 
PELLIT Yeah, that's what I thought. 
Jack and Kurt pass a receptionist desk and go out into -- 
25 EXT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 25 
Kurt walks Jack to his Cadillac. 
JACK Tell me something, Kurt. Are you happy here? 
KURT You kidding? It's the best job in the world. 
(CONTINUED) 25 CONTINUED: 25 
JACK I'm glad to hear you say that. I'm rewriting my will tonight and there's going to be a special place for you in there. 
He gives Kurt a hug like a doting father, then climbs into his car. As Jack pulls out and begins driving across the parking lot, Kurt waves. Suddenly, the car's HORN begins to honk in a CONSTANT BLARE. Kurt lowers his hand as the car veers off the pavement, slowly cruising into a tree where it stops abruptly, the horn still honking. 
A bewildered Kurt runs toward the car, as we -- 
CUT TO: 
26 INT. BRADFORD'S BAR - THAT NIGHT 26 
Kurt sits at a table looking depressed. 
KURT He died instantly. They say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon. 
PAN to reveal Kurt is sitting with Dale, who looks just as dejected. 
DALE Wow. Sorry, man. He was like a dad to you. 
KURT I loved him. And I loved working for him. And now his idiot son is gonna be in charge. You know how many times I've caught him doing blow at work? 
PAN FURTHER to reveal Nick sitting beside Dale. 
NICK That sucks. You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job. (THEN) Did I tell you Harken tricked me into having a drink at eight o'clock this morning? The guy's the devil. 
(CONTINUED) 26 CONTINUED: 26 
DALE I thought he was giving you a promotion. 
NICK He is. And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week. 
DALE Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you. 
KURT This again? 
DALE I'm telling you, she's out of control. It's a full-on hostile work environment. 
KURT She's a woman who wants to have sex with you. How bad can it be? 
DALE Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener. 
KURT Why don't you just fuck her? 
DALE I'm engaged! 
KURT Oh yeah. Congratulations, by the way. 
DALE Thank you.

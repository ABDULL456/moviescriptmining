CADEN This is the wrong key, Sandy. 
OLD PERSON #2 It isnÃ¢â¬â¢t. Caden bangs on the door. 
CADEN Adele! Adele, are you in there? 
OLD PERSON #1 Maybe itÃ¢â¬â¢s the wrong key. 
CADEN Adele? 
HAZEL Caden, there's no one in there. You've got to let go of her. She's not here anymore. I'm here.

CADEN Yeah, okay. Can we just get the right key, so we can do the scene? Please, somebody?

166 EXT. HOTEL STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 166 
Caden and Hazel walk past the set of the hotel she had stayed at with her family. 
CADEN Look familiar? 
HAZEL Oh my God! It's an exact replica of the Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on that trip! 
CADEN Listen, I built this because I wanted to show you what happened -- 
SAMMY 
(CALLING) After me, Caden, there's no one left to watch you. They look up. Sammy stands on the ledge above them. 
HAZEL SAMMY (running off) There's nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy, Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I'myour fault! 
coming up! 
CADEN No fair, Sammy! She wouldn't see you jump. She never saw me! You're not being authentic. 
SAMMY This is where we part ways. This is authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard, breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere. 
167 EXT. NYC CEMETERY - 2032 - DAY167 
Sammy is buried. An enormous crowd there: all the actors from the play, Caden and Hazel in front. Hazel weeps. Caden looks at the assembled group, from face to face.

CADEN I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due. 
168 INT. WAREHOUSE - CEMETERY SET - 2035 - DAY168 
The actor playing Sammy is in the coffin. There's an enormous crowd. Tammy plays Hazel and weeps. A stand-in for Sammy as Caden stands next to her. Caden and Hazel watch from the director's table. 
CADEN Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly. 
HAZEL Come over tonight? Please?

170 INT. BURNING HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2035 - NIGHT 170 
The smoke is thick and there are flames. Hazel, in a robe, walks around lighting candles. Caden unpacks his pumps and monitors and places them next to the bed. 
CADEN We could get a place together. We could get a loft. 
HAZEL God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us. 
CADEN Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The retarded one. 
HAZEL I'm a bad person.

CADEN HAZEL No you're not. I'm a badI am. I should never... have person.gone out with Sammy. I was just trying to get to you. 
CADEN You can't cause someone to kill himself. He was troubled. 
HAZEL I'm so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder. 
HAZEL (CONT'D) Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast. 
(CRYING) What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips. 
CADEN My heart aches so much for you. 
HAZEL We're here, Caden. I'm here. 
CADEN I'm aching for it being over.

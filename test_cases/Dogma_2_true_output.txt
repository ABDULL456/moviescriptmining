New Hosties is fortified with vitamins and minerals, topped off with an angelic kiss of frosting that stays crispy in milk! 
Christ's hands on their shoulders, the Altar Boys down their cereal happily. 
CHRIST 
Hosties is an important part of any nutritious breakfast, and each one is blessed by a high ranking Vatican Monsignor - good for the body, and good for the soul. But make sure you've confessed beforehand... 
Altar 2 clutches at his throat, gasping. 
ALTAR 2 
I... I touched... m..myself! I'm...s...sorry... 
CHRIST 
(smiling benignly) 
You're forgiven. 
Altar 2 stops choking and continues eating, happily. 
CHRIST 
So try a bowl of Hosties! And don't just take my word for it... 
A cartoon POPE pops out of the box, eating a spoonful of cereal. 
POPE 
They're Heavenly! 
INT CLICK'S OFFICE - DLSK 
A hand switches off the t.v. Pan up to Cardinal Click, all smiles. 
GLICK 
Well...? Doesn't it pop? 
Bethany. Rufus, lay and Silent Bob are at a total loss for words. 
JAY 
(After a long beat) 
Does it come in chocolate flavor? 
The Cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an overturned glass. 
GLICK 
You see? Now this one's got vision! 
(to Jay) 
We're rolling out the flavors in September. Big cereal month with the kids, back to school and all. 
BETHANY 
It's a bit... startling. 
GLICK 
Exactly! And that's what we're looking to do - shake these people up a bit, get them motivated. That's the whole point of the campaign. Mass attendance is at an all-time low in this country. And it's not like we're losing them to the Protestants or Baptists - people aren't practicing at any denomination these days. If we can sell them some show - let 'em know the Catholic church has some panache, we can win them back -even get some new ones. Fill them pews, people - that's the key. And cross-promoting - like with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook 'em while they're young. 
(sits at his desk, lights smoke) 
RUFUS 
Kind of like the tobacco industry? 
GLICK 
Oh - if only we had their numbers. But we are aiming for the same demographic, even though mine is the soulsaving biz. And if I have to play a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the Lord, then I'll wear the cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork. 
Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat rack, where the Cardinal's CASSOCK and MITER hang. Jay nudges Silent Bob. 
OC BFTHANY 
We really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day, your Emminence. My friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to talk to you about the Saint Michael's Re-Dedication ceremony. 
The Cardinal blows smoke rings. 
GLICK 
You'd like to help out in some way? 
BETHANY 
We'd like you to cancel the ceremony and the re 
dedication. 
GLICK 
(pauses mid-ash-tap) 
I beg your pardon? 
Silent Bob stands alone by the coat rack. Jay leaps into the frame, cassock tied around his shoulder like a cape. He strikes a Superman pose. 
OC BETHANY 
There's going to be a world of trouble if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward as planned. 
The Cardinal leans back in his chair. 
CLICK 
What is this - a threat? Are you planning some sort of demonstation? 
(pause) 
Are you pro-choicers? 
BETHANY 
No, the trouble's not from us. It's from these renegade angels who've been stuck on earth since the plagues... 
Rufus side-kicks Bethany, nonchalantly. 
BETHANY 
Uh... these guys who think they're renegade angels. 
RUFL'S 
See padre, it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing through the archway they can get to Heaven. Granted, it's far-fetched, but the brothers are convinced it's the truth. 
Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the partition, resembling a shark fin. It 'swims' to and fro, menacingly. Silent Bob shakes his head. 
OC GLICK 
And you want me to call off the ceremony... for that? 
Bethany leans forward in her seat. 
BETHANY 
Well. they're very passionate about it. Dangerously so. They could turn violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens. 
RUFUS 
These guys could blow, and if they do, they're going to take some people with them. Call this thing off. 
CLICK 
(beat) 
Who sent you? Someone from the Council of Churches, right? Somebody's upset that we're getting so much publicity- is that it? Who was it? Rabbi Sloss? 
RLFLS 
We were sent by Him who is called I Am. 
GLICK 
Cute. 
(standing) 
Time to go. kids. Play time with the Cardinal is over. 
RUFUS 
(to Bethany) 
Worked for Moses. 
BETHANY 
Stay out of this. 
(to Glick) 
Your Emminence, it's not a joke. These guys are an accident waiting to happen. And if the re-edication ceremony goes on as planned...

Long pause, wheels turn. Then: 
MAGUA Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can. 
Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. 
MONTCALM As the English march away, our soldiers and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort ... except for a small guard ... 
Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. 
CUT TO ... 
EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT 
walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods, waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ... 
MAGUA (in Iroquois; re: Montcalm) I wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man. He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding. 
Magua exhales in derision. 
CUT TO ... 
EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY 
at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as is - at the head - Montcalm. 
CLOSER: MUNRO 
trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. 
MONTCALM 
salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. 
CLOSER: MUNRO 
salutes Montcalm. 
MUNRO (eyes forward) Monsieur, the fort is yours. 
MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD 
marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The 33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. 
FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE 
on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column, sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 
CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN 
The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort. No Hawkeye. 
CORA 
straining to see. 
EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS 
being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior. Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... 
UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK 
on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye. Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. 
RANK AND FILE FRENCH 
A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. 
EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE 
His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... 
HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA 
riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. 
PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE 
as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He is heavily war-painted ... 
FRONTAL - MAGUA 
and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. 
MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE 
at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 
WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS 
Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. 
CLOSER: CORA

It is a typical tract house located at the end of one of the several hundred cul-de-sacs in a shopping mall district called Vista. As its name implies, the center of activity is a large modern shopping center complex. This large, child infested community holds five schools: two elementary, two junior high, and one high school. On the neatly manicured rolling hill fringes of town are a well used, man-made lake and the community's \"rec-center.\" This Chicago suburb is one of many similar communities springing up every day. Its planners' goal: to bring families and the conveniences of life closer together. \n", "test1_id": 2976, "test2_input": "Within a short period of time, the Freeling neighbors have problems of their own. Screams and panic indicate that like a contagious virus, the haunting has spread: first to the Eisenhower home, then across the street to other neighbors; then down the block. Beyond causing frightened residents to harm themselves while fleeing ghostly manifestations, ghost fires are set. (A ghost fire is a phenomenon which can take place in any room of a house. Perhaps in the cold center of the haunting in that home. The fire will devastate everything in a specific area, but will not spread to other rooms or other floors.) Each haunting, in each home, is signaled by the television. Where there is a remote control device, the TV will flip on by itself in the early hours of the morning to a station that is broadcasting static noise. The manifestations originate there. \nOther items for possible incorporation would be: \n", "test2_true": "Occasionally there is a manifestation of a whisp-like type of smoke in basic humanoid form that keeps changing shape and travels from one room to the next, until if finds the recipient is has been looking for. When found, the smoke will dissipate into the sleeping person. We will see their hair blow from their ear, as if a ghostly breath is whispering something privately, and chillingly. We might even hear mournful crying of \"help me, help me\" from perhaps a poltergeist. Beyond the toaster and the microwave oven, the ectoplasmic manifestations will finally develop first and foremost from the television sets that are on during static hours, as if a form is trying to climb out of the TV set and into your home to haunt you. This could be the climax of the story. \n", "test2_id": 2977, "test3_input": "August 7, 1980 \nNora is feeling very uneasy and tired from little sleep during the night. Steven has headed off for work and the children, except for Carol Ann, are all off to school. Jim and Joannie Bender live next door and are really the only close neighborhood friends the Freelings have. When the housing tract was announced, they were the first two families on the list after camping out in line for almost a week. A feat Nora now tends to regret. She telephones Joannie and asks if she'd like to come by for a morning cup of coffee. Joannie indicates that it's a pretty busy time for her, but before she finishes, Nora cuts in, edging on hysteria, almost begging. A little alarmed, Joannie quickly agrees and the Freeling doorbell is ringing within minutes. Nora, straining to be relaxed, gives her a big hug and talking a mile-a-minute heads for the kitchen with Joannie in tow. Certain things in the house are still disheveled from all the activity during the night. Joannie takes notice of this as she follows Nora to the kitchen. A concerned look crosses her face as she knows Nora is a meticulous house keeper. Nora hands Joannie a cup of coffee, and blurts out, almost in tears, \"Joannie, could Steve and the kids stay with you and Jim tonight?\" Joannie immediately assumes that Nora and Steven are separating, hence the frantic call. Nora immediately straightens that out but still avoids any discussion about ghosts. She reveals that they believe there have been burglars in the area and they're all feeling a bit uncomfortable staying there knowing they haven't been caught. Without hesitation from Joannie, everything is arranged. Steven arrives home after picking up the kids and finds Nora and Carol Ann patiently waiting in the living room with bags packed. She then announces she has made arrangements with Joannie and Jim for the family to spend the night at their house. Steven gets slightly irritated, feelinng that Nora is over reacting but quickly agrees to have dinner, but not necessarily spend the night. All the kids are delighted because the Bender children are close in age and they look forward to one big party. \n", "test3_true": "The laughter from the children stops instantly and we visibly see two of the children shudder and slowly turn and look in the direction Angel is staring. The fire wavers slightly as if there was a breeze. Then from upstairs in the bedroom the 19th Century music album can be heard full blast as Angel screams and throws her arms back outstretched and fighting as if being tired to a stake. Her face contorts in agony. She throws her head back and forth violently. All the children in the living room are stunned and just stare, mesmerized. Angel cries out several times, \"No more fire! No more fire!\" The violent jerking subsides for a moment as her eyes rise, still a horrific look on her face, her hair slowly rises as if someone has hold of it and is going to scalp her. Again she screams violently and her head drops limply in front of her. Her arms are still outstretched but she's become more resolved to the pain now, almost unconscious. We are aware that is has become a freezing temperature inside the room, frost has gathered on the windows even though it is the middle of July outside. We then become aware of very faint imprints of faces in the windows. Then writing starts to appear on the filmy condensation, like finger painting. All the screaming has brought Steven and Jim into the living room. Steven enters with an angry tone, \"What the Hell...\" his voice trails off as he sees Sweeny huddled in the middle of the floor rocking Angel, trying to comfort and calm her. The other children, with teeth chattering, still stare as if in shock. Steven and Jim's arrival breaks the silence. Carol Ann jumps up and runs hysterically to her father. Steven scoops her into his arms at the same time that one of the Bender children becomes aware of the faces in the windows, she screams, which sets off a chain of reaction screaming. Then as quickly as it happened, it ends. The blaring music stops, the frost runs off the windows. All the children are obviously shook. Joannie and Nora run in with a flurry of questions. None of which has an audible answer from the children. Nora looks at Steven, they realize the ghosts have followed them. Everyone has gathered with the kids in the kitchen to have warm milk and cookies to calm everyone's nerves. Angel is back to normal with little sign of her ordeal. All the kids decide they'll sleep in the living room except for the two youngest. Nora and Joannie are in fair agreement to this as they head up the stairs with the little ones. The other kids get the sleeping bags out and start rearranging the furniture for space. Lawrence Freeling is really impressed with the Bender's new Advent TV screen. Johnny Bender runs through the remote control with him and they loudly discuss how great the football games can be seen and they can't wait for the season to start. Soon things settle down, the kids are set and the grown-ups head upstairs. Half way up, Nora says \"Ok, everyone quiet, it's way past bed time, lights out, no talking and no watching television.\" After the \"good-nights\" and the periodic giggling subsides, the room gets very quiet except for the usual night time creaks. About 30 minutes go by and we hear Lawrence, \"psst...Johnny, are you awake?\" There's a moaning sound, then \"yeah...what'd ya want?\" (Lawrence) \"What time is it?\" Johnny looks over at the big Grandfather clock on the far wall. \"It's 2:00 in the morning. Why are you still awake?\" Lawrence ignores the question and says \"How do you turn on the TV...and make sure there's no sound.\" (Johnny) whispering, \"You're nuts, go to sleep, there's nothing on at this hour.\" (Lawrence) \"Wanna bet? We've got to get it just as it signs off.\" (Johnny) \"You mean to tell me you like to sit and watch the snow or something?\" (Lawrence) \"Something like that, you'll see.\" Reluctantly Johnny craws out of his sleeping bag and over to the set; flips it on just in time to see the jets go by on the sign off. (Lawrence), \"Great, perfect timing.\" (Johnny) \"Don't you think there's been enough weird shit tonight?\" (Lawrence) \"Oh come on be a sport, just watch.\" The two boys crawl back into their sleeping bags and with their chins resting on folded arms, they stare in great anticipation at the Advent screen and the mass of static snow. Shortly we see both of the boys drift off to sleep trying as hard as they can to fight staying awake with no luck. Just as they drift off, the images that began to appear in the Freeling home begin to slowly take shape at the Benders. It's 3:00 am, the Grandfather clock chimes on deaf ears. \n", "test3_id": 2978}

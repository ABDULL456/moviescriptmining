{"train": "NIGHT TIME \n[The \"POLTERGEIST\" Treatment] \nMarch 31, 1980 \nSteven Freeling is a successful husband, father and provider. His innate practicality and above average intelligence have made him a successful real estate salesman for a large agency in a nearby community. He is well liked, and respected by his boss and co-workers, and is considered an upstanding member of his community. \nThe children, Sweeny, age 16, Angel, age 14, Lawrence, age 12, and Carol Ann, age 6, are children of the 80's. They watch more TV than they should, see all the \"PG\" movies at the local six-plex, and do just enough homework to get by in school. They participate in a \"healthy\" amount of sibling teasing and fighting, with subjects ranging from which TV show should be aired to who stole who's toys. They are gregarious children who all have \"best friends,\" \"2nd best friends,\" \"3rd best friends\"....... \nCarol Ann is typically precocious for a child with much older brothers and sisters. \nTAGINA BARRINS is a 65 year old medium. She has studied under some of the well known psychics of the times and is a regular contributor to the National Enquirer; this being the only accepting outlet for her communications with \"the other side.\" She is eccentric in her manner of dress and speech, but is sincere in her beliefs and very probably a true psychic. \nWhy must all tales of ghosts and hauntings find their settings in gothic cobwebbed mansions, miles away from civilization? Where does an audience draw the line between what is real and what is fantastic? \nIt is a quiet evening. The children have gone to bed allowing Nora and Steven their cherished hours alone. They go to their bedroom, turn the TV on to THE TONIGHT SHOW, (Something they do almost every night) and prepare for a well deserved evening of rest and relaxation. They are lulled to sleep by the voices on the television set. The rest of the evening's programming, the late-late movie, the broadcast of the local news, the sign-off consisting of the Blue Angels performing to strains of the Star Spangled Banner, color bars and test patterns, the local sign off....and finally, static, or white noise. It is through this blizzard of static snow, and beyond the slumbered breathing of Nora and Steven, that the first flash of paranormal communication occurs. The television moans something chillingly audible and the static non-picture rearranges into something indistinguishable. Steven turns over in his sleep, but does not awaken. The days that follow bring a stream of odd but not necessarily suspicious occurrences. Periodic phantom phone calls break the silence in the middle of the night. On the other end, nothing but static noise; similar to the static of the blank night television. \nFood disappears from the cupboards and refrigerator, and a special lemon meringue pie is marred by nibbling fingers. But with children in the house, and the children's friends, the blame is not easily fixed. The furniture, slightly at first, is rearranged. Just enough to annoy a meticulous mother; not enough to cause suspicion. Elmer, the family dog, begins wandering to a certain alcove in the house. He then sits there, facing the wall, occasionally whimpering toward it, reaching out his paw and scratching at the air. But, well, he's getting old, and if people can get senile, so can dogs. \nThe Freelings are bird lovers. They have built a beautiful aviary which has become the home of many different kinds, colors and sizes of birds. The aviary is located on a patio that is attached to the house. Steven and Nora awaken one early morning to find birds flying all over the house. At first, angry at the children for not closing the cage, Steve wakes them and takes them all downstairs for a lecture on closing and locking the bird cage. But upon entering the porch, everyone is silenced by something: the sight of the aviary torn open, a feat accomplished by something beyond human strength. But no noise had awakened them...\"what is going on?\" \nWindows and doors open and close, seemingly by themselves. In the middle of the night someone has to go downstairs to re-bolt a window or re-lock a door. Furniture is being moved around more obviously now. \nSteve and Nora prepare to leave for a dinner with their friends. They have called a babysitter because the older children are going to a movie. As Steven is shaving, the 19th Century Music album is turned on full volume. This startles him and causes him to cut himself. He storms out of the bedroom, goes to the stereo, takes off the album and breaks it. He then yells for Angel and reprimands her for turning it on so loud. She hasn't done it. The other children deny it also. Steven accuses one of them of lying. \"Record players don't just turn themselves on, you know.\" \nAngel, upset with her father for breaking her album, and for accusing her unjustly, goes to her room upset. She has to prepare for her date. \nAs she puts the children to bed, they talk her into telling them a story. She concedes, and tells them a ghost story. As she tells her story, actual events in the house upstage the fictional story she is telling them, adding to and punctuating the higher points. Terrified, the babysitter, negligent of her duties, runs screaming from the house into the night. Neighbors' lights go on, obviously disturbed by the screaming. \nThe older children get home to find the little ones sitting together on the steps, no babysitter in sight. The parents return to a story of a deserting babysitter who says their house is haunted. The evening's events have everyone on edge, especially Steven and Nora. Nora sits at her vanity brushing out her long auburn tresses. As she brushes her hair somewhat mindlessly past her right shoulder, an invisible wind lifts her hair out from her brush and her hand. It arches her hair slowly over her head and lays it to rest on her left shoulder. She sits frozen, unable to speak, the empty brush in her hand, her wide eyes locked on her image in the mirror. At that moment, she feels something touching her cheek. We see two indentations, such as fingers would make, as her cheek gently caves in, opening her lips, and her face is tilted upward by an invisible hand. She then receives a \"ghost kiss,\" a long, forced, passionate kiss, from which she cannot free herself. As she is released, there is a noise from the living /dining area. Steven bolts from their bathroom, sees the wide-eyed, almost panicked, expression on his wife's face. He grabs her hand, and together they walk down the hall to check the house. The furniture in the dining room has been totally rearranged. The chairs are on top of the furniture. Some of the furniture has been moved from room to room. They wake the children, pack lightly, pick up the dog and leave to spend the night at the local Holiday Inn. They will stay there for the evening, then move into Nora's sister's house within a day or so. \nThis discovery, along with the disclosure of the events at the Freeling household, cause experts to hypothesize that perhaps through a rift in the barrier between \"now\" and \"then,\" and through one of the members of the Freeling family, as a mortal host, the spirits have found a gateway into the 1980's and American suburbia. Some hypothesize that they are looking for help to the next world, the world that they belong in, and the world that has been denied them. \nThe Freelings are instantly descended upon by professional, pseudo-professional and crack-pot ghost hunters who all want to spend an evening in the house with the ghosts and their new-fangled equipment for recording spirits on film and tape. A psychologist informs the family that perhaps the spirits are attracted to one member of the family, and that a battery of tests could be run to determine who it was. Not wanting to place any kind of \"blame\" or ostracization upon any member of the family , they refuse the testing. Besides, what would they do with the \"guilty\" party? As the Freelings and their house become unwitting celebrities, the children are saddled with a barrage of torment from schoolmates. They are avoided. They are \"the haunted people.\" \nAnother aspect of the dog's being affected by the Haunting, could be for the family to see it roll over on its back, as if it is being tickled on the tummy; and without anything obviously petting it, he wags his right leg, the common reaction of most dogs when being tickled above the abdomen. \nOne possible ending for NIGHT TIME could be the evacuation of the town by the townspeople. As we slowly pan through the empty town and its deserted homes, we see ghost fires being lit. The town burns, TV sets imploding; the burial ground has not been consecrated, and the souls are set to rest in peace. \nA policeman arrives approximately 8pm. He asks Steven and his family questions about recent threats, etc. And then falls into a serious discussion about the Freelings moving from the neighborhood all together. At least consider a temporary move. Growing hostility has been evident through periodic vandalism. Several windows over the last week with broken windows in their house and automobile along with other assorted mischief. Steven loses his temper at one point during their conversation and questions whether the local police department has really made a concerted effort to do anything to protect his family let alone control this mounting violence. As the conversation heightens almost to hysteria, an iron comes hurling through the living room plate glass window followed by the loud chanting of an angry mob outside, \"Free us from the Freelings.\" Steven grabs the police man and screams, \"What are you going to do about that?\" pointing hysterically out the window. Flustered, the policeman frees himself from Steven's grasp and takes control by ordering Nora and the children into the living room on the floor out of the way of the windows. Things settle for a bit and the policeman and Steven move toward the front door. He reaches over to pull it open, gun drawn, he jumps back just as a frying pan flies by catching the corner of the door jamb. Out of sight, but with the door still ajar, the policeman yells orders for the crowd to disperse. Footsteps and scurrying can now be heard on the roof, Nora attempting to calm the children. Lightheartedly (on the surface), she heads to the kitchen to get the children some milk and cookies. It's obvious the crowd, laden with guns, frying pans, kitchen knives, crow bars, etc., are paying little attention to the policeman's demands. He reaches over to shut the door, the chanting continues, several octaves higher now. As the door slams, he yells to Steven to get on the phone for some backup units. As he says this, a huge gush of water pours out of the fireplace, sending a cloud of ashes and soot into the living room. The children jump up running and screaming. Nora, in the kitchen, sends a glass pitcher crashing to the floor, she screams and runs to the living room. Steven, angry and frightened, grabs the phone to call for reinforcements but the phone lines have been cut and the phone is dead. Nora and the children begin bolting the doors and windows frantically. The chanting outside continues. The youngest of the Freelings, Carol Ann, silently sobs in the corner of the couch holding snugly to a white stuffed bunny rabbit. In the midst of the terror, she suddenly stands and makes her way toward the window, a very content look on her face as she gazes outside at the angry faces. Her bunny drops and dangles from her hand as she slowly looks toward the sky. Slowly at first, then like locusts, real rocks begin descending from the sky, pummeling the mob. People begin screaming and running in all directions. Slowly various members of the family stop what they're doing and move toward the living room window. Within a few minutes, the yard is cleared of people and rocks cover what was a lawn. The family, relieved but uncomfortable, stare silently at Carol Ann, who softly giggles and caresses her bunny-off in a world of her own. \nIT'S NIGHT TIME story by Steven Spielberg. Amendments-August 18, 1980 August 8, 1980 \nAugust 8, 1980 \nCarol Anne and her best friend, Jeanette are playing house upstairs in Carol Ann's bedroom. They have dressed up in various old clothes of Nora's and some of her jewerly and hats. Tea has been served though a minature little tea set which Carol Ann has obviously used often with all the chips and cracks, etc. Both girls are talking a mile a minute to their dolls. Although this is make believe, like any little girls six years old, they're playing very seriously. \nToward the end of the picture, we should reveal that Carol Ann is beginning to \"get to\" Nora. Nora has already felt trapped over the past few years. She married at a very young age. She's bright and enthusiastic and has begun to voice her discontent to Steven. It's obvious that Carol Ann was not a planned baby as noted by the ages of the other children. \nNIGHT-NORA'S BEDROOM \n[the next page is missing] \nSweeny has fallen asleep in the rocking chair next to the bed. A thoughtful look crosses her [Nora's]face as she grabs her robe and heads for the door. A huge back-hoe can be seen past the gentleman at the door. \"We've come to start diggin' the pool area, ma'am.\" Nora, with a slight look of embarrassment, \"Oh, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot it was Saturday-I\"ll show you around to the back yard.\" The door closes. As she comes back in, the rest of the family has come to life, the record player is already full blast up stairs, Carol Ann transfixed herself in front of Saturday morning cartoons. Nora exits the kitchen, where Angel has already started breakfast. \"Hi mom, I didn't know they were going to start digging the swimming pool today?\" Nora, \"I totally forgot. I even forgot what day it was. God, I wish your father would come home.\" Angel, \"I can't wait for a pool.\" She can tell that Nora isn't really listening, her head buried in the refrigerator. Angle (while turning the bacon), \"Mom, what happened last night? I heard screaming. Sweeny said you'd had a nightmare. It must have been terrible. Do you remember any of it?\" As she is saying this with her head still buried in the refrigerator, Carol Ann wanders in, bunny in tow, and slides unnoticed under Nora's arm to peer in the refrigerator. Nora goes to close the refrigerator, catches a glimpse of Carol Ann and lets out a blood-curdling scream. Carol Ann, obviously frightened, drops to the floor and bursts into tears. Angel at this point also screams and sends the spatula and bacon grease flying everywhere. Nora, more embarrassed than anything, bends down to comfort Carol Ann, she looks up at Angel. A big grin spreads across her face and they burst into hysterics. Nora:\" I guess I'm still a little shook from last night.\" \nNora driving in a transfixed stare, headlights lighting her face from ongoing cars. We see that her hair is caked with mud along with her arms and face. She pulls into a Motel 6 about 30 miles outside of town, checks in, and immediately goes to call Steven. There's no answer. She dials again, still no answer. She looks at her watch, it's 11pm. Frustrated, she grabs her bag and heads across the street to a little local dive cafe called Indian Palms. She fumbles around with the menu. Nothing looks very good, the page flips back revealing a historical overview of Indian history in the area with a map and pictures from the early 1800's. Nora barely pays attention to what she's looking at until she sees a small picture of a ghastly massacre, an artist's conception of the actual event. She continues reading and realizes that the massacre took place at the exact location of their sub-division. She stuffs the menu in her purse and peels out of the parking area back toward town. We cut to the children at the house. All the younger children have dosed off, Sweeny lies wide awake cocking his head at every sound. Finally he gets up and walks into the kitchen. He opens the refrigerator and the light from inside spills onto the floor in front of him. The storm front seems to be moving on and the pounding rain has turned into a howling wind. He reaches in to grab some milk just as the wind gusts through the back door, then slams it shut causing Sweeny to jump and drop the cartoon of milk. Sweeny moves toward the back door, tries the light switch, nothing happens. He slowly opens the door, \"Elmer, hey boy...where are you?\" He then sees pool lights, or rather an eerie glow emanating from the freshly dug hole in the back yard. As he steps out onto the patio, cautiously moving toward the illuminated pit, he gets within a few feet and a skeletal head emerges slowly over the edge. Horrified, Sweeny loses his balance and falls backward into the mud along the edge. He quickly scrambles to his feet, sliding across the patio and into the house, never looks back. He then slams the door shut and locks it. He runs to the living room. He sees Carol Ann sitting up, her back to him. All we hear is a humming lullaby. He moves around to the front of her. She doesn't look at him, only stares out the window, singing to her bunny, \"It's night time, it's night time...\"Still panicked, he wakes the other two kids, \"C'mon we gotta go!\" He looks at Carol Ann, hesitant at first, \"You too, let's go.\" He reaches out to grab her hand. She looks at him sternly and says, \"No.\" Sweeny stares for just an instant and then reaches over to pick her up. Angel steps in and says,\"Here Carol Ann, I'll hold your bunny.\" Carol Ann turns to both of them and in a low rumbling male voice says, \"NO,\" then pulls the head off her bunny, stuffing flying everywhere. From Carol Ann's POV looking at the shocked faces of Sweeny and Angel, we see a ghost fire burst into flames in the neighbor's house and Jim and Joannie Bender come running out into the street. Then headlights come through the living room window playing across the wall and over to Carol Ann's face. Sweeny, Angel, and Lawrence turn to run toward the door and it too bursts into flame, just as we hear Steven's voice from outside the door,\"Sweeny, are you in there?\" Sweeny terrified, \"Dad, we've got to get out of here. She'll burn the place down.\" His voice trails off as we hear a chair come crashing through the picture window. Quickly Steve helps all the kids outside. He yells for Carol Ann, Sweeny grabs his arm, \"No!\" he screams. \"She should stay.\" Steven looks at Sweeny dumbfounded. Just then, Nora drives up and comes running to the four of them. Steven starts to go in after Carol Anne, Sweeny practically tackles him, \"No Dad, please.\" Nora rushes over, \"Oh God, believe him he's right...\"she buries her head in his chest. We look up and see Carol Ann get up and walk slowly, still humming, toward the back door and out into the yard, moving toward the pit. Steven and Nora grab the kids and head for the car. We then realize that ghost fires have started throughout the neighborhood, even in those houses that have not yet completed construction. People are running with few belongings to their cars, some screams and crying can be heard. \nCUT TO: \nThese final revisions to the treatment, dated August 23, 1980, change the \"white settlers killed by Indians\" buried under the neighborhood to simply a regular grave yard that Steven's company decided to build on top of. It also amps up the danger to Nora in the scene where she is attacked by the ghost in her bedroom before running outside and falling into the newly dug pool. Finally, it adds an early scene showing the changing of the TV set channels by unseen forces (and also renames \"Lawrence\" to \"Robbie\"). \nAugust 23, 1980 \nFairly deep in thought, Nora combs through her hair in long slow strokes. Then without warning, the brush lifts her hair from one side of her head and lays it down on the other. Nora stares in a state of shock. Indentations from fingers can then be seen as if a hand is grabbing her face and turning. Nora is still in a state of shock, unable to move. We then see her lips press in, her nose shift off to the side a bit and we realize she is being kissed by a ghost. The indentations leave her face and she sits shocked for a few minutes. Then in the mirror, she sees a human form take shape from a smoke and gaseous material. Nora slowly rises from her chair and begins to move toward the door. Staring at the smoke-like shape which is now dissipating, she reaches up to turn on the bedroom light. Just as she switches it on, it immediately goes off. Quickly she turns it on again and again something switches it off. She gasps a little and turns to run down the hall and the stairs to the living room turning lights on as she goes but they go off as quickly as she turns them on. She then turns on the television set which immediately goes off. She runs for the phone, which is invisibly taken out of her hand and hung up. Truly frightened, she runs upstairs again, half way up the stairs as if someone stepped on the back of her dress, she falls. We then see a hand print as if something were gripping her ankle and it begins moving up her leg. Nora stares for a moment in horror and then begins to resist, trying to pull herself up the stairs, reaching desperately for the banister. As she breaks free she runs into the bedroom, the door slams shut moments later and the smokey, gaseous form begins to appear again. We can only see it with the moonlight streaming through the window. Nora sits shivering on the corner of the bed with her hands crossed over her chest holding onto her shoulders. We're then aware of the hand indentations again which grab her wrists and slowly but forcefully uncross her arms and drop them to her side. Nora, under her breath, on the verge of tears says, \"No, no please don't hurt me...\" As she says this, her night gown is slowly ripped off her shoulders and she is pushed down on the bed. We then see the hand indentations grasp her breast with a strong massaging effect and move down to her underwear which is gradually slipped back on the bed. Not able to grab at any human form she takes hold of the sheets for leverage to try and get out of the ghost's grasp. In the struggle she rolls off the bed, but we're aware that she still can't get up. Her arms are suddenly thrown back straight over the top of her head and then her legs are pulled apart forcefully, we can see on Nora's face sheer terror beyond the ability to cry. Then the sheet over the top of them begins to rise up and down rhythmically, and several times we see her face being kissed. Then the sheet falls away from her as if someone rolled over and took the sheet with them. Nora, for an instant, stares at the sheet, then jumps up and runs for the door grabbing her robe on the way out. She gets downstairs, grabs her purse and heads for the front door. She takes hold of the handle and finds that she can't turn it. She pulls frantically to no avail. She then runs for the back door, quickly switches on the outside light and runs out on the patio. Finding it difficult to see, she runs into the patio table, and knocks a chair over just as the outside light goes off. Now, truly horrified she starts backing out onto the lawn. A clap of thunder goes off startling her, she turns and steps right into the freshly dug pit for the new swimming pool. Another clap of thunder, a bolt of lightning and a huge downpour starts. The freshly tilled soil turns into a gooey quick sand like mud very quickly. One end of the pool is very steep and as Nora tries desperately to climb out the grade is so steep she slides back each time. After the second or third slide, the mud is now up around her waist, another clap of thunder and suddenly the pool lights come on. Nora looks around for a moment and suddenly we see areas in the mud that start to rise up and then shafts of mud as the pouring rain hits these, we realize they are skeletons, more and more bobbing to the surface, then again a bolt of lightening strikes and short circuits the pool lights, causing a strobe effect. In sheer terror, eyes shut, Nora begins screaming, clawing frantically trying to make her way to the shallow end of the pool. Just as she nears the edge a hand reaches out to help her. With one hand resting on the pools edge and the other in this hand, she looks up into the eyes of her ghost, a smoke like apparition. For the first time, we can make out a human like face. Nora screams and goes sliding down back into the sea of skeletons only to come face to face with the corpse of the ghost she just saw. The last image we see is Nora huddled in the corner of the pool, strobe lights going and a sea of bobbing skeletons, rain pouring down and occasional lightening and thunder. \nAnother revision page dated August 23, 1980 \n", "test1_input": "The next morning at breakfast, things are a bit strained. A normal breakfast conversation is changed into a frightening experience when the six-year-old, Carol Ann, is talking about what she is going to do at school when all of a sudden, for no more than three or four words, her voice changes, slips two octaves, and a man's voice continues telling the story in the child's own words, but only for a few seconds before the young girl's voice returns. The whole family stops eating, and stares. It is obvious that the child is not aware of what has just occurred. Nora gets up. Puts her hand over her mouth, stares at Steven with a realization of the night before, and runs back up to their room. \nThey come to grips with the fact that it might not be the house, but themselves that are \"haunted.\" The desire for familiar surroundings, and the realization that no one's been hurt, causes them to go back home. \n", "test1_true": "Also taking place at this time is a major archeological dig. This is going on not from from the Freeling's home (Perhaps instead of a dig, it should be just the building of some new homes in a tract, nearby). The excavators discover bones. Human bones. Thousands of them. It is discovered that what has been unearthed is an extremely large grave site. The results of a massive massacre of white settlers, perhaps 150 years ago. The bones had been shoveled into shallow graves in approximately a 100 acre perimeter. Children, babies, pioneer men and their women. Arrow heads, scalping knives-a horrible way to die. \n", "test1_id": 2976, "test2_input": "Within a short period of time, the Freeling neighbors have problems of their own. Screams and panic indicate that like a contagious virus, the haunting has spread: first to the Eisenhower home, then across the street to other neighbors; then down the block. Beyond causing frightened residents to harm themselves while fleeing ghostly manifestations, ghost fires are set. (A ghost fire is a phenomenon which can take place in any room of a house. Perhaps in the cold center of the haunting in that home. The fire will devastate everything in a specific area, but will not spread to other rooms or other floors.) Each haunting, in each home, is signaled by the television. Where there is a remote control device, the TV will flip on by itself in the early hours of the morning to a station that is broadcasting static noise. The manifestations originate there. \nOther items for possible incorporation would be: \n", "test2_true": "Occasionally there is a manifestation of a whisp-like type of smoke in basic humanoid form that keeps changing shape and travels from one room to the next, until if finds the recipient is has been looking for. When found, the smoke will dissipate into the sleeping person. We will see their hair blow from their ear, as if a ghostly breath is whispering something privately, and chillingly. We might even hear mournful crying of \"help me, help me\" from perhaps a poltergeist. Beyond the toaster and the microwave oven, the ectoplasmic manifestations will finally develop first and foremost from the television sets that are on during static hours, as if a form is trying to climb out of the TV set and into your home to haunt you. This could be the climax of the story. \n", "test2_id": 2977, "test3_input": "August 7, 1980 \nNora is feeling very uneasy and tired from little sleep during the night. Steven has headed off for work and the children, except for Carol Ann, are all off to school. Jim and Joannie Bender live next door and are really the only close neighborhood friends the Freelings have. When the housing tract was announced, they were the first two families on the list after camping out in line for almost a week. A feat Nora now tends to regret. She telephones Joannie and asks if she'd like to come by for a morning cup of coffee. Joannie indicates that it's a pretty busy time for her, but before she finishes, Nora cuts in, edging on hysteria, almost begging. A little alarmed, Joannie quickly agrees and the Freeling doorbell is ringing within minutes. Nora, straining to be relaxed, gives her a big hug and talking a mile-a-minute heads for the kitchen with Joannie in tow. Certain things in the house are still disheveled from all the activity during the night. Joannie takes notice of this as she follows Nora to the kitchen. A concerned look crosses her face as she knows Nora is a meticulous house keeper. Nora hands Joannie a cup of coffee, and blurts out, almost in tears, \"Joannie, could Steve and the kids stay with you and Jim tonight?\" Joannie immediately assumes that Nora and Steven are separating, hence the frantic call. Nora immediately straightens that out but still avoids any discussion about ghosts. She reveals that they believe there have been burglars in the area and they're all feeling a bit uncomfortable staying there knowing they haven't been caught. Without hesitation from Joannie, everything is arranged. Steven arrives home after picking up the kids and finds Nora and Carol Ann patiently waiting in the living room with bags packed. She then announces she has made arrangements with Joannie and Jim for the family to spend the night at their house. Steven gets slightly irritated, feelinng that Nora is over reacting but quickly agrees to have dinner, but not necessarily spend the night. All the kids are delighted because the Bender children are close in age and they look forward to one big party. \n", "test3_true": "The laughter from the children stops instantly and we visibly see two of the children shudder and slowly turn and look in the direction Angel is staring. The fire wavers slightly as if there was a breeze. Then from upstairs in the bedroom the 19th Century music album can be heard full blast as Angel screams and throws her arms back outstretched and fighting as if being tired to a stake. Her face contorts in agony. She throws her head back and forth violently. All the children in the living room are stunned and just stare, mesmerized. Angel cries out several times, \"No more fire! No more fire!\" The violent jerking subsides for a moment as her eyes rise, still a horrific look on her face, her hair slowly rises as if someone has hold of it and is going to scalp her. Again she screams violently and her head drops limply in front of her. Her arms are still outstretched but she's become more resolved to the pain now, almost unconscious. We are aware that is has become a freezing temperature inside the room, frost has gathered on the windows even though it is the middle of July outside. We then become aware of very faint imprints of faces in the windows. Then writing starts to appear on the filmy condensation, like finger painting. All the screaming has brought Steven and Jim into the living room. Steven enters with an angry tone, \"What the Hell...\" his voice trails off as he sees Sweeny huddled in the middle of the floor rocking Angel, trying to comfort and calm her. The other children, with teeth chattering, still stare as if in shock. Steven and Jim's arrival breaks the silence. Carol Ann jumps up and runs hysterically to her father. Steven scoops her into his arms at the same time that one of the Bender children becomes aware of the faces in the windows, she screams, which sets off a chain of reaction screaming. Then as quickly as it happened, it ends. The blaring music stops, the frost runs off the windows. All the children are obviously shook. Joannie and Nora run in with a flurry of questions. None of which has an audible answer from the children. Nora looks at Steven, they realize the ghosts have followed them. Everyone has gathered with the kids in the kitchen to have warm milk and cookies to calm everyone's nerves. Angel is back to normal with little sign of her ordeal. All the kids decide they'll sleep in the living room except for the two youngest. Nora and Joannie are in fair agreement to this as they head up the stairs with the little ones. The other kids get the sleeping bags out and start rearranging the furniture for space. Lawrence Freeling is really impressed with the Bender's new Advent TV screen. Johnny Bender runs through the remote control with him and they loudly discuss how great the football games can be seen and they can't wait for the season to start. Soon things settle down, the kids are set and the grown-ups head upstairs. Half way up, Nora says \"Ok, everyone quiet, it's way past bed time, lights out, no talking and no watching television.\" After the \"good-nights\" and the periodic giggling subsides, the room gets very quiet except for the usual night time creaks. About 30 minutes go by and we hear Lawrence, \"psst...Johnny, are you awake?\" There's a moaning sound, then \"yeah...what'd ya want?\" (Lawrence) \"What time is it?\" Johnny looks over at the big Grandfather clock on the far wall. \"It's 2:00 in the morning. Why are you still awake?\" Lawrence ignores the question and says \"How do you turn on the TV...and make sure there's no sound.\" (Johnny) whispering, \"You're nuts, go to sleep, there's nothing on at this hour.\" (Lawrence) \"Wanna bet? We've got to get it just as it signs off.\" (Johnny) \"You mean to tell me you like to sit and watch the snow or something?\" (Lawrence) \"Something like that, you'll see.\" Reluctantly Johnny craws out of his sleeping bag and over to the set; flips it on just in time to see the jets go by on the sign off. (Lawrence), \"Great, perfect timing.\" (Johnny) \"Don't you think there's been enough weird shit tonight?\" (Lawrence) \"Oh come on be a sport, just watch.\" The two boys crawl back into their sleeping bags and with their chins resting on folded arms, they stare in great anticipation at the Advent screen and the mass of static snow. Shortly we see both of the boys drift off to sleep trying as hard as they can to fight staying awake with no luck.

CARSON (VO) (thru radio) Not yet... 
Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer... 
CLOSER 
Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen. 
DAVE 
fumbles to scroll back to the check. 
DAVE (into radio) Wait! One of Javal's alias accounts: check for an apartment rental! 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) You're shittin'... Where?! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - ANGLE ON WINDOW - DAY 
Through the sheer curtains over the window we can SEE the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs. 
DAVE (VO) Park La Brea! 
We PULL BACK... they're way up in a high-rise building... The CAMERA continues to PULL BACK, farther and farther... 
...REVEALING 4,222 apartment units, on 168 acres. The building in which the apartment is located is one of 18 identical, 13- story towers standing side-by-side in a series of hexagons. 
EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY 
Vreeland's Apache helicopter LIFTS OFF. 
INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Miranda looks at Carson, then checks her watch. 4:52. 
CARSON (into radio) ...Have the Manager evacuate the complex. Find out which unit the family's in, but don't let anyone go in 'til we get there. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Dave, re-energized, is juggling the phone and the radio. 
DAVE (into radio) Private security's going around with PA's, and they set off the fire alarm. (into phone) Well, try callin' him again! (into radio) Manager's gone, and the Assistant can't find the key to get to the rental manifest. (into phone) Then kick the fuckin' door down! 
INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY 
The dense Assistant Manager, MILTON, stands in the outer office, staring at the inner office's closed door. 
MILTON (into phone) I'll try him in his car again... 
During this, outside: 
WESTEC GUARDS (OS) (thru car-mounted PA) Tenants -- leave your apartments at once... Take the stairs... 
INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at Miranda. 
CARSON "Fuck-you" pumps?? 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS) ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful. 
JOY They must know we're here... 
ALL Help! 
No answer. 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY 
Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on the complex from all directions. 
Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it: 
VOICE THRU PA Han family. Show us your location... 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS). 
Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter. 
JOY Mother... Sam... 
They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han understands... She hesitates, then: 
MRS. HAN Do it. 
Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's sitting closest to the window. 
With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter, sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains. 
INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY 
Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door to the inner office and rush in.

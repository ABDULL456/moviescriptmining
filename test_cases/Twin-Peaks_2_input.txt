71.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - DAY 
Laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed.  She goes to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls one out and lights it. 
She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk.  Opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine.  Like a pro she takes out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort.  Then another.  Big sigh of relief. 
Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out.  Pages are missing.  First, she discovers one, then more. 
Laura panics.  Dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and taking her private diary, she sprints from the room. 
72.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, ENTRANCE WAY - DAY 
Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom, SARAH PALMER, coming home with a load of groceries.  A cigarette in her mouth. 
SARAH Laura, honey... (smoke going into her tearing eyes) Cigarette...  Cigarette... 
Laura takes it out of her mouth. 
LAURA Can I take the car? 
SARAH Sure honey, what's the hurry? 
LAURA I forgot my books at school. 
Laura runs from the house. 
SARAH Laura. 
LAURA What? 
Laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her. Laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette. Sarah sternly takes the cigarette from Laura's hand.  As they make the exchange. 
SARAH You'll never be a smoker if you don't 
SARAH (continued) start.  I mean it. 
Takes a drag.  With barely a nod, Laura is gone.

74.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laura skids up outside the apartment.  Then backs the car up to a darker, more enclosed area amongst some trees.  Cautiously, she gets out of the car and then hurries to Harold's door. 
AT THE DOOR 
Laura frantically knocks at the door.  HAROLD SMITH answers. 
HAROLD Laura? 
75.     INT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laura rushes past him to the sofa, opening the book for him to see. 
LAURA My secret diary.  There are pages missing. 
HAROLD Who would do that? 
LAURA Bob. 
HAROLD But Bob isn't real. 
LAURA The pages are gone.  That's real. 
HAROLD Maybe. 
LAURA Bob is real.  He's been "having" me since I was 12. 
Stunned, Harold doesn't know what to do. 
LAURA (continued) The diary was hidden too well.  He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now.  He's real He speaks to me. 
HAROLD What does Bob say? 
LAURA (whisper) He wants to be me...  or he will kill me. 
HAROLD No...  No... 
LAURA (strangely) Oh, yes...  yes... 
Laura starts towards him frightening Harold. 
HAROLD What?  Please. 
She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with a horrifying expression on hers. 
LAURA FIRE WALK WITH ME. 
She buries herself on his shoulder. 
LAURA (whispers) The trees...  the trees... 
They break. 
LAURA (continued) You have to hide the diary, Harold.  You made me write it all down.  He doesn't know about you.  You'll be safe. 
She stares at Harold.  Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion. 
LAURA You're not Bob are you, Harold?  If you are, you can kill me right now.  Kill me right now, if you are. 
HAROLD Laura, no, I'm not.  I'm not Bob. (begins to shake and cry) Poor Laura.  I wish I could help you. 
He holds her.

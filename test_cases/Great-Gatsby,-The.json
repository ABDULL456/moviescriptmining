{"train": "THE GREAT GATSBY \nWritten by \nBaz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce \nBased on \nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald \nA BLACK SCREEN. \nThe blackness is pierced by a single, pulsing green light... \nWe drift, as if by boat, across a dark bay toward the light. \nThen, we hear a troubled voice. \nNICK (V.O.) In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: \"always try to see the best in people,\" he would say... \nA gentle snow begins to fall, obscuring the light... \nNICK (V.O.) As a consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements. \nThe snow grows heavier. \nNICK (V.O.) But even I... have a limit. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY \nContinue drifting, through the snow, across an icy lake... \nNICK (V.O.) Back then all of us drank too much. \nDISCOVER: A stately Victorian building... \nNICK (V.O.) The more in tune with the times we were, the more we drank. \nCLOSE ON: The sign, \"The Perkins Sanitarium.\" \nNICK (V.O.) And none of us contributed anything new. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY \nDISCOVER: A man shrouded in darkness. He leans against an old fireplace, hand covering his face. \nNICK When I came back from New York I was disgusted. \nREVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic. \nNICK (CONT'D) Disgusted... with everyone, and everything... Only one man was exempt from my disgust. \nREVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR. \nDOCTOR One man...? Mr. Carraway? \nNICK (WHISPERS) Gatsby... \nDOCTOR Was he a friend of yours? \nNICK He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him... \nNick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering. \nNICK (CONT'D) A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away... \nDOCTOR Where did you meet him? \nNick stops and stares out the window, haunted. \nNICK At a party. In New York. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nTHROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky. \nNICK (V.O.) In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria... \nON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling... \nNICL (V.O.) Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall Street boomed, in a steady golden roar... \nIMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK'S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...! \nNICK (V.O.) The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper. \nFADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street. \nNICK (V.O.) Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious. \nPUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up. \nNICK (V.O.) And I was one of them. \nREVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LONG ISLAND - WEST EGG - DAY \nBRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. \nFOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house. \nNICK (V.O.) Her husband was heir to one of America's wealthiest families. \nBRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! \nTom whacks the polo ball... \nNICK (V.O.) His name was Tom Buchanan. \nThe ball nearly hits one of Tom's gardeners... \nNICK (V.O.) When we were at Yale together he'd been a sporting star. \nBRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! \nTom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... \nNICK (V.O.) But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs. \nTom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. \nTOM (INTO PHONE) I thought I told you not to call me here...! \nPULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. \nClunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength. \nTOM (CONT'D) Shakespeare! How's the great American novel coming...? \nNICK Oh, I'm selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase's outfit-- \nTOM Never heard of em. \nTom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness! \nTOM (CONT'D) Hey! What say after dinner we go into town? \nNICK CAN'T-- \nTOM Catch up with the old wolf pack? \nNICK Big day on the new job tomorrow-- \nTOM Nonsense! We're going. \nINT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON \nTom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom's infinite sporting achievements. \nTOM First team, all-American! \nTom admires his own achievements. \nTOM (CONT'D) You see? Made me who I am today. \nTom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet-- \nTOM (CONT'D) Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! \nTom exchanges the trophy for a football. \nTOM (CONT'D) Life's something you dominate Nick. \nHe pelts Nick with the ball-- \nTOM (CONT'D) If you're any good. \nNick fumbles as Tom charges him-- \nTOM (CONT'D) Ha-ha-ha! \nTom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... \nINT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON \nA shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... \nCLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. \nWe hear the giggle of naughty children... \nBOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... \nDAISY (O.S.) Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely? \nSuddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. \nCLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... \nNICK (V.O.) Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... \nShe whispers dramatically... \nDAISY Do they miss me in Chicago? \nNICK Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love. \nDAISY (UNIMPRESSED) How gorgeous. \nNICK They're absolutely in mourning... They're crying... \nDAISY NO-- \nINT. WILSON'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nAs Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. \nTOM Hello Wilson! How's business? \nWILSON (UNCONVINCING) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? \nTOM I've got my man working on it. \nWILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? \nTOM (COLDLY) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? \nWILSON I don't mean that, I just... \nWilson's grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. \nMYRTLE If its business you're talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... \nMyrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. \nMYRTLE (CONT'D) (WITHOUT TURNING) Hurry up! \nWILSON Oh, sure... Sure... \nWilson hurries out back. \nTOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. \nMYRTLE A pleasure... \nTOM Nick's a writer... \nMyrtle is completely uninterested. \nNICK (FEEBLE) I'm in bonds, actually... \nTOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. \nMYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin' that dog? \nTOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She'll like him... \nNICK Oh no, that's alright, I'm busy... \nMYRTLE Catherine's said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. \nNICK Really I can't... \nTOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That's rude. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe muffled sounds of sex... \nCLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. \nNick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. \nNick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. \nShe sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. \nCATHERINE I'm Catherine; ain't we havin' a party? \nNICK Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a good time-- I was just going-- \nBut Nick's exit is blocked. \nMRS. MCKEE Hello...! \nMRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. \nMR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. \nNICK Nick Carraway. \nMRS. MCKEE Where're the kids? \nNick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... \nCATHERINE What's the matter? Don't ya like me? \nSUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. \nMRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! \nMYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! \nTom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. \nTOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. \nMyrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. \nNICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... \nTOM (grabbing Nick's arm) Nonsense... \nNICK Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my-- \nTom pulls Nick back toward the party. \nSUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose! \nCLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! \nPULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY \nNick's been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... \nNICK I have no clue how I got home. \nEXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING \nNick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. \nCLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. \nHe realizes he's been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. \nNICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... \nHis pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... \nA sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... \nNICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. \nINT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY \nThe Doctor leans forward. \nDOCTOR (SLIGHTLY INCREDULOUS) Watching you...? \nNICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... \nDOCTOR And how do you know that? \nNICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. \nFADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick's doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... \nNICK(CONT'D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby's... \nThe words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: \"Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TWILIGHT \nA line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby's gates. \nNICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... \nAs an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby's gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... \nNICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby's... \nCRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby's magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT \nDressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. \nNICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby's door... \nA gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS \nA bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT \nChampagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. \nNick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby's... \nNICK (V.O) A caravansary of... \nIMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... \nNICK (V.O.) Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby's beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) \nNICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! \nOverwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... \nNICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? \nHe brandishes his invitation. \nNICK (CONT'D) I live just next door... \nBARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I've never seen him sir. Why, no one has... \nThe bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. \nNICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. \nHe downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT \nTEDDY (CONT'D) I'm stealing her away Carraway! \nOver wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... \nORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's \"A Jazz History of the World\", and accompanying fireworks! \nNick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- \nTEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don't marry poor boys-- \nOn cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... \nNick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... \nMAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? \nNICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. \nCUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. \nMAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? \nNICK (VERY TIPSY) The whole thing's incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now CRUMPLED INVITATION) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby, no one's met him; they say he's third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! \nAt the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter's tray and hands it to Nick... \nMAN I'm afraid I'm not a very good host, old sport... I'm Gatsby. \nCLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. \nNICK (MUTTERING APOLOGIES) Oh.. I'm very sorry-- I... I've had so much to drink... \nThe delirious opening chords of Tostoff's \"History\" coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! \nGATSBY (APOLOGETICALLY) I thought you knew, old sport. \nGatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. \nNICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. \nAll at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. \nHERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. \nGatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. \nGATSBY I'm trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? \nNick shakes himself from his reverie. \nNICK What time? \nGATSBY Any time that suits you. \nGatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. \nHe kisses her lightly on the hand. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) (TO NICK) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. \nAs Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. \nNICK I expected him to be... \nJORDAN Old and fat? \nNICK Well, yes; young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. \nJORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... \nNICK Why not? \nJORDAN I don't know... I just don't believe he went there... \nJordan is interrupted by a voice. \nHERZOG I beg your pardon... \nShe and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. \nHERZOG (CONT'D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. \nJORDAN (SURPRISED) Me? \nHERZOG Yes, madame. \nAs Vladimir Tostoff's erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... \nNick, unsettled, watches her go... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER \nAlarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... \nSeeing Nick, she rushes to him... \nJORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... \nTeddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. \nTEDDY Where have you been!? The car's waiting! \nWOLFSHEIM (CONT'D) Finest specimen of human molars... \nBefore Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. \nGATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? \nNICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people's wives... \nGATSBY (taking his seat) Other people's wives? Ah... I see. \nGatsby looks to Wolfsheim. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Other people's wives... Meyer? \nWolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... \nWOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I'll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... \nWolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... \nGATSBY You'll have to excuse him... In his old age, he's prone to \"digress...\" He's a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... \nNICK Who is he anyhow? \nGATSBY Meyer? He's a gambler. \nOver Nick and Gatsby's shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... \nNICK An actor? \nGATSBY Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. \nNICK Fixed it? \nGATSBY Fixed it. \nNICK How did he manage that? \nGATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... \nBefore Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. \nTOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where've you been!? Daisy's furious you haven't called up. \nNick and Gatsby stand. \nNICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. \nCLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. \nGATSBY I'm so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. \nTom turns back to Nick. \nTOM I wouldn't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. \nNICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- \nNick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. \nPUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK \nJordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. \nDISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... \nNICK I'm looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I've spotted her. \nNick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. \nNICK (CONT'D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? \nAn immaculate MAITRE'D offers Nick a chair. \nMAITRE'D Will the gentleman be joining? \nNICK (FRUSTRATED) One moment please-- \nJORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. \nAs Nick's frustration and Jordan's embarrassment grow-- \nNICK It's all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- \nJORDAN If you'll just have a seat-- \nNICK What is this big request!? \nJORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. \nNICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? \nNick sits... \nNICK (CONT'D) Why? \nJORDAN Well... I don't know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY \nBut before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: \"The truth is...\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON \nDaisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. \nJORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o'clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nJordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. \nJORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) \nJORDAN (CONT'D) I'd never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (MUSES CYNICALLY) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... \nAs Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he's struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. \nNICK It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? Gatsby's house being just across the bay... \nJordan whirls round-- \nJORDAN It's no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. \nNick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. \nNICK All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (TO HIMSELF) The modesty of it. \nJORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it? \nA cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... \nINT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS \nJordan slides in... \nTAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? \nJORDAN Long Island, please. \nNICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? \nJORDAN (a stern whisper) She's absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can \"happen to drop by.\" \nCLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... \nNICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? \nAs Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nNick's taxi pulls past Gatsby's mansion, ablaze with light. \nNICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn't a sound. \nEXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nAs Nick's taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. \nNICK Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island! \nGATSBY (TERRIBLY ANXIOUS) Ah, does it? I've... I've just been glancing into some rooms... Let's go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- \nNICK It's too late tonight. \nGATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer... \nNICK I must go to bed... \nGatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. \nNICK (CONT'D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. \nGATSBY Oh, that's alright. I don't want to put you to any trouble... \nNICK What day would suit you? \nGATSBY What day would suit you...? I don't want to put you to any trouble... \nNICK Day after tomorrow alright? \nGATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I'd... I'd want to get the grass cut. \nThey both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick's ragged lawn ends and Gatsby's manicured one begins. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) There's another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? \nNICK Not really. \nGATSBY If you'll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I'm saying right? You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport? \nNICK Trying to. \nGATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. \nNICK I've got my hands full. \nGatsby's face falls. \nDAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (GRAVE MURMUR) His name is Ferdie. \nINT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY \nDaisy continues ahead into the living room. \nNick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy's reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... \nDAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can't believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? \nINT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDAISY (TO HERSELF) He is in love with me... \nNick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy's merely been admiring the flower display... \nNICK That's funny. \nDAISY What's funny? \nKNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. \nNICK One moment... \nINT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS \nNick opens the door. \nGatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. \nNICK What are you doing? \nWithout a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... \nINT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDaisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... \nThe reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy's, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. \nDAISY I'm certainly glad to see you again. \nGatsby's face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. \nFinally, he finds words... \nGATSBY I'm... certainly glad to see you as well. \nTheir hearts pound - the tension excruciating. \nEEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the TENSION-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. \nThe rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. \nGATSBY We've met before... \nSUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby's elbow... \nAnd falls! And breaks! \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Ah... sorry... \nHe clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! \nNICK (IDIOTICALLY) It's an old... clock. \nDAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. \nGatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. \nGatsby takes a seat. \nA long silent beat. \nDAISY (CONT'D) We haven't met for many years. \nGATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. \nThe precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. \nNICK (ABRUPTLY) Tea? \nGATSBY (DYING) Thank you old sport. \nDAISY (ALSO MORTIFIED) Darling thank you. \nNick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. \nA long, terrible silence... \nSuddenly Nick stands. \nNICK I just need to... pop into town. \nGATSBY (HORRIFIED) Town...? \nNICK The village; I'll be right back. \nAs Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGatsby stands at his window, staring into the night. \nNICK (V.O.) But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy's part in it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SANITARIUM - NICK'S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK \nNick is writing at his desk... \nNICK (V.O.) It wasn't until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... \nINT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - END OF WINTER - DUSK \nNick stops his reading, and, very slowly, admits... \nNICK You see doctor... Gatsby's real name was... James Gatz. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nI/E. NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY \nPUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust. \nNICK (V.O.) His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... \nDISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... \nNICK (V.O.) But he never accepted them as his parents at all. \nYoung Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... \nNICK (V.O.) In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God... \nCLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA. \nNICK (V.O.) Destined for future glory... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NORTH DAKOTA - PRAIRIE - NIGHT \nThe silhouette of TEENAGE GATZ, now 16 years old, disappears into the hills... \nNICK (V.O.)

LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON \nCLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might. \nNICK (V.O.) One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril... \nYoung Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay. \nNICK He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... \nThe bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht's railing. \nCODY Whadzamatta...? \nCody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently. \nYOUNG GATSBY Sir! The shoal here's real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... \nCody waves a dismissive arm... \nCODY Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport? \nHe collapses, dead drunk. \nPUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... \nNICK (V.O.) This was his opportunity, and he seized it. \nSpringing into action, he clambers onto the yacht. \nGATSBY (VOICE) I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CODY'S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON \nYoung Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him. \nNICK (V.O.) He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CODY'S YACHT - DAY \nA perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing. \nNICK (V.O.)

GATSBY'S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT \nTom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... \nDAISY (TO NICK) These things excite me so... \nGatsby turns to Tom... \nGATSBY I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. \nTOM That's right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... \nGATSBY That's right. See... I know your wife. \nTOM Is that so? \nGATSBY Yes. \nAs the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. \nHERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... \nHerzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. \nGatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... \nGATSBY Not now. \nHerzog silently recedes... \nA romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... \nTRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! \nGatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... \nGATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? \nTom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. \nTOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. \nAs Daisy takes Gatsby's arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom's breast pocket and murmurs... \nDAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... \nAs Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. \nPUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nAs Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. \nDAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? \nGATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... \nDAISY It's perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT \nTom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. \nTOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? \nHe notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... \nTOM (CONT'D) (TO NICK) I'll find you... \nHe leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... \nEXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT \nDaisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... \nGatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. \nThen, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... \nGatsby turns, and Daisy's lips suddenly find his. \nA long, still kiss... \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT \nNick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. \nWhen Tom suddenly appears... \nTOM Have you seen my wife...? \nStartled, Nick turns... \nNICK (LIES) Ah... no... Not for awhile. \nTOM That's funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. \nTom follows Nick's gaze down toward the tree... \nTOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... \nDAISY'S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. \nTOM (O.C.) (CONT'D) I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I'll make a point of finding out. \nAs the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby's \"guards.\" \nCLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby's gate, GATSBY'S COAT OF ARMS READS: \"Ad Finem Fidelis\" (\"Faithful to the End\"). \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT \nIt is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... \nNick descends the stairs, drunk. \nNICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... \nGatsby is not amused. \nGATSBY She didn't like it. \nNICK Of course she did. \nGATSBY No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand. \nNICK You mean about the party? \nGATSBY The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see... (SHOCKING INTENSITY) (MORE) \nGATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. \nNICK What...? \nGATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we'll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. \nNICK I wouldn't ask too much of her... \nGATSBY Ask too much? \nNICK No. \nGatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. \nGATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- \nNICK Jay... You can't repeat the past. \nGatsby wheels around... \nGATSBY Can't repeat the past? \nNICK No. \nGATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then... \nGatsby looks out to the green light. \nNICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... \nGATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. \nNICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... \nIN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY'S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nI/E. DAISY'S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nPUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping... \nNICK (V.O.) Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident. \nAmidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd. \nGATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I'd never been in such a beautiful house before... \nDaisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... \nAt the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer's uniform. \nNICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. \nDaisy's Mother stops her on the steps. \nDAISY MOM Daisy, don't scamper. (WHISPERS) There's so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family's... \nCLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... \nGATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. \nAgainst his better judgement he follows Daisy up... \nINT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT \nChecking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is not far behind... A secret rendezvous. \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT \nGATSBY I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her... \nINT.

GATSBY'S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK \nAt the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... \nCLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers... \nDAISY I don't want to go home. \nGatsby hold her tighter. \nGATSBY Then don't. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nLong shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... \nWIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. \nWe hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... \nGATSBY (O.S.) I've been meaning to call you up. I'm sorry, I've been... so busy. \nNICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nAn unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... \nGATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. \nNICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? \nGATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (CLARIFIES) They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. \nHerzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... \nGATSBY (CONT'D) What's the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? \nINT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nNick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nGatsby whispers into the phone... \nGATSBY (EXCITED) Nick... Daisy's ready. Shes ready. But there's just one thing. She's requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (AN ADMISSION) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? \nINT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nPUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY \nWIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. \nTOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... \nBlue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... \nTOM (CONT'D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... \nTom stands and strolls to the open French window... \nTOM (CONT'D) The sun is getting colder every year... \nDaisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. \nCLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. \nThe tension is excruciating. \nOut the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. \nTOM (CONT'D) How I'd like to be out on that bay today. \nCLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. \nGATSBY I'm right across from you. (POINTS) Right there. \nTOM (UNIMPRESSED) So you are. \nGatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. \nGATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. \nTOM What light? \nGatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy's... \nJORDAN (O.C.) (MOCKING) We're almost out of gas Tom... \nEXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY \nSCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson's... \nWilson doesn't budge. He's staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. \nTOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let's have some gas... (GETS OUT) Do I have to do it myself? \nWILSON I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. \nTOM Your wife does...? \nTom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle's face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... \nNICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... \nWILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin' whether she wants to or not. \nTom isn't listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! \nTOM What do I owe you!? \nWILSON Dollar twenty. \nThe blue coup\u00e9 flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. \nTOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! \nHe throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coup\u00e9! \nI/E. GATSBY'S CAR/TOM'S COUP\u00c9 - DAY \nVRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. \nAs Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... \nPAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... \nSLAM CUT TO: \nINT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY \nCRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... \nTOM That's enough... \nThe room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. \nDAISY Open another window. \nNICK There aren't any more. \nDAISY Then telephone for an axe... \nTOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. \nGATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? \nTOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? \nGATSBY What is? \nTom turns to Gatsby... \nTOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? \nDAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. \nGatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. \nTOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. \nGATSBY No, not exactly. \nTOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. \nGATSBY Yes - I went there. \nTom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. \nTOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! \nDAISY Tom...! \nGatsby stands. \nGATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. \nTOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. \nGATSBY You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. \nTom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. \nNick can't help but smile. \nNICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. \nDAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... \nBut Tom's not done yet. \nGATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. \nTOM Nonsense. \nDAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. \nTOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! \nTom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. \nTOM (CONT'D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim's bunch. \nTom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. \nTOM (CONT'D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! \nGATSBY What about it, old sport? \nTOM Don't call me `old sport!' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. \nGATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it. \nTOM I've been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? \nGATSBY It's called `greed,' old sport. \nTOM That's right; you've got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (TO NICK) I'm surprised he hasn't tried to drag you in... \nNick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. \nTOM (CONT'D) My God, he has... \nGATSBY He's got nothing to do with-- \nTOM With your little racket... (TO DAISY) Daisy... Can't you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he's just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! \nGATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!! \nTom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. \nTOM Oh no, no, we're different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and JORDAN) They are... (now at Daisy) SHE IS; (MORE) \nTOM (CONT'D) we're all different from you - we were born different, it's in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! \nGatsby explodes with terrifying rage. \nGATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! \nShock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... \nNICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had \"killed a man.\" \nTom snorts a dismissive laugh. \nTOM That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... \nGatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. \nDAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. \nStruggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. \nGATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy. \nDaisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. \nGATSBY   (CONT'D) We're going back   to Louisville to be married. Then   we're going to live together in   our house; it's-- \nThere is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. \nCLOSE ON: Nick. \nNICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... \nDAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! \nDaisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. \nTOM You two start on home... (TO GATSBY) In Mr. Gatsby's car. \nDaisy is alarmed now. \nTOM (CONT'D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. \nDaisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. \nGATSBY Daisy...! \nDaisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. \nTOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? \nNICK What? \nTOM Want any? \nNICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I'm thirty. \nTom mutters as he pours himself a drink... \nTOM Happy birthday... \nNick is staring out the window, lost in thought... \nNICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... \nCUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. \nPUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. \nThe Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. \nMICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. \nSome of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... \nWILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! \nTom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. \nTOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... \nWilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: \nINT. WILSON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nTom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. \nTOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coup\u00e9. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. \nThe policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. \nPOLICEMAN What color's your car? \nTOM Blue, a coup\u00e9; we've come straight from New York. \nMICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... \nThe policeman accepts, suspicious still... \nPOLICEMAN Alright... Blue. \nIn the relative calm of the office, Wilson's clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. \nWILSON Who owns the yella' car...? \nTOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he's a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... \nWILSON Maybe he was the one foolin' with Myrtle; maybe that's why he killed her...? \nTOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... \nWilson starts sobbing again. \nWILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! \nHe rests his head on Tom's shoulder... \nTom consoles Wilson and then whispers... \nTOM Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He'll pay... Oh, he'll pay... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TOM'S COUP\u00c9 - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs... \nTOM The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... \nJordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing... \nTOM (CONT'D) You gonna defend him now, huh? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT \nThe coupe drifts slowly up the drive. \nEXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT \nAs they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. \nTOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... \nTom opens the door. \nNICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. \nTom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. \nTOM What is the matter with you? \nTom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick's arm. \nJORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? \nNICK No... thanks. \nJORDAN It's only half past nine... \nNICK No. I think I've had enough... Of everyone. \nCLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... \nBut Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... \nEXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT \nAs Nick's feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... \nExhausted, Gatsby turns... \nGATSBY Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? \nCLOSE ON: Nick. \nNICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... \nNICK Jay... You oughtta go away. \nHe helps Gatsby cover the car. \nNICK (CONT'D) Tonight. They'll trace your car. \nGATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight. \nNICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? \nNick follows him from the garage toward the house. \nGATSBY Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together. \nNICK But Jay she-- \nSensing Nick's tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. \nGATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She'll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. \nNICK JAY-- \nGATSBY She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning. \nGatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... \nHe turns to go in but stops. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Wait up with me? The suns almost up... \nNICK (V.O.) That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT \nGatsby's voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast, lonely mansion as he confesses... \nGATSBY You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty. (MORE) \nGATSBY (CONT'D) I suppose that's why I make things up about myself... But I`ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- \nAs Gatbsy continues, Nick's V.O. FADES UP: \nNICK (V.O.) He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he'd joined Wolfsheim in the business... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN \nIn the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. \nNICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby's... extraordinary gift for hope. \nGATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. \nNICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... \nGATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. \nNICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. \nGATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... \nFinally, Nick is able to ask: \nNICK What was in the letter? \nGatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... \nGATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return-- \nIn the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: \"Daisy, the truth is... I'm penniless.\" \nGATSBY (O.C.) (CONT'D) I asked her to wait until I'd made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. \nThe IMAGE of Daisy fades... \nGATSBY (CONT'D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. \nNICK (V.O.) It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A hand takes a revolver from a desk drawer... \nIt is Wilson. \nFLOAT: Toward the window behind him... \nWE SEE the staring eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. \nWILSON God sees everything. \nEXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - MORNING \nLooking up from the bottom of the pool we see a crowd of staring faces and the pop of flashbulbs through water... \nNICK (V.O.) ...of police and photographers and tabloid reporters.

Just you, me, and daddy... \nBRRIIING!!! \nTom appears beside Daisy. \nTOM (TENDERLY) We should go. \nBRRIIING!!! Finally, at the top of the stairs, Henri answers. \nHENRI Buchanan residence. \nINT.

They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness... \nHe looks to the throng of press swarming like vultures around Gatsby's casket.

Don't talk. I want to hear what happens. \nA subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. \nNICK Is something happening? \nJORDAN I thought everybody knew. \nNICK I don't. \nJORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. \nNICK Got some woman? \nJORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time...

Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: \nDAISY Oh Nicky... \nNICK What? \nDAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. You know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I've had very bad time Nicky... I'm pretty cyncical about everything. \nDaisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. \nNick tries to change the subject-- \nNICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? \nDAISY Pammy? Oh yes... \nDaisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. \nDAISY (CONT'D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.' \nShe breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... \nDAISY (CONT'D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... \nAnd as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby's castle... \nDAISY (CONT'D) And they don't come back. \nEXT.

Write. \nNICK Why would I do that? \nDOCTOR After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time. \nNICK Yeah, well. It didn't bring anyone else much solace... I wasn't any good. \nThe Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept. \nDOCTOR No one need ever read it. You can always burn it. \nNICK What would I write about? \nDOCTOR Anything.

The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... \nEXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY \nHIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance. \nNICK (V.O.) New York's dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... \nIMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here. \nNICK (V.O.) ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. \nA train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. \nDISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... \nNICK (V.O.) ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T.

He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! \nCLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. \nGATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance.

Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. \nSLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick's lap. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Here! That's the one from Montenegro. \nIt looks authentic. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Turn it. \nNICK (READS) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. \nGATSBY That's right. \nSLAP! A photograph joins the medal. \nGATSBY (CONT'D) Here's another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. \nCLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. \nNICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? \nDING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... \nGATSBY (O.S.) But don't take my word for it. At lunch, I'm going to introduce you to one of New York's most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I've told you, and vouch for my good character... \nI/E.

You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today. \nNICK A big request? \nGATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. \nNICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What's she got to do with it? \nGATSBY Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright... \nRRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. \nCOP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! \nGATSBY (CALMLY) All right, old sport! Alright. \nWithout slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... \nCOP (EMBARRASSED) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! \nThe cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! \nNICK One of your old Oxford pals? \nGATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (ADDS PROUDLY) I imagine he'll be at lunch too... \nNICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... \nNick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. \nAn orchestral melody surges... \nNICK (V.O.) I didn't know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... \nAs the orchestra builds, Gatsby's car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... \nSUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... \nNICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... \nBAAAAM!

How is the bond business Mr. Carraway? \nNICK It's fine, thank you. \nWOLFSHEIM I understand you're looking for a BUSINESS GONNEGTION-- \nGATSBY No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. \nWOLFSHEIM Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man. \nWoldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... \nGatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up. \nGATSBY Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? \nGatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone. \nWOLFSHEIM Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford? \nNICK I've heard of it... \nWOLFSHEIM Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted.

Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. \nNick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. \nHe holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... \nNICK Who's this?

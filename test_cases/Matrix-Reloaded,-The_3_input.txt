MORPHEUS 
"Were deep in their territory." 
NEO 
"I see that." 
MORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO. 
MORPHEUS 
"Are you rested?" 
NEO 
"Yes." 
MORPHEUS 
"You know now, that you had predecessors." 
NEO 
"Yes. Ive heard things." 
MORPHEUS 
"What types of things?" 
NEO 
"That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be special. But they ended up dead." 
MORPHEUS nods slowly. 
MORPHEUS 
"Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away. Because you were not ready." 
NEO nods. 
MORPHEUS 
"Does this anger you?" 
NEO 
"I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be." 
MORPHEUS 
"You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy. Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing." 
NEO 
"What?" 
MORPHEUS 
"The destruction of The Matrix." 
MORPHEUS looks out into the darkness. 
MORPHEUS 
"Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one knows." 
NEO 
"Can we ask The Oracle." 
MORPHEUS 
"Not in this life." 
NEO is confused. 
MORPHEUS 
"No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher turned on us." 
NEO is taken aback. 
NEO 
"But she must have known, if they came to her." 
MORPHEUS 
"Perhaps she did." 
NEO shakes his head. 
NEO 
"I cant believe it. I dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this war. Im not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?"

BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish. \nINT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM \nMOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans. \nINT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM \nMOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm. \nAlthough asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself: \nVOICE (V.O.) ... Yes. \nParrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. \nHe rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes up: \nVOICE (V.O.) Yes... \nIt is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild- ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. \nHe pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his eyes. \nVOICE (V.O.) Yes. \nParrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep. \nEXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING \nThe great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. \nA Painter approaches. \nPAINTER The big tent, Miss Allison -- \nALLISON Paint is rust and moss green. Medieval colors -- Daddy's like an old knight. \nA Florist stops her. \nFLORIST The head table --? \nALLISON What about it? \nFLORIST The flowers, ma'am--? \nALLISON Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy loves freesia -- and you, over there, lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking for a saffron glow -- sort of tea- dance twenties. \nEXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING \nParrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ- ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish passes. \nPARRISH What do you think of all this, May? \nMAY It's going to be beautiful.  And Miss Allison says the President may come. \nPARRISH Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party. \nMAY (smiling) What? \nParrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace. \nALLISON Daddy! \nPARRISH Hi, Allison -- \nALLISON Have you got a minute? \nPARRISH Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind? \nALLISON Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept... \nPARRISH Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing. \nALLISON But it's your birthday. \nParrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee. \nSUSAN Good morning, Dad. \nPARRISH Hi, honey. \nALLISON (to Susan) I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. \nSUSAN (smiling) Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. \nPARRISH Drew's aboard? \nSUSAN He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours -- \nBut Parrish only pours coffee. \nSUSAN (cont'd) (to Allison) You coming? \nALLISON You've got patients waiting, I've got three hysterical chefs, one loves truffles, the other hates truffles, the third one doesn't know what truffles are.  I'd better drive down. \nParrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity. \nPARRISH (unconsciously) I hate parties -- \nALLISON Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it. \nPARRISH Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it. \nALLISON No. \nAllison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting. \nSUSAN I agree -- \nYOUNG MAN Why? \nSUSAN I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why? \nYOUNG MAN I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him. \nSUSAN So you're a one-girl guy? \nYOUNG MAN Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her. \nSusan laughs. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) Well, don't laugh.  I just arrived in town, got a new job -- I'm trying to get into this apartment.  You a doctor? \nSUSAN How'd you know? \nYOUNG MAN Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor? \nSUSAN Me?  Internal medicine. \nThe Young Man smiles. \nYOUNG MAN So if I needed a doctor, you could be it? \nSUSAN I could be her. \nYOUNG MAN 'Her'. \nA moment. \nSUSAN Yes, I could. (a moment) I have an office in the hospital. \nYOUNG MAN -- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well. \nSusan looks into her coffee. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) I'm sorry, you mind my saying that? \nSUSAN Not at all. \nYOUNG MAN How 'bout another cup of coffee? \nSUSAN I've got patients coming in -- \nYOUNG MAN And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee? \nTwo pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and refills her cup and his.  Pushes a container and pitcher to- wards her. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) I see you use lots of sugar and cream.  Me, too... \nThey smile at each other, fix up their coffee. \nEXT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nA magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum. \nINT. OUTER LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY \nParrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware- ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him. \nDREW I'm all excited -- \nPARRISH Me, too. \nDREW I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- (faltering) Instead it was -- \nPARRISH Like a marriage made in heaven? \nDREW You have a way with words. \nThey stride to the main bank of elevators. \nINT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY \nParrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished desks.  Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man- ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods despite his swift entrance. \nHe passes through an open set of doors and he is into his own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant. \nJENIFER Good morning, Mr. Parrish. \nPARRISH Hi, Jennifer. \nDrew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited. \nDREW So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right? \nPARRISH As close as a deal could be. \nDREW (bursting) Olympic. \nParrish disappears into his office.  Drew, on his way out, glides past Jennifer's desk. \nDREW (cont'd) This is our lucky day. \nJennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk. \nINT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY \nAlone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately changes.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the Manhattan skyline: cogitates. \nHe takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it. \nParrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands, trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some- thing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard: \nVOICE (V.O.) Yes. \nFrozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself: \nVOICE (V.O., cont'd) ...Yes. \nParrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is possessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi- trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously, enrage, responds to the Voice. \nSUSAN No, it was so right it scares me. \nYOUNG MAN I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me. \nSUSAN Why? \nYOUNG MAN Because I like you so much. (a moment) You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor? \nAnother moment. \nSUSAN Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. (a moment) ...And I don't want to examine you. \nYOUNG MAN Why not? \nSUSAN Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go. \nShe hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching her.  Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction. \nANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN \nShe looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on. \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN \nHe looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens, now he turns and walks on. \nON SUSAN \nShe looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed in the opposite direction, his back to her.  She turns the corner and continues on. \nON THE YOUNG MAN \nApproaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again, but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane, HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as his body arcs through the air. \nAnother sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies crumpled, still. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT \nA beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line.  The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and Quince.  COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass hors d'oeuvres and drinks. \nALLISON ...Music, I know how you love music, Daddy, and I want to have music that pleases you -- and of course doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep -- I've agonized over this and finally settled on Sidney Brown, twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini Lopez-zy, I forget their names -- \nParrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with him. \nALLISON (cont'd) You haven't heard a word, have you? I keep talking and all you do is nod like Mr. Himmelfass in The Nutcracker. \nParrish still doesn't answer. \nALLISON (cont'd) You don't care, do you? \nPARRISH What, honey? \nALLISON I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect -- \nPARRISH (attentive now) I know you do, darling. \nALLISON And you could care less -- \nPARRISH Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it. \nALLISON Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play? \nA stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on Allison. \nPARRISH Tell it to me again. \nSuddenly, the Voice cuts in: \nVOICE (V.O.) ...Yes. \nParrish's head snaps, startled by the SOUND. \nVOICE (V.O., cont'd) (to Parrish) Did you miss me? \nParrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues: \nALLISON (to Parrish) Never mind.  Leave it to me. \nParrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice.  His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful. \nLUISA Mr. Parrish, dinner is served. \nALLISON (to Quince and Drew, across the room) Chow-time, you guys. \nParrish is confounded.  Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nAs a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the Voice once more: \nVOICE (V.O.) What are you looking so provoked about?  'Did you miss me?'  It's a normal question.  I missed you. But what do I get back?  'Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill --' \nParrish sits. \nVOICE (V.O., cont'd) '-- This relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice'. \nParrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic. \nVOICE (V.O., cont'd) I'm waiting outside. \nThe conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it: \nALLISON (to Drew) Did you speak to the Governor? \nDREW He's coming. \nALLISON His wife? \nDREW Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal. \nVOICE (V.O.) I'm waiting outside.  Won't someone come to the door? \nPARRISH I'm sorry -- \nVOICE In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested. \nParrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening. \nVOICE (cont'd) ...'Yes'. \nPARRISH Yes what? \nVOICE 'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion. \nPARRISH What question? \nVOICE Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- \nPARRISH The 'question' -- \nVOICE (urging) Yes, Bill.  The question. \nAfter a moment. \nPARRISH ...Am I going to die? \nThe figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re- vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off- center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful. \nYOUNG MAN Yes. \nA moment, Parrish beside himself.  He cannot bring himself to speak, finally: \nPARRISH Am I dreaming this? (Another moment) Are you a dream? \nYOUNG MAN I am not a dream. \nPARRISH You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you? \nThe Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man daring Parrish to identify him: \nPARRISH You are --? \nYOUNG MAN (urging again) '...Yes --' \nParrish turns away.  But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in front of him again. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) (gently) Who am I? \nPARRISH ...Death. \nParrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect. \nPARRISH (cont'd) You're Death? \nYOUNG MAN Yes. \nPARRISH Death! \nYOUNG MAN That's me. \nPARRISH You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants. \nYOUNG MAN The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in? \nA hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment. \nPARRISH You want me to be your guide --? \nYOUNG MAN You fill the bill, Bill. \nPARRISH I do? (a moment) How long will you be staying? \nYOUNG MAN You should hope quite a while. \nPARRISH And then --? \nThe Young Man nods, gently. \nPARRISH (cont'd) It's... it's... over. \nA long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in, the sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the door. \nLUISA (O.S.) Mr. Parrish? \nParrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside the Library. \nLUISA (cont'd) Will the gentleman be staying for dinner, sir? \nParrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa.  The Young Man interjects: \nYOUNG MAN (to Luisa) Yes. (a polite afterthought) Thank you. \nLuisa nods perfunctorily and exits.  Parrish is frozen, dumbfounded. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) (to Parrish) Where is dinner? \nParrish does not answer at first. \nPARRISH This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us. \nYOUNG MAN Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand? \nParrish is frightened by the response. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) Good.  Now lead the way. \nParrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer. \nPARRISH Excuse me?  Could I say something? \nYOUNG MAN Of course. \nPARRISH (quietly) It just occurred to me -- \nYOUNG MAN Speak up, please. \nDREW You and Bill old friends? \nParrish jumps in: \nPARRISH No -- \nDREW (to Joe) I get the feeling you've done some business before. \nJOE We have an arrangement now. \nDREW What side of the industry did you say you were on? \nJOE I didn't say. \nDREW (to Parrish) Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details? \nParrish falls silent again, looking for an answer. \nDREW (cont'd) I'm sorry -- business at dinner... (to Joe) Forgive me for being so rude. \nJOE Sure. \nThe doors to the dining room open, Susan appears. \nSUSAN Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late - had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief -- \nALLISON You ate? \nSUSAN ...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew -- \nShe kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob- viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air. \nAt the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions. \nSUSAN (cont'd) What are you doing here? \nSilence. \nPARRISH (stunned) You know each other? \nSUSAN (lightly) We've met. \nPARRISH What?! \nSUSAN -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor. \nQUINCE Well, I guess he's found one. \nDREW Joe, you do get around. \nJoe is happily confounded by all the interaction. \nSUSAN That's your name? \nALLISON And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight -- \nJoe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer. \nDREW Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying? \nJOE Here... \nDREW 'Here'? \nSUSAN In this house? \nQUINCE Great! \nParrish pushes his plate away. \nPARRISH Uh - will that hold you, Joe? \nSUSAN Incidentally, 'Joe' what? \nJOE Black. \nQUINCE Hey, this is fun. \nSUSAN So, what are you doing here? \nParrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer. \nSUSAN (cont'd) Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so silent this morning. \nDrew reacts to this allusion of intimacy. \nALLISON Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more --- \nPARRISH (to Joe) We've got some things to discuss. \nParrish stands, motions for Joe to rise. \nDREW (to Joe) -- Did I hear 'business'? \nSUSAN What 'business'? \nQUINCE Don't bother asking, we already tried. \nJOE It's so very nice to see you again. \nSUSAN Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter. \nPARRISH Cut it out, Susan. (to Joe) You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go. \nJoe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops: \nJOE (to Susan) Susan. (to Allison) Allison. (to Quince) Quince. (to Drew) Drew. (to Parrish) Bill... (to the group) Thank you. \nHe makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest door. \nPARRISH Joe, that's the kitchen. \nJOE Thank you. \nShe stops. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by the airlines.  Would you mind get- ting a few things together for him? A couple of suits, some shirts, ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle take his measurements off what he is wearing tonight. \nLUISA Certainly, sir. \nLuisa nods, and heads back downstairs.  Parrish enters his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle distance, ruminates. \nINT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nJoe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges on the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door, steps out into the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nJoe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein of water. \nINT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the \"back\" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor, the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters. \nINT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around. Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him for a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but- ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread. Joe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly. \nCOYLE Yes, sir? \nJOE Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you. \nCOYLE Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure. \nThe staff all mumble expansive \"Good evening, sir\"s to Joe. He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not.  Coyle shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having Parrish family or guests in this part of the house. \nJOE (to Coyle) What are you eating. \nCOYLE You mean this, sir? \nCoyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly. \nCOYLE (cont'd) Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter. \nJOE (carefully) 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'. (a moment) You like it? \nCOYLE I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan. (another moment) Like a taste? \nJoe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe.  Joe swallows it.  But he has not yet found a comfortable way of masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the staff observes him, fascinated. \nCOYLE (cont'd) You're a peanut butter man now, eh, sir? \nJOE Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed this - uh - peanut butter. (to the staff) And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you. \nJoe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff. \nJOE (cont'd) I'll be moseying on. \nHe heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer- ful \"Goodnight, Mr. Black\"'s, his tongue again licking the edges of the spoon. \nINT. SWIMMING POOL, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY \nA spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views of the skyline. \nSusan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is. \nSUSAN What are you doing here? \nJOE I'm lost. \nSUSAN -- Can't seem to escape you today. \nJOE I'm sorry. \nSusan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, points to a stack of towels. \nSUSAN Hand me one of those, will you? \nJoe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan. \nSUSAN (cont'd) You must have something really big going on with my father -- \nJOE 'Big'? \nSUSAN You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe. \nJOE I am Joe. \nSUSAN Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger. \nJOE That is not my intention. \nJoe continues to nibble at his peanut butter. \nSUSAN What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating? \nJOE (mumbles) Peanut butter. \nHe finishes the spoonful. \nJOE (cont'd) But it's gone now. \nHe shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.  Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels.  She watches, fascinat- ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful. \nSUSAN You act like you never had peanut butter before -- \nJOE I haven't. \nSUSAN -- What kind of childhood did you have? \nJOE Do you love Drew? \nSUSAN Come again? \nJOE When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing. \nSUSAN Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth. \nDREW (cont'd) Felicia? \nFELICIA (O.S.) Yes, sir? \nDREW Get me a Field Background check on Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt- cies.  Credit ratings.  The works. Got it? \nDrew hangs up. \nINT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY \nParrish enters, Joe right on his heels.  They booth stop, Parrish regards him. \nPARRISH -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end? \nJOE I don't understand. \nParrish tries to gather himself. \nPARRISH ...I'd like to be alone for a while. \nJOE Are you sad, Bill? \nPARRISH Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines? \nJOE You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill? \nPARRISH Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you. \nJOE Of course. \nBut Joe doesn't move. \nPARRISH (prompting) Now I'd like to be alone. \nJOE Oh.  Okay. \nParrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash. \nPARRISH Here -- this will hold you for a while. \nJoe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door. \nPARRISH (cont'd) You know about money, don't you? \nJOE It can't buy happiness? \nParrish opens the door. \nPARRISH Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city. \nJOE No thank you, Bill.  I can manage. \nJoe goes. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY \nSusan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on an examining table beside them.  As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area.  She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the corridor. \nSUSAN Joe -- \nJOE How nice you look.  Is that your uniform? \nSusan regards him. \nSUSAN Why did you come here? \nJoe doesn't have an answer. \nSUSAN (cont'd) Are you ill? \nJOE Oh goodness, no. \nSUSAN Then why are you here, Joe? \nJOE I came to see you. \nSUSAN I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then -- \nJOE Very well, I'll watch. \nSUSAN Watch me do what? \nJOE Whatever you do. \nSUSAN That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm -- \nJOE And I'll be a visitor. \nSUSAN Patients have visitors, not doctors. \nJOE I don't mind -- \nVisible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid- thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain. \nTEENA (urgently) Miss?  Miss Doctor? \nSUSAN (gently) Just a minute, please. \nTEENA Please.  My momma's sicker'n he is. \nEaster looks up and sees Joe.  She abruptly becomes still, eyes wide, as if sudden recognition. \nEASTER Obeah. \nTEENA No, Momma. \nBut Easter just stares at Joe, fearful. \nEASTER Obeah mon.  I gonna die. \nTEENA Momma, stop it. Is just a man. \nJoe looks at Easter, curiously. \nJOE (sincerely) Not now. \nSusan smiles gently. \nJOE (cont'd) Don't you want me to come again...? \nA moment. \nSUSAN I have to go, I'm sorry to say -- \nJOE Be sorry for nothing. \nAnother moment. \nSUSAN Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe. \nSusan turns to go, hesitates. \nJOE Good-bye, Susan. \nSusan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart. \nINT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nJennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and silver, but untouched. \nJoe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at Parrish's food. \nJOE Are you going to eat your lunch \nPARRISH It's all yours. \nJoe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated, Joe's chewing has improved. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Good? \nJOE Excellent.  What is it? \nPARRISH Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard. \nJoe takes another big bite. \nJOE Truly - uh - splendid. \nPARRISH Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife -- \nJOE (familiarly) Uh-huh. \nPARRISH Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that. \nSilence, Parrish getting lost in his memories. \nPARRISH (cont'd) -- Everything reminds me of her -- there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her -- One day she was here.  The next day she was gone.  What are you going to do? -- I guess you've heard all this a trillion times before. \nJOE And more. \nPARRISH Why didn't you stop me? \nJOE Well...I don't know. \nSilence. \nJOE (cont'd) How was it the first time you met her? \nPARRISH I thought you'd heard a trillion times -- \nJOE This part I'm interested in. \nA moment. \nPARRISH She had on this little blue suit -- with a little white collar that had little red piping on it -- \nJoe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has paused. \nPARRISH (cont'd) You could have put her under glass and I would have just stood and looked at her.  But when she spoke -- I loved the sound of her voice and her laugh -- (a moment) -- I couldn't get enough of her -- and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't gradually -- I realized I couldn't live without her. \nA KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish, then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway. \nDREW May I interrupting? \nJOE Yes. \nPARRISH No. \nDREW (to joe) 'Just kidding'? \nPARRISH Sit down, Drew. \nDREW Before I do -- (glances at Joe) I was hoping we might be alone, Bill. \nPARRISH Joe and I have no secrets from each other. \nDREW (to Joe) How nice for you both. \nDrew takes a moment, then plunges in. \nDREW (cont'd) Bill, pardon my candor, but I was confounded by your decision this morning. \nPARRISH Why? \nDREW I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle -- \nJoe interrupts: \nJOE Perhaps a merger is a way to bring Bill's company into the 21st cen- tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And perhaps cheating on your French Philosophers exam at The Groton School was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't. Be that as it may, Drew, a question can often be argued both ways. \nDrew is stunned. \nPARRISH Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew. \nDREW (to Parrish) I thought this was practically a done deal -- \nPARRISH Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it. \nDREW 'It's up to Joe', huh? \nQUINCE Yeah, that's what he said. \nDREW Well, that's very interesting. \nDrew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan, for the moment by herself near the piano. \nQUINCE I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy. \nDREW Yeah.  Neat. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJoe approaches Susan. \nJOE I wanted to apologize, Susan -- \nSUSAN I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'. \nJOE Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon. \nSUSAN It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome. \nJOE I appreciate you -- \nSUSAN Excuse me? \nJOE I mean I appreciate that. \nSUSAN And I appreciate you, too. \nA moment between them. \nJOE (delighted) You do?  Well, thank you very much. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDrew crosses over to Parrish. \nPARRISH I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice. \nDREW As much as Joe's? \nParrish doesn't answer. \nDREW (cont'd) Who is this man?  He's giving ubiquitous a bad name. \nA moment. \nPARRISH You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around. \nDREW For how long?  And why? \nPARRISH Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him. \nDrew glances over at Joe. \nDREW Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at following them.  And I think I'll start right now. \nAllison calls out from the other side of the room: \nALLISON Dinner's ready, everybody! \nA BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe. \nDREW I have a confession to make to you, Joe. \nJoe just smiles in response. \nDREW (cont'd) Do you want to hear it? \nJOE (pleasantly) No. \nDREW Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat. \nINT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nEveryone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the other hand, just eats. \nBreaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands. \nPARRISH -- I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family -- \nEveryone at the table is all attention. \nPARRISH (cont'd) -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and the other members -- \nHe glances at Joe, stops. \nPARRISH (cont'd) -- I'm so happy when we can get together -- I mean I know you all have busy lives -- \nSUSAN Look who's talking. \nALLISON (a laugh) Yeah, speak for yourself. \nPARRISH Anyway -- I remember when you were little girls -- \nAn awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence. \nQUINCE I love little girls -- \nAllison elbows him. \nPARRISH And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um -- \nParrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew clocking his behavior very carefully. \nPARRISH (cont'd) I had some words all prepared but now I've forgotten them - uh - um - wait a minute. \nSilence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the tip of my tongue. \nPARRISH Why did you go to the hospital? \nJOE I don't know. \nPARRISH You were just curious? \nJOE I guess... \nPARRISH About Susan? \nJOE I wouldn't put it that way. \nPARRISH What way would you put it? \nJOE You tell me, Bill. \nPARRISH How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire. \nJOE Are you going to fire me, Bill? \nSilence, Parrish is at a loss. \nINT. FOYER - NIGHT \nDrew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between them, a heavy silence finally broken. \nSUSAN ...See you tomorrow night. \nDREW Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations. \nSUSAN You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy -- \nDREW Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe. (a moment) And so do you. \nSUSAN Drew, you're out of line. \nDREW That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa. \nSUSAN Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay? \nDREW No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here. (a moment) It shows you never know. \nSilence, neither knows how to continue. \nSUSAN Well... goodnight. \nDREW Yeah.  Goodnight. \nDrew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer, he's been observing them.  She walks up to him. \nSUSAN How long have you been standing there? \nJOE I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back. \nA moment. \nSUSAN Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who you are.  What you're doing with my father. \nSusan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks. \nSUSAN (cont'd) So you're not going to tell me? \nJoe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's inquiries. \nSUSAN (cont'd) You're married, aren't you? \nJOE Why? \nSUSAN Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married. \nJoe doesn't respond. \nSUSAN (cont'd) So you are married. \nJOE No, I'm not. \nSUSAN Girlfriend? \nJOE No. \nSUSAN Gay? \nJOE No. \nSusan comes closer to Joe. \nSUSAN Then tell me, Joe, how come a man as attractive, intelligent, well- spoken ,diffident in the most sed- uctive way, and yet powerful, is all alone in this world? \nJoe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by Susan. \nSUSAN (cont'd) I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and you don't want to tell me.  So let's leave it a mystery.  That's the way you want it, isn't it? \nSusan takes another step closer to Joe. \nJOE Thank you, I appreciate that. \nThey are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the stairs. \nSUSAN Where are you going? \nJOE (softly) To bed. \nSUSAN (suddenly fragile) 'To bed'? \nJOE Yes.  I'm tired. \nHe excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the stairs, Susan watches him disappear. \nShe turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are exiting, \"good-byes\" all around.  Susan is left alone now with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar. \nPARRISH That was wonderful. \nSUSAN Yeah, it's good to get together. \nALLISON (cont'd) (to Quince) Did you hear that? \nQuince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite. \nQUINCE This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- (to Parrish) Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world. \nPARRISH No thank you, Quince. (to Allison) I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like? \nALLISON I knew you were going to say that. Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now the cake.  You just don't care.  Why did I do this?  I should have my head examined.  I'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father - and you know what -- he doesn't give a shit. \nShe bursts into tears all over again. \nQUINCE But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill? \nPARRISH Yeah, I give a shit. \nQUINCE See.  There.  What'd I tell you? \nJoe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin. \nQUINCE (cont'd) Feel better? \nALLISON Yeah, but -- \nQUINCE But what? \nALLISON What will I tell Annie? \nParrish forks a bit of a cake. \nPARRISH This one. \nQUINCE The vodka.  What'd I tell you? \nQuince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans- pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation- ship. \nINT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nAfter dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to- gether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy. \nJOE (to Quince) Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males. \nQUINCE I didn't know that. \nJOE On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one. \nAfter a moment. \nQUINCE You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe... \nJOE And you're a nice man, Quince. \nQUINCE Thanks. \nJOE You're welcome. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDrew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems surprised to see him. \nDREW (to Parrish) Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown -- it's not something we could talk about on the phone. \nParrish takes Drew aside. \nDREW (cont'd) The Board's real unhappy, Pappy -- they felt you dealt with them pre- emptorily, you never gave them a chance to speak -- \nPARRISH What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now. \nDREW Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs. \nPARRISH What are their feelings? \nDREW If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer. \nPARRISH Over my dead body. \nParrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison. \nDREW What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that? \nPARRISH I don't care. \nDREW With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor. \nSilence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark. \nPARRISH Whose? \nDREW Yours. \nPARRISH I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me. \nDREW I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth. \nJoe, although across the room, is all attention. \nPARRISH I think it's time you went home, Drew. \nDREW Certainly.  Goodnight. \nDrew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into the hallway. \nSUSAN Drew! \nHe stops. \nSUSAN (cont'd) Never talk to my father like that again. \nDREW Don't worry about it.  There's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything.  And I think I've come to the end of my chapter with the Parrishes. \nJoe has followed them into the hallway. \nDREW (cont'd) And the end began with this guy. \nSUSAN (cont'd) Don't I? \nHer question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan takes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him. \nSUSAN Goodnight, Daddy. \nShe drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's. \nJOE Hello, Bill. \nPARRISH (carefully) Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap? \nJOE Um -- not right now. \nAn awkward moment. \nPARRISH Okay.  Goodnight. \nJOE Goodnight. \nParrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in the scent of his collar. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EXECUTIVE SUITE, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY \nParrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator, is greeted as usual: \nJENIFER Good morning, Mr. Parrish. \nPARRISH Good morning, Jennifer. \nJENIFER The Board is waiting. \nPARRISH What? \nJENIFER Didn't you call a Board meeting? \nJennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she knows better than to press the point. \nJENIFER (cont'd) Yes, the members are waiting.  They are in the Board room now. \nJennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room, Joe right beside him. \nINT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY \nParrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ- ing Drew, Quince and Sloane. \nPARRISH Good morning. \nAn odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob- lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control. \nDREW Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill? \nPARRISH I don't think so.  Do you? \nDrew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew. \nDREW (to Parrish) To get to the point, we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you. \nA moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer. \nPARRISH That's it? \nDREW Bontecou wants a quick response and -- \nPARRISH The answer is no, quick enough for you? \nDREW Don't you want to hear the details? \nPARRISH I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you. \nDREW So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer? \nPARRISH Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question? \nDREW Certainly, Bill. \nPARRISH Are you running this Board or am I? \nSloane leans in. \nSLOANE We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week -- \nDREW Bontecou wants a speedier response than that. \nSLOANE He'll wait -- \nPARRISH Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'. \nA BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence under Parrish's withering glance. \nPARRISH (cont'd) That's it?  I've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind.  Shall we adjourn? \nDREW Before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the Board would like a response to, a far simpler one. \nParrish waits. \nDREW (cont'd) Who is the man sitting to the right of you? \nEverybody's eyes are on Joe. \nPARRISH I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all. \nDREW But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you? \nNo response from Parrish. \nDREW (cont'd) The feeling of the Board is this: we fear Mr. Black is not only influenc- ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you. \nQuince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still does not answer. \nDREW (cont'd) The lack of response, Bill, is not appropriate.  We are your Board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you. \nA moment. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Are you hungry?  Coyle will have Luisa fix you something to eat. \nJOE I'm not hungry. \nPARRISH Then I can't help you. \nParrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently behind him.  Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest wing. \nINT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY \nMidday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises again, crosses back to the sitting room. \nSusan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns around. \nSUSAN You're here? \nJOE I am. \nHe stands, they regard each other for the moment. \nJOE (cont'd) May I take your coat? \nShe doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the scent at the back of her neck. \nSUSAN I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood -- \nJOE How beautiful. \nHe starts to hang Susan's coat up. \nSUSAN Just throw it on the chair. \nJoe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot. \nSUSAN (cont'd) When I called, they said that you and Daddy had just left the office. \nJOE He's taking a nap. \nSUSAN He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing -- \nJOE Yes, he's tired.  I believe so. \nA moment. \nJOE (cont'd) You must be hungry? \nSusan sits on the couch. \nSUSAN No, not anymore.  Are you? \nJoe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the couch beside her. \nSUSAN (cont'd) (after a moment) Are you cold? \nJOE ...No. \nSUSAN Maybe it's the draft through the door. \nShe gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know- ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it before. \nStrange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert- ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak- ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences. \nSpent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks: \nSUSAN It's so wonderful to make love to you.  It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before. \nJoe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. He weighs, then resists, the impulse. \nJOE Thank you. \nHer head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so. \nSUSAN Did you like making love to me? \nJOE I loved it. \nSUSAN More than you love peanut butter? \nJOE Yes! \nShe laughs at the earnestness with which he answers. \nJoe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land. \nSUSAN Where are you going? \nJOE Nowhere?  I'm...here. \nSUSAN For how long? \nJOE Oh, I hope a long, long time. \nA moment. \nSUSAN Me, too. \nAnother moment. \nJOE What do we do now? \nShe smiles. \nSUSAN It will come to us. \nINT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE (LATER) - DAY \nJoe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.  The kiss lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door softly after her. \nHe turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan. \nJOE Hello, Bill. \nJOE Yah. \nEASTER You loved back? \nJOE I am. \nEASTER She knows you real self? \nJOE She knows how she feel. \nEASTER (scoffing) Rass! \nJOE (irritably) Don' need you okayin'. \nEASTER Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting. \nJOE Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back. \nEASTER (stubbornly) Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty. \nJOE Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid! \nSilence, Easter waits, watching Joe. \nEASTER You not in you right place, mistah. \nEaster's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then back at her, she had clearly reached him. \nEASTER (cont'd) I ain' either.  No more.  You come wi' me now.  Take me. \nJOE But I not lonely here.  Somebody want me here. \nEaster considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically. \nEASTER It nice it happen to you.  It like you came to Cat Island and you had a holiday, sun didn't burn you red, just brown, sleep no mosquito eat you, rum no poung you head nex' day. But trut' is, dat bound to happen, you stay long enough.  So tak dat nice picture home wi' you, but don' be fooled.  We lonely here mostly, too.  If we lucky, we got some nice pictures. \nEaster drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense they understand each other.  Easter shifts, trying hard to ease her discomfort. \nJOE (gently) Got enough nice pictured, Easter. \nShe looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes. Joe watches her, now his eyes close.  Easter exhales raspingly, falls still.  The monitors flatline.  A beeping alarm sound somewhere down the hall. \nJoe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled. \nJOE (cont'd) G'bye, sistah. \nShe slips out of the room. \nINT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nParrish is playing solitaire.  The SOUND of the front door closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer door is Susan. \nPARRISH Hello, honey. \nHe starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks around now. \nSUSAN Where's Joe? \nPARRISH Joe? \nA silence. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Joe's not around. \nSUSAN Where is he? \nPARRISH I don't know. \nSusan seems distracted. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Why are you looking for Joe? \nSUSAN Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe. \nPARRISH I don't understand. \nSUSAN Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived. \nParrish blinks, stares down at his cards. \nPARRISH This is crazy -- \nSUSAN Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me? \nPARRISH You don't know anything about Joe -- \nSUSAN What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom. (a moment) That's always been standard, whether you like or not. \nParrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now. \nPARRISH Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long. \nSUSAN Where's he going? \nPARRISH I don't know, I can't say -- \nSUSAN C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works -- \nPARRISH In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground. \nSusan doesn't answer for a moment. \nSUSAN I love him. \nPARRISH I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you! \nA moment. \nSUSAN Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry. \nThere is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in.  Parrish slumps. \nSUSAN (cont'd) I love you, too. \nParrish shakes his head. \nPARRISH You are amazing.  Why, oh why, Allison, are you doing all this? \nBut before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone. \nALLISON I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you. \nPARRISH Yeah?  And what about my enemies? \nALLISON They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love? \nUnexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it. \nALLISON (cont'd) Above all, you've been a wonderful father. \nPARRISH I haven't been the father to you that -- \nALLISON That you've been to Susan? \nPARRISH I wasn't going to say -- \nALLISON But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, \"What does she want now?\" \nA weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th Infantry Regiment  \"C\" (Charlie) Company. \nALLISON (cont'd) I already feel I've had everything I could have wanted for my birthday -- \nPARRISH Hey, there's lots to come. (gesturing to me activity) A little excess -- like you love. \nThe preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate plans coming to fruition. \nPARRISH You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party. \nALLISON (gently) Yes, it is. \nAllison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her. \nEXT. WINE BAR, LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON \nAmbrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni- forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust. \nQUINCE Give me a Seagrams and '7'. \nAmbrose looks at him blankly. \nQUICNCE (cont'd) No got?  Okay a double V.O., water back. \nAMBROSE I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince. \nQUINCE Okay, give me a bottle of wine. \nAMBROSE Red or white? \nQUINCE Both. \nJoe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his traps past on a little cart.  Joe doesn't seem to know where he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this oasis.  Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs. \nQUINCE (cont'd) (to Joe) Red or white? \nJOE No, thank you. \nQuince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of each into one glass. \nQUINCE C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me. \nJOE Do I?  I'm a little confused. \nQUINCE Confused, huh?  About what? \nJOE Love. \nQUINCE 'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own. \nJOE You love Allison, don't you? \nQUINCE Oh yes, I do. \nJOE How did you meet? \nQUINCE I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in. \nJOE But she loves you? \nQuince smiles, nods embarrassedly. \nJOE (cont'd) How do you know? \nQUINCE Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter. \nJOE 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'? \nQUINCE Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free. \nJOE What do you mean 'free'? \nQUINCE Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear. \nQuince seems uncharacteristically within himself. \nQUINCE (cont'd) All that hoopla up there reminds me how I will never measure up to a man like Bill Parrish - or his daughter. \nHe drains his wine. \nQUINCE (cont'd) Do you like me, Joe? \nJOE Oh yes, you are one of my favorites. \nQUINCE What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? (a moment) I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do? \nJoe regards Quince. \nJOE Go to Bill Parrish and tell him everything.  He'll forgive you. \nQUINCE ...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted -- \nPARRISH It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong. \nA KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears. \nJOE Excuse me -- \nHe starts to step out. \nQUINCE Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill? \nPARRISH Sure. \nAs Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him. \nQUINCE (to Parrish) Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean? \nPARRISH Yes, I believe I do. \nQuince now drifts off. \nQUICHE Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys got business -- \nPARRISH No, I'm out of business, right, Quince?  However I do have some unfinished business -- with Drew. Get him out here.  Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night.  I want to tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face. \nQUINCE Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt that Drew's anxious to see you face-to-face. \nJoe steps in. \nJOE (to Quince) Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost.  The race is to the swift, but could Drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow Bill to save face.  Tell him Bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's the night to do it.  He'll introduce Drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from Washington and Drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine. \nParrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging admiration.  He nods to Joe, summarizes: \nPARRISH (to Quince) All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings. \nQUINCE You think Drew will go for it? \nPARRISH Quince, I've got confidence in you. \nQUINCE Sir, I'll deliver the package. \nHe heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent. \nPARRISH Thanks. \nJOE Not at all. \nA moment. \nJOE (cont'd) How are you doing? \nPARRISH What the hell do you care? \nJOE I was just asking, Bill. \nPARRISH You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death. \nAnother moment. \nJOE -- And I'm in love with your daughter. \nPARRISH Say again? \nJOE I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight. \nParrish is stunned. \nPARRISH You're what? \nJOE I think you heard me, Bill. \nPARRISH You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway? \nJoe doesn't answer for a moment. \nPARRISH (cont'd) I thought we had a deal. \nJOE I'm sorry, Bill -- \nPARRISH Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted. \nJOE I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand. \nPARRISH How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love -- \nJOE Then what is it? \nPARRISH Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters. \nJOE Which is what? \nPARRISH Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love. \nJOE So that's what love is? \nPARRISH Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about. \nJOE Those were my words, Bill. \nPARRISH Well, they're mine now. \nJoe is silent for a moment, cogitating. \nJOE Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me. \nPARRISH With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are? \nJOE No. \nPARRISH Does she know where she's going? \nJoe doesn't answer. \nSUSAN -- Yes? \nJOE Thank you for loving me. \nShe smiles wanly, Joe leaves her. \nINT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT \nParrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself. \nJoe enters, Parrish looks up. \nJOE ...We should think about getting started, Bill. \nParrish waits. \nJOE (cont'd) It'll just be us. \nThe tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath. \nPARRISH Thank you. \nJoe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain. Parrish regards him sympathetically. \nThe silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door.  Parrish, out of politeness to Joe, does not respond. \nQUINCE (O.S.) Bill --? \nAfter a moment. \nPARRISH Come in. \nQuince appears, flushed with excitement. \nQUINCE -- I got him.  The chopper's two minutes away. \nParrish weighs the information for a moment. \nPARRISH (to Joe) How are we on time? \nJoe shrugs, nods gently. \nJOE Okay. \nPARRISH (to Quince) Get him in here. \nQuince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker- phone. \nPARRISH (cont'd) ...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I want you to put in a call to Eddie Sloane for me -- \nMAY (O.S.) At home, sir --? \nPARRISH No, he's at the office. \nEXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT \nAn area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades stop spinning.  Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens it and Drew steps out.  Quince leads the way through the lights and MUSIC.  Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony. \nDREW This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart. \nQUINCE He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary. \nDREW He said that? \nQUINCE Well, you've got him by the short- hairs. \nDREW Yeah, the short, gray hairs. \nHe flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study. \nINT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT \nParrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room. \nSLOANE (O.S.) (speakerphone) We're all here, Bill -- \nPARRISH I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- (a moment) -- or not.  Either way, thanks. \nSLOANE (O.S.) (speakerphone) We're all ears. \nDrew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and closes the door behind him. \nDREW Hi, Bill, happy birthday -- \nA moment. \nDREW (cont'd) I just wanted to say how appre- ciative I am of this - uh - grand gesture and -- \nPARRISH Shut up and sit down. \nDrew takes a seat. \nPARRISH (cont'd) You're a worthless sack of shit, you fucked me over, played footsie with John Bontecou, sold my company out to line your own pockets. \nDREW I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed -- \nPARRISH The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all. \nDREW Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since. \nJoe can no longer control himself. \nJOE You're the poison, Drew.  You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature.  I've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter.  And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity.  Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that.  And now I must release him from that vow.  Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who I am. \nParrish is struck dumb.  He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and then commandingly. \nDREW (to Parrish) So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants. \nJOE -- And now you're going to pee some more. \nPARRISH Joe, don't do this -- \nJOE It's time to put this person where he belongs. \n", "test1_input": "SUSAN ...There's a start for a meeting. \nPARRISH I know it's none of my business -- \nSusan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her father on the cheek. \nSUSAN No, it's none of your business. \nAnother moment. \nPARRISH Do you love Drew? \nSUSAN You mean like you loved Mom? \nPARRISH Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him? \nSUSAN Probably. \nA moment. \nPARRISH (smiles) Don't get carried away. \nSUSAN Uh oh -- \nPARRISH Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful -- \nSUSAN And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me. \nPARRISH Well, I wasn't going to say that -- \nSUSAN What were you going to say? \nPARRISH Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it. \nSUSAN So what's wrong with that? \nPARRISH That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say. \nSUSAN You're not listening -- \nPARRISH Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice. \nSUSAN Don't get dirty, Dad -- \nPARRISH Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish. \nSUSAN That's all? \nPARRISH Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be. \nSUSAN 'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost -- \nHe smiles. \nPARRISH I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart. (a moment) Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived. \nSUSAN Bravo. \nPARRISH Aw, you're tough. \nSUSAN I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version. \nPARRISH Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike. \nSilence. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Forgive the lecture -- \nSUSAN I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either. \nPARRISH You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton. \nSUSAN You're terrible. \nPARRISH I know.  But I'm the only father you've got. \nShe kisses him on the cheek. \nSUSAN Thank God. \nPARRISH He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway. \nEXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nThe AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart, rushes to open the door and unload the bags.  The passengers, Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator. \nINT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nParrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride downwards. \nQUINCE Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it -- (indicates Drew and Parrish) -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me? \nDREW Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might -- \nQUINCE I know.  Gum up the works. \nParrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince when the Voice suddenly intrudes: \nVOICE (V.O.) '...I know, it's none of my business.' \nPARRISH What? \nDREW I was saying to Quince we won't need -- \nPARRISH Did you just hear something? \nDREW Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince -- \nPARRISH No no, not you. \nSUSAN Daddy, what's the matter? \nPARRISH Nothing.  I'm sorry. \n", "test1_true": "VOICE (V.O.) '...I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.' \nParrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts: \nSUSAN What is it, Daddy --? \nPARRISH Nothing. \nParrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a thing but him. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Just talking to myself again.  You know me -- \nThe elevator door opens. \nPARRISH Well, here we are -- \nParrish leads the group out. \nEXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nThey exit the building. \nSUSAN (to Parrish) Are you okay? \nPARRISH A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action. \nSUSAN Well, go get 'em, Pops. \nPARRISH Yer damn right. \nParrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine, Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab. \nINT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nDREW ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far? \nPARRISH Sounds good. \nDREW It's going to be great -- \nPARRISH Do you think I need a haircut? \nDREW Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one. \nParrish smiles, they step into the elevator. \nINT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY \nParrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing the overkill decor. \nDREW Their PR guy asked me, what did I think Parrish Communications stood for, that's principle and ethics- wise?  I came up with something, but then it occurred to me, why don't I ask Bill?  What do you think? \nA moment, Parrish shrugs. \nPARRISH Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time. \nDREW That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou. \nDrew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec- utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white- haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55. \nBONTECOU Bill, thanks for coming over... (to Drew) And how're you doing today, Drew? (to Parrish) You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table. \nPARRISH Good, good.  Glad to hear it. \nBONTECOU We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was? \nPARRISH I'm sorry, I don't recall -- \nBONTECOU Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes -- \nPARRISH I thought you were buying my company. \nBONTECOU Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint. \nSilence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits', Bontecou holding away. \nPARRISH Well, that's very nice to hear. \nDrew nods excitedly. \nEXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY \nThe busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue. \nINT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY \nA thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors, residents and interns. \nSusan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her speaking into the pay phone. \nAn attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder. \nYOUNG MAN ...Honey, you've got to go on... there's a time to sow and a time to reap, you sow now and forget about him... yeah, I liked him, I don't like him anymore... because you're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me -- I'm on a plane in a minute... as soon as I get my phone in, you're my first call, that's a promise... where you going now?... good, hit the books, get that degree, one day we'll hang out a shingle together... you bet, honey... later. \nThe Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take her eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly. \nYOUNG MAN Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry. \nSUSAN Not at all.  It was fascinating. \nYOUNG MAN Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it? \nSUSAN You and 'Honey'? \nYOUNG MAN My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school. \nSUSAN I'm sorry -- \nYOUNG MAN Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it? \nSUSAN What's the way? \nYOUNG MAN Nothing lasts. \n", "test1_id": 1383, "test2_input": "Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes it.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile. \nEXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nParrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per- fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.  Parrish senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check- ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high-rises. \nPARRISH You know, I got to thinking last night -- with you here, and seem- ingly occupied, how's your work going - uh - elsewhere? \nA flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but he is concentrating on Parrish's words. \nJOE When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right? \nPARRISH What do you mean? \nJOE You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right? \nPARRISH I guess so. \nJOE So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere. \nPARRISH Of course. \nJOE So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about. \nParrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition. \nPARRISH Joe --? \nJOE Yes, Bill. \nPARRISH How about giving a guy a break? \nJOE Make an exception? \nPARRISH There's one to every rule. \nJOE Not this. \nThey stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un- characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out: \nPARRISH -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time -- \nJOE That's what everybody says. \nPARRISH I'm not everybody. \nJOE That's what everybody says. \nParrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe. \nPARRISH I want to live. \nJOE I understand. \nA moment. \nJOE (cont'd) But you can't. \nA sudden silence between them.  Parrish's shoulders appear to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais- ing these issues has vanished. \nPARRISH What's it like? \nJOE What do you mean? \nPARRISH What's it like where I'm going? \nJOE Can you keep a secret? \nPARRISH Yes. \nJOE So can I. \nThey turn into Parrish's office building. \nINT. LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY \nAs Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the Elevator Starter. \nJAIME Good morning, Mr. Parrish. \nPARRISH Good morning, Jaime. \nJAIME Knight's Reward in the 4th at Calder -- \nA bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing them. \nJAIME (cont'd) -- A closer in today with cheap speed.  The colt will come from the clouds and boom!  Fifty-eight dollar horse.  I get you down, Mr. Parrish, just say the word. \nPARRISH (smiles) I'm sorry, not today, Jaime. \nParrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators.  Jaime, back at his post, hits a button. \nPARRISH (cont'd) (to Joe) You know, everyday I've walked into this building, Jaime gives me a horse. (a moment) I wonder if any of them won. \nThe elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on. \nINT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN - DAY \nParrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer is waiting as usual with her pad, \"Good morning\"s, etc.  As Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along behind them. \nPARRISH -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight. \nJENIFER Didn't the family get together last night --? \nPARRISH (remonstrating, gently) Jennifer. \nJENIFER Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away. \nJennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room. \nPARRISH (to Joe) Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --? \nJOE No. \n", "test2_true": "JOE I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem. \nParrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob. \nINT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY \nParrish enters, Joe following right behind him.  A euphony of \"Good morning\"'s from the various members of the Board, including Quince.  Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe, right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas- tries, he heads for them. \nPARRISH (to the Board) -- This is Joe Black, a personal associate of mine - uh - he'll be joining us today.  I know it's -- uh -- unusual, and my apologies -- and Drew -- uh -- carry on. \nImmediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded but intense. \nDREW (after a moment, to Joe) Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing. \nJOE Thank you. \nDREW (to the Board) The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- \nJOE (to Drew) Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies? \nA hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter- ruption. \nJOE (cont'd) And a cup of tea.  With milk, I think.  I'd like to try it English- style.  Yes, a cup of tea with milk. \nDREW Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water? \nJOE Why yes, thank you. \nDREW Hot or cold. \nJOE Cold. \nDREW And a glass. \nDrew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments. \nPARRISH (quietly, indicating a chair) Would you like to sit down, Joe? \nJOE Yes. \nJoe sits. \nDREW To review -- we're really crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's here. Bill had a great and conclusive meeting with John Bontecou yester- day, all that remains for us is to put it to a vote. \nSmiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the Board at Drew's news. \nPARRISH (emptily) Thank you, Drew. \nParrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous, reflective, deeply felt. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I was interested in meeting John yes- terday -- impressive... I suppose... But it did get me to thinking.  I started in this business because this is what I wanted to do.  I knew I wasn't going to write the Great American Novel, but I also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.  I wanted to give the news to the world, and I wanted to give it unvarnished.  The more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. Sure, I want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but John Bontecou is all profit.  If we give him license to absorb Parrish Communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to reach the world you will have to go through John Bontecou.  And not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him.  Reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable.  Parrish Communications has earned this priv- ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy it.  As your chairman, I urge you to agree this company is not for sale. \nA silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is trying to maintain his balance. \nDREW (carefully) ...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion. \nPARRISH (to the Board) Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field. \nDREW That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes. \nJoe interjects: \nJOE 'Death and Taxes'? \nAfter a moment. \nDREW Yes. \nJOE \"Death and Taxes\"? \nAnother moment. \nDREW Yes. \nJOE What an odd pairing. \nDREW It's just a saying, Mr. Black, \nJOE Of whom? \nDREW It doesn't matter. \nJOE Then why did you bring it up? \nDrew regards Joe. \nDREW You're not familiar with the phrase, \"In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes\"? \nPARRISH I am now. \nDREW Glad I could be of some help. \nThe Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks the silence. \nPARRISH Shall we adjourn? \nDREW But the matter's still on the table, Bill -- \nEDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily silent, but extremely observant.  Protective of Parrish, and sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts: \nSLOANE Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air? \nPARRISH Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we? \nJoe rises. \nJOE (to Drew) Those cookies were excellent. \nHe exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them.  A BABBLE of disturbed reactions from the Board. \nDREW Who is that guy? \nDrew grabs a telephone: \n", "test2_id": 1384, "test3_input": "PARRISH (gently) I'm sorry. \nSusan is examining Parrish very closely. \nSUSAN Are you relieved? \nPARRISH Yes, but -- \nParrish hesitates. \nSUSAN But what? \nPARRISH I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me. \nSUSAN Daddy -- \nPARRISH No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. (a moment) -- And I have no regrets. \nSusan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer. \nPARRISH (cont'd) And I want you to feel that way, too. \nSUSAN I love you, Daddy -- \nPARRISH That's why it's okay. \nThey drift into silence. \nPARRISH (cont'd) No regrets? \nAfter a moment. \nSUSAN 'No regrets'. \nA long silence, Susan smiles. \nPARRISH It's a good feeling, isn't it? \nSilence again. \nSUSAN Everybody's saying goodbye... \nThey regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding. \nPARRISH I'm still here. (a moment) Would you like to dance with me, Susan? \nSUSAN Oh, yes -- \nHe starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops. \nPARRISH If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me. \nSUSAN Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old. \nHe takes her in his arms and they dance away. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOn a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops. \nWAITER Can I get you anything, sir? \nJoe regards the Waiter for a moment. \nJOE Do you have any peanut butter? \nThe Waiter hesitates. \nWAITER I don't think so, sir. \nJOE Thank you, anyway. \nThe Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOn the dance floor. \nPARRISH What was that? \nSUSAN The fireworks are about to start. \nParrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. \nSUSAN (cont'd) (to Parrish) Shall we? \nPARRISH You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath. \nSuddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. \nJoe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches. \nJOE Happy Birthday, Bill. \nPARRISH Thank you. \nThey watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe's gaze lingers. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Did you say goodbye? \nJOE Not exactly. \nPARRISH I guess you have your reasons. \nJOE Yes. \nSilence. \nPARRISH Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan? \nJoe waits. \nPARRISH (cont'd) I never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you -- It was always what I wanted for her -- but what happens to her now? \n", "test3_true": "Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues: \nJOE (cont'd) And would you mind if I expressed my gratitude...? \nParrish waits. \nJOE (cont'd) For you.  For the time you've given me.  For the person you are. \nA moment. \nPARRISH Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy. \nJoe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching. \nPARRISH (cont'd) It's hard to let go, isn't it? \nJOE Yes. \nPARRISH That's life.  What can I tell you? \nA silence, an understanding there is another more to say. Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say \"Shall we?\", Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDown below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some- thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nUp the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him. \nPARRISH I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping -- \nBut Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step with him. \nPARRISH (cont'd) Should I be afraid? \nJoe stops, Parrish stops with him. \nJOE Not a man like you. \nParrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDown below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. \nSusan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him. \nSUSAN Joe...? \nHe smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close. \nSUSAN (cont'd) You're here... \nHe is trying to get his bearings. \nJOE -- You bet. \nSomething about him makes Susan slightly tentative. \nSUSAN Where did you go? \nJoe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place. \nJOE I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out? \nSome realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded. \nJOE (cont'd) ...But now I'm back. \nSusan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer. \nSUSAN (gently) That's it? \nJOE Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party -- \nSUSAN You think so? \nJOE Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here. \nSusan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away. \nSusan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken, a sudden intake of breath. \nYOUNG MAN Hey, you all right? \nHis hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support. \nSUSAN The coffee shop -- \nThe Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition. \nYOUNG MAN I asked you if I said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you. \nSusan holds herself very still. \nYOUNG MAN (cont'd) And forgive me for saying this -- but then you said -- and it's been with me ever since -- \nSUSAN What has --? \nHe hesitates. \nYOUNG MAN You said you liked me. \nSUSAN No -- \nYOUNG MAN Y'didn't? \nA moment. \nSUSAN I said I liked you so much. \nShe falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain. \n", "test3_id": 1385}

{"train": "CRIME SPREE \nWritten by \nBrad Mirman \nFirst Draft, March 1996 \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \nINT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT \nPitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices. NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted. \nDANIEL (whispering) Turn on the flashlight. \nJULIEN I'm trying.    It doesn't work. \nDANIEL It has to work. You just bought it this afternoon. \nA beat. \nJULIEN Do they come with batteries? \nDANIEL You didn't buy batteries? \nJULIEN I thought they came with batteries. \nDANIEL I can't believe you didn't check. \nJULIEN I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list. \nDANIEL Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires. \nEXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT \nA wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits nervously. \nINT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT \nDark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. Daniel rolls up the canvas. \nDANIEL Let's go. \nJulien starts to pick up the ZIPPO. \nDANIEL Be careful it's... \nToo Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire. \nDANIEL ... hot! \nJulien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief. Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat. Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined. \nEXT. STREET -- NIGHT \nA Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away. \nINT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT \nDaniel and Julien move through the darkness. \nDANIEL Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house! \nJulien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed. \nOLD MAN'S VOICE Don't move! \nThey turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun. Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom. Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless. \nJULIEN Is he dead? \nDANIEL I don't know.     He looks dead. \nJULIEN He looked dead before he fell. \nThe old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun. Daniel and Julien run to the door. \nEXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT \nDaniel and Julien run towards the street. \nDANIEL Start the car! Start the car! \nRaymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat. Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth. \nINT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS \nDaniel is still staring at the closet. \nBASTALDI Hey Daniel! Hello? (snaps his fingers) Do you guys speak English? \nDANIEL Uh, yeah. \nBASTALDI Good.   I have a job for you in America. \nBastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck. \nBASTALDI The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom. \nJULIEN It seems like a long way to go for a necklace. \nDANIEL Besides, we don't know the city and-- \nMARCEL (overlapping) Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. (More) \nMARCEL (Cont'd) He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go! \nBASTALDI Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation. \nDANIEL C'mon, Laurant, America? \nBASTALDI The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow. \nThey know they don't have a choice. \nJULIEN We're going to need to find someone who knows the city. \nMARCEL I know someone. \nEXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY \nThe plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a \"I Love Paris\" tee-shirt. He passes a MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets. He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees... \nHIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving towards him . He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd. \nINT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY \nSami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile. NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted. \nMARCEL Going somewhere? \nSAMI Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run. \nA long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him. \nSAMI You're probably here for the money I owe you. (off Marcel's nod) I don't have it. Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside. \nINT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nMarcel closes the door.   He is face to face with Sami. \nSAMI You know this is how rumors get started. \nMarcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act. \nSAMI Told you. \nMarcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet. \nMARCEL Today's your lucky day, Sami. \nSAMI (breathlessly) Yeah, I can see that. \nMARCEL Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them. \nSAMI Me? \nMARCEL You lived there. You know the city. \nSAMI I've still got a few legal problems back in the States. \nMarcel glares at him. \nSAMI (nervously) But I'd be... I'd be happy to go. \nMarcel stares at him with hard expression. \nMARCEL If you try to leave town I'll know. If you manage to leave town I'll find you... and the next time we meet in a bathroom I'll be cutting you up into little pieces. \nHe hands Sami a piece of paper. \nMARCEL Be at this address at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. \nINT. CAFE -- MORNING \nDaniel sits with Julien.    At the end of the bar Raymond is on the pay phone. \nQuick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building. Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in... \nEXT. STREET -- MORNING \nAn industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window. \nTAXI DRIVER Are you sure you guys have the right address? This ain't no tourist area. \nMarcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding. \nMARCEL Yes.   We are sure. \nThe taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases. \nSAMI Let me handle this. \nLAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward. \nSAMI Hey, brother.     What's happening, man? \nSami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar. \nLAMAR Don't you brother me, motherfucker. \nSami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air.   He casually lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins. \nLAMAR What's in the bags? \nJULIEN Dirty underwear. \nLamar forces a laugh. \nLAMAR Dirty underwear. That's a good one. Let me explain something to you. This is my street and you're gonna give me want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads open. \nRaymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm. \nRAYMOND Lamar, violence is never an answer to settling disputes. I can see you have a lot of anger... but this is not the way to get it out. \nLAMAR Get outta my face! \nLamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs, chains and pipes. \nLAMAR Now, are you going to give me the suitcases? Or are we going to have to take them? \nZero is still sitting on one of the suitcases. \nZERO Va te faire foutre! \nLAMAR What did he say? \nDANIEL He said to go fuck yourself. \nZERO We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass. \nLAMAR Who is Zero? \nJULIEN He is. \nLAMAR (to Julien) He speaks about himself in the third person? \nJulien shrugs his shoulders. \nLAMAR Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me? \nZERO If you insist. \nZero stands up and raises his hand.   He is holding a .9mm Glock. He aims it at Lamar's head. \nLamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away. Zero aims the gun at his groin. \nZERO Leave now before Zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls. \nLamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building. \nZero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief. \nSAMI You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that? \nZERO Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours. \nZero grins and walks away. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING \nThe crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks.     A peep-hole in the door is opened and an eye looks them over. \nMARCEL We are looking for Sophie.    Laurant send us. \nThe door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's computer). She is late 20's, beautiful. \nVinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito. \nZAMMITO You bleed on me, I'll kill ya. \nVinny takes a step back. \nZAMMITO What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? (to Joey) What'd I say to him? \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" You said don't do it, boss. \nZAMMITO That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate. \nVINNY Frankie, I -- \nZAMMITO -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. (to Joey and Nicky) Break his arm. \nVinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes. \nVINNY Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother! \nZAMMITO That's why we're only breaking one arm. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON \nThe table is littered with plates.   Sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin. \nSOPHIE There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom. \nJULIEN I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem. \nSAMI After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window. \nDANIEL (impressed) Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door. \nJULIEN What about transportation? \nSOPHIE You can use my car. \nDANIEL Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one. \nRAYMOND No problem. \nSAMI When do we go? \nSOPHIE Tonight. \nDANIEL Tonight? \nSOPHIE I know they won't be home tonight. \nSAMI You ever hear of jet lag? \nSOPHIE Take a nap. \nEXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON \nAs they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud MUSIC. \nINT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON \nAs the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint. \nJULIEN What the hell is that? \nWAYNE Neighbors.    They do this all the time. \nSAMI I can't even hear myself think. \nZERO How are we supposed to sleep with this noise? \nSOPHIE I've asked them a hundred times to keep in down. They don't listen. \nRAYMOND I will talk to them. \nSophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing. \nWAYNE Yeah.   Right. \nSOPHIE Not a good idea. \nRAYMOND It's just a matter of communication. \nRaymond leaves. \nEXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON \nRaymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE. Behind him are two other rough-looking men. \nRAYMOND (cheerfully; loudly over the music) Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting next door and I was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud. \nBOBBY BEANS To tell you that we're interested in the property. \nZAMMITO You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table. \nBOBBY BEANS I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano. \nZAMMITO Yeah -- you do that. \nBobby Beans leaves. \nZAMMITO Jerk-wad! \nZammito looks over at Joey and Nicky. \nZAMMITO How's my brother? \nNICKY \"THE RAKE\" He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm. \nZAMMITO I said a clean break. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Hey boss, it's not a science. \nZAMMITO Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards. \nNicky gets up to carry out his instructions. \nZAMMITO Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to his house. I don't want the kids to go hungry while he's recuperating. \nINT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- LATER -- AFTERNOON \nJulien and Zero are playing cards at the back of the room. Sami sitting by himself sorting through a BLACK CANVAS BAG filled with shoes. Sophie joins him. Sami pulls another pair of shoes out of the canvas bag. \nSOPHIE You like shoes? \nSAMI No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. \nSOPHIE It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it. \nSami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag. \nSOPHIE So, how did you get hooked up with these guys? \nSAMI Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's? \nSOPHIE The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information. \nSAMI So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed? \nSOPHIE They're not nice people. \nShe sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm.    It's a heart with someone's faded name. \nSOPHIE I like your tattoo. \nSami is suddenly self-conscious of it.    She traces along the letters with her finger. \nSOPHIE (reading the name) Casandra. Old girlfriend? \nSAMI Something like that. \nSOPHIE Did she break your heart? \nSAMI Something like that. \nSOPHIE It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago? \nSAMI You ask a lot of questions. \nSOPHIE That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it? \nSAMI I don't remember.    I was drunk. \nSOPHIE You got it in a bar? \nSAMI No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy? \nSOPHIE Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry. \nSAMI It's okay.   It was a long time ago. \nSOPHIE I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass. \nSami looks at her quizzically. \nSAMI Who's gonna see it there? \nSOPHIE The lucky ones. \nShe smiles flirtatiously and walks away. \nZammito thinks it over. \nZAMMITO Okay.    I'm coming. \nHe walks over to the MARIO, the OWNER of the restaurant. \nZAMMITO Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives tell her I had an emergency. \nMARIO Of course, Mr. Zammito. \nEXT. WRIGLEY FIELD STADIUM -- NIGHT \nThe Impala is stopped in the parking lot. \nRAYMOND (V.O.) I think we went the wrong way. \nSAMI (V.O.) Oh, you think? \nMARCEL (V.O.) The map said to go left. \nJULIEN (V.O.) Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right. \nMARCEL (V.O.) (amused) Oh yeah. \nINT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- EVENING \nZammito enters to find ANGELO BONANNO, 60's, powerful, head of the Chicago Mob. He is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy. \nBONANNO Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something? \nZAMMITO No, I'm good, Angelo. \nBonanno motions to the couch.    Zammito sits down. \nBONANNO I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today. \nZAMMITO Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse. \nBONANNO And? \nZAMMITO And nothing.     He's just feeling us out. \nBONANNO He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. \nZAMMITO He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off. \nBONANNO Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property. \nZAMMITO I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary. \nBonanno stares at him. \nBONANNO They're gonna be what? \nZAMMITO Supernumerary. It means better than expected. \nBONANNO Good word. \nHalf Tooth Tony, 30's, built like a tank step into the room. He has the face of a boxer, several of his teeth are chipped or broken. \nHALF TOOTH TONY Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to remind you that you have an appointment in ten minutes. \nHalf Tooth Tony leaves. \nZAMMITO Someone else coming? \nBONANNO Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? \nZAMMITO Uh, no -- \nBONANNO You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me. \nZAMMITO You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you. \nBonanno affectionately slaps Zammito's cheeks. \nBONANNO Go.   Rest. \nBonanno takes a sip of his brandy, but his eyes stay on Zammito. \nBONANNO Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother? \nZAMMITO He missed three weeks. \nBONANNO Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it? \nZAMMITO I did. Joey \"Two Tons\" and Nicky \"The Rake\" did the deed. \nBONANNO But you were there? \nFBI AGENT Should I call C.P.D.? \nAGENT HADLEY Yeah, but tell them not to move until these morons come out of the house. \nINT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nBLACK SCREEN. From inside the safe we see Julien open the door. Daniel and Julien look inside. There are a several stacks of cash, envelopes and a small cardboard box. Julien starts removing everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag. \nJULIEN Where are the jewels?   There aren't any jewels. \nMarcel looks as surprised as they are. \nMARCEL There has to be. \nJULIEN I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels. \nMARCEL There must be half a million dollars here though. \nDANIEL Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember? Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO... \nWe can see the color drain from Sami's face. He glances over at Zammito whose eyes are locked on his. Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel and pulls them aside. \nSAMI (babbling nervously) We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- (flatly) Do you know who that is? \nMARCEL Mr. Taylor? \nSAMI No, that's not Mr. Taylor. \nDANIEL (sensing something bad is coming) It's not? \nSAMI That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia. \nMARCEL (confused) Why would they want us to rob the Mafia? \nSAMI (screaming) \nWE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN' \nIDIOT! \nA beat. The three of them turn and look at Zammito. The seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel. He moves over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth. \nMARCEL Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a big mistake here. May I use your phone? \nZAMMITO Feel free. \nMarcel picks up the cordless phone and dials. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. BASTALDI'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nBastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone. \nBASTALDI Hello? \nMARCEL (V.O.) (in French) It's Elvis... \nBASTALDI Who? \nMARCEL (V.O.) (in French) It's me... \nBASTALDI Marcel? \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nMarcel continues his conversation. \nMARCEL (in French) Yes. (More) \nMARCEL (Cont'd) We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. \nBASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) You're there now? \nMARCEL Oui. \nBASTALDI (in French) You're calling me on your cell phone, right? \nMARCEL No. \nBASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) You're calling me on is phone? \nMARCEL Oui. \nBASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) My number's going to show up on his bill! \nMARCEL (In French) Should I call you back? \nJULIEN Bastaldi got the address from you, yes? \nSOPHIE Yes. \nJULIEN And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road. \nSOPHIE No.    145 Ridgeroad Way. \nDANIEL That moron. \nMARCEL It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road. \nDANIEL Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning. \nINT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT \nAgent Hadley checks his watch. \nAGENT HADLEY What the hell are they doing in there? \nFBI AGENT Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the units here any longer. They want to know if they should go in? \nAgent Hadley thinks a moment. \nAGENT HADLEY Tell them no.     We'll advise if anything changes. \nINT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nZammito is still tied to his chair. HIS POV -- of the cordless phone of his bed. He pushes with his feet, sliding the chair over to the bed, then starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward, his face pressed against the mattress. Using his nose he turns on the phone and presses a speed dial number. \nINT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nJoey \"Two Tons\" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt. Next to him is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep mask. The phone rings. Joey answers it. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Yeah? \nWe hear Zammito's muffled cries for help. It almost sounds like someone moaning during a sexual act. Joey is surprised at first, then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep. He slides his hand under the covers and closes his eyes. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" (quietly) Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh \nINT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nZammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the other end of the line. He grimaces, then shouts louder. \nINT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nJoey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" That's right baby, give it to papa Joey. \nHe is really deep into his fantasy world when... \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" WIFE Joey, who is that? \nJoey sits up quickly. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" (loudly; for his wife's sake) -- And don't call here again, you pervert. \nHe slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's house. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Yeah boss? \nAgain we hear the same muffled cries. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Boss? \nINT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT \nRaphael enters with Hector and two GANG-BANGERS.   The room is filled with low rider cars. \nWorking under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine. \nRAPHAEL Someone stole my car tonight! \nFELIX C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I would steal your car? \nRAPHAEL You run a chop shop for low riders. Yes, I think you'd steal my car. \nRaphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again. \nFELIX I swear I didn't. I wouldn't! \nRAPHAEL And I should just believe-- \nHECTOR (overlapping; to Felix) -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car. \nRAPHAEL (to Hector) Hector, don't interrupt me. \nHECTOR He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car. \nShe stares at them defiantly. \nSAMI Who are you waiting for? \nSOPHIE Stick around and find out. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING \nA knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door. Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of Zero's gun pressed against his head. \nHadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He opens it and sees his FBI identification. \nZERO He's FBI. \nZero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami. \nRAYMOND What is she doing with an agent du FBI? \nSami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag.    Slowly it starts to come together in his mind. \nSAMI We've been set up. \nHe stares at Sophie angrily. \nSAMI We didn't go to the wrong house. We went to right one, didn't we Sophie? \nHer expression gives away nothing. \nSAMI They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? (beat) Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us. \nZERO What does arresting us get them? \nSAMI (to Hadley) You wanna tell him? \nAGENT HADLEY You're telling it fine. \nDaniel motions to Zero. \nDANIEL You see my friend over there? I nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee. \nZero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go ahead. \nAGENT HADLEY You wouldn't. \nDaniel nods.   Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap. \nAGENT HADLEY That's going to make a lot of noise. Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger. \nThey know he's right. \nSAMI He's got a point. \nSami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams. Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand. \nAGENT HADLEY Okay! Okay! We've been investigating Zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house. We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out. \nDANIEL We know all this. \nAGENT HADLEY You just don't take out a boss. You need permission from the other families to do something like that. Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved. Look at these tapes. The guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years. \nDANIEL So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him. \nAgent Hadley nods. \nSAMI (to Sophie) What are you getting out of this? \nThere is no point in hiding anything now. \nSOPHIE Money.

And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya? \nDANIEL I'm from Belgium. \nLAMAR Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you. \nDANIEL Why haven't you turned us in? \nLAMAR I ain't no rat. (beat) You got money, right? \nDaniel nods. \nLAMAR And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee. \nDANIEL How much? \nLAMAR A thousand dollars? \nDANIEL Fine. \nDaniel hands him his cell phone. \nDANIEL Take this. I'll call you in a few hours. You tell me where we meet. \nINT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nWayne is on the couch watching TV. There is a loud knock on the door. He opens the door to find Agent Hadley. \nWAYNE Yeah? \nHadley pushes past Wayne and enters. \nWAYNE Hey dude, what do you think you're doing? \nHadley flashes his badge. \nWAYNE Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something? \nAGENT HADLEY Not today.   Where are your friends? \nWAYNE They left about a half hour ago. \nAGENT HADLEY Where did they go? \nWAYNE I dunno. \nHadley punches Wayne in the face.    Wayne falls to the floor. \nWAYNE Hey man, you can't do that! \nAGENT HADLEY What?   This? \nAgent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest. \nAGENT HADLEY Or this? \nAgent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs. \nWAYNE Jesus.

So tell me, where did they go? \nWAYNE I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. (points to coffee table) All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris. \nHadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table. He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs. \nZammito grimaces as the news of the robbery becomes public. \nZAMMITO Oh, shit! \nCLOSE ON TELEVISION The Reporter continues. \nREPORTER The other members of his gang are reported to be French nationals Daniel Foray, Marcel Burot, Julien Labesse... \nPull back again... \nINT.

Care to elaborate? \nSami gets into Julien's face. \nSAMI You're not helping. \nRAYMOND Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us. \nJULIEN Oh, Jesus.    We're dead. \nJulien walks away.    Daniel picks up the phone and dials a number. \nINT. LAMAR'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME \nThe cell phone Daniel gave him rings.      He answers it. \nLAMAR Yeah? \nDANIEL (V.O.) It's me. \nLAMAR Hey you guys are becoming famous.

Lamar grins, happy with the money he's going to make. \nINT.

He knows the answer before he asks the question. \nDANIEL Julien? Raymond's face fills with sadness.   He shakes his. \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE-- LATER -- DUSK \nThere is a cold silence in the room. Daniel stares at the sliding glass door, staring out over the city. \nSAMI It's not your fault, Daniel. \nDANIEL No? \nHe looks at them sadly. \nDANIEL We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house. \nMARCEL We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up. \nDANIEL I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi. \nSAMI I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him. \nRaphael and Hector exit.    We move with them through the door into... \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING \nRaphael and Hector head for the front door. The elevator doors opens and Sami exits. They walk past each other as Sami heads across the lobby and into the gift shop. As Raphael and Hector walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them. He goes over to a WOMAN CLERK at the front desk. \nAGENT HADLEY I'd like to see the manager please. \nShe walks over to the HOTEL MANAGER and points to Agent Hadley. The Manager walks over. \nHOTEL MANAGER May I help you? \nAgent Hadley shows him his badge. \nAGENT HADLEY I'm looking for several French men who checked in within the last twenty four hours. \nHOTEL MANAGER They checked in last night. \nAGENT HADLEY I need you to take me to their room. \nAgent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators and pass... Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his face so Hadley will not see him. Sami walks quickly across the lobby and passes... \nJoey \"Two Tons\", Nicky \"The Rake\" and three other WISEGUYS enter the hotel. Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager. The doors close as the wiseguys approach. \nThe moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside. \nMAN Excuse me.   I was here first. \nSami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer. The phone just rings and rings. Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter. Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring.    The Man who Sami pushed away is still there. \nMAN Hey buddy, you just can't push in here. \nSAMI Go away. \nMAN I most certainly will not go-- \nSami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver.

We're leaving! \nRAYMOND Why do I have to pick up the tapes. \nDANIEL Jesus! \nDaniel grabs the canvas bag. \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING \nThe manager is about to open the door with his key.   Agent Hadley takes it and removes a gun. \nAGENT HADLEY You should go now. \nThe manager runs away.

AGENT HADLEY'S POV -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head. \nDANIEL I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery. \nBONANNO (seething) I don't think it will be a mystery much longer. \nDANIEL He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years. \nBONANNO I assume you want something? \nDANIEL We've got a lot of people looking for us.

I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word. \nBONANNO Where are you staying? \nDaniel grins.   He isn't going to tell him. \nBONANNO I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made. \nDANIEL How about if I call you? \nINT. COTTAGE -- MORNING \nZero and Raymond are sleeping. We hear the shower running in the bathroom. Sami is at the table. The black canvas bag containing the tapes is on the table.

COZY COURTS -- MORNING \nSami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone and dials. A taxi pulls up. \nSAMI Same place.    One hour. \nSami gets in the taxi and it drives away.

Did you bring the tapes? \nSami holds up the canvas bag. \nSAMI The lamp? \nHadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base. Sami hands him the canvas bag. \nAGENT HADLEY Just a second. You must think I'm a real moron. \nHadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks a tape and inserts it into the player. \nZAMMITO'S VOICE I just came by to tell that \"piece of work\" you asked for on Johnny Wicks -- It's done. \nBONANNO'S VOICE Good.   How'd he go? \nZAMMITO'S VOICE Like the crying rat bastard that he was. \nHadley stops the tape.   He inserts another one. \nZAMMITO'S VOICE Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy. He's a congressman. \nBONANNO'S VOICE I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We pay him each month to look after our interests. \nHadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami. \nAGENT HADLEY Here you go, sport. \nSami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops out with two of his friends. All of them have guns. \nLAMAR I'll take the bag. \nAGENT HADLEY You don't think I see through this?     You tell Sami he's dead. \nRAYMOND Mr. Zammito? \nVINNY Uh huh. \nRAYMOND I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother. \nVINNY I don't know what you're talking about. \nRAYMOND I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you. \nVINNY How? \nRAYMOND You see that car? \nVinny looks on the street and sees the Impala. \nVINNY Yeah. \nRAYMOND It's yours. A gift.

Bastaldi looks around, but there is no sign of them. \nA DIFFERENT ANGLE We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car.

They are all amused with Bastaldi's bewilderment. \nRAYMOND What's he doing? \nMARCEL He's looking around for us. \nZERO Zero can't stay like this much longer.

Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television. \nJULIEN Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days. \nRAYMOND She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare. \nA thought occurs to Sami. \nSAMI Not everything. \nHe removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before Sophie entered. \nSAMI I was going to listen to it last night but I -- \nHe realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened. \nSAMI -- feel asleep. \nWayne blurts out a sloppy laugh. \nWAYNE No you didn't, dude. You were bangin' Sophie. I saw you guys going at it. \nDANIEL You slept with her? \nSAMI Well, actually I would say she slept with me. \nDaniel stares at him angrily. \nSAMI What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something. \nDANIEL You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you? \nSAMI No.   Chicks dig me. \nDaniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player.   On the tape we hear a phone ringing. \nMAN'S VOICE Hello? \nZAMMITO'S VOICE It's me. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move. \nMAN'S VOICE We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here. We're talking about a boss. \nSami is the first to realize what he is hearing. \nSAMI Holy shit. \nRAYMOND What? \nSami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest. \nZAMMITO'S VOICE Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your support? \nA pause on the line. \nMAN'S VOICE Yeah. \nThe line goes dead.    Sami leans back. \nSAMI No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family. \nJULIEN This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war. \nMARCEL The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is. \nDANIEL You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you. \nJULIEN I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, \"don't do it! Don't you do it!\" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself? \n", "test1_true": "MARCEL What are you guys so scared of? Zammito doesn't know who we are. We just get out of town and it's over. \nZERO Oh, you think it's that easy? \nRAYMOND Yeah.   We just go home. \nDANIEL We can't. \nRAYMOND I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane. \nSAMI They'll be waiting for us at the airport. \nDANIEL You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us. \nSAMI We have to find Sophie. \nRAYMOND How are we going to do that? \nWAYNE I know where she went. \nThey all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint. \nWAYNE I heard her talking on the phone. Bay View Motel. It's about five blocks from here. \nEXT. STREET -- MORNING \nA beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing from the tail pipe. \nINT. PINTO -- MOVING -- MORNING \nRaphael is at the wheel, his eyes scanning the street for his car. In the passenger seat Hector sits calmly. They come to a red light and stop. RAPHAEL'S POV -- Across the street is low rider car. \nRaphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car. ON HECTOR. We see the Impala pull up beside them.       Raymond is driving. Daniel, Sami and Zero are with him. Hector glances over and sees the Impala. Raymond smiles at him and nods. Hector slowly nods back. He looks over at Raphael who is still looking out the window. The light turns green. The Impala turns right.     Raphael looks over at a confused Hector. \nRAPHAEL Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car? \nHECTOR Hard to say. \nEXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING \nA motel like any other.   Sami stands outside the office with Daniel, Raymond and Zero. \nRAYMOND How do we know what room she's in? \nSAMI Wait here. \nINT. OFFICE -- BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING \nSami enters.   Behind the counter is the MOTEL CLERK, middle-aged, balding. \nSAMI Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's about five six. Pretty. Dark hair. \nMOTEL CLERK I can't give out information on our guests. \nSAMI C'mon man, I think she's having an affair. \nMOTEL CLERK So are half the people in this place.    I can't help you, pal. \nSami nods and walks outside. Through the window we see him talking with the others. A beat. Sami steps back inside with Zero. \nMOTEL CLERK Look, I can't tell you -- Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged under the clerks jaw. \nMOTEL CLERK Room fourteen. \nZERO Thank you. \nEXT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING \nSami knocks. The others stand off to the side of the door. Sophie opens the door and sees Sami. Before she can slam it he pushes it open. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING \nSami pushes her onto the bed. \nSAMI I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be. \nSOPHIE After last night I could say the same for you. \nSami feigns a smile. Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is alone. He looks at Daniel and shake his head. Raymond finds the black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents. \nRAYMOND The money isn't here. \nSAMI Where is it, Sophie? \nSOPHIE I don't know. \nDANIEL If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again. \n", "test1_id": 855, "test2_input": "Looks even worse on the inside. A dark corridor is lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. An old PROSTITUTE walks past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun glasses, his neck draped in gold chains. \nBLACK GUY (very loud) I'm gonna have to search you. \nDANIEL We'll save you the trouble. \nDaniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley in his waistband. \nBLACK GUY (loudly) You can't come in here with that. \nDaniel looks past him to Ellwood. \nDANIEL What's wrong with this guy? \nELLWOOD He's my cousin. He's deaf. \nDaniel removes an envelope full of cash. \nDANIEL We're here to buy, not steal. If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem. \nEllwood stomps his foot several times on the floor.   The black guy feels the vibration and turns around. \nELLWOOD Let them in. \nThe black guy steps aside.   Daniel and Zero enter. \nINT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING \nEllwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons. \nELLWOOD What can I do you for? \nDaniel looks over the merchandise. \nDANIEL How much for the nines? \nELLWOOD A grand a piece. \nDANIEL I'll need extra clips and ammo. \nDaniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them. \nLAMAR What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I gave them my word. \nELLWOOD Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys. You think I'm going to settle for four G's when I can make forty? (to Daniel) All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor. \nDaniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed. \nELLWOOD I said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed. \nEllwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips. \nELLWOOD Get that and add it to my inventory. \nThe black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero. \nELLWOOD I assume you're carrying too? \nZero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm. \nELLWOOD Okay, put it on the floor... and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed. \nZERO (flatly) No. \nHe stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes. \nELLWOOD No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't. Nobody is that fast. \nZERO Zero is. \nELLWOOD Who's Zero? \nLAMAR He is. \nEllwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's forehead. \nEllwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them. \nA beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room. \nBLACK GUY Found it! \nEXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING \nDaniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope. \nDANIEL There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do. \nLAMAR What? \n", "test2_true": "In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black guy as he finds Ellwood's body. \nINT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY \nRaymond and Julien approach the counter.   Raymond is nervous. \nRAYMOND (in French) I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar. \nJULIEN (in French) Relax. It will be fine. \nThey arrive at the counter. The RENTAL AGENT, a man in his 30's looks up at them with a smile. \nCAR RENTAL AGENT Hello. \nRAYMOND Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton, Ohio and I would like to rent a car with my visa gold card. \nRaymond smiles, a big, friendly, completely over exaggerated smile. Julien looks at him and rolls his eyes. The Rental Agent walks down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone. \nCAR RENTAL AGENT (into phone) I got a couple French guys here trying to rent a car. (listens) Sure. I can stall them. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY \nVinny is in bed, his arm in a cast and sling. His wife ANGIE, 30's, big hair, loud clothes. She sits on the bed feeding him. His two kids, RICHIE, 8, and TOMMY 10, sit off to the side. Zammito enters. \nZAMMITO Angie, how you doin'? \nShe kisses him. Vinny stares blankly at his brother. Zammito takes a step back, looks her up and down. He lays on the charm. \nZAMMITO Hey, you're looking good. There's something different about you. You get a boob job or something? \nANGIE I've gained weight. \nZAMMITO Yeah, well, it suits you. \nZammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello. \nZAMMITO Hey Tommy. \nRICHIE I'm Richie.    He's Tommy. \nZAMMITO Whatever. \nZammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and peels one off. \nZAMMITO Angie, take the kids down to the gift shop and buy 'em something. I need a word with Vinny. \nAngie looks at the money. \nANGIE (flatly) Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we buy? \nShe takes the kids and leaves. \nZAMMITO She seems pleasant enough. \nVINNY She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs. \nZAMMITO That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does. \nZammito sits on the edge of the bed. \nZAMMITO So, I just come by to see how you're doin'? \nVINNY You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'? \nZAMMITO Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay? \nVINNY Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie? \nZAMMITO I don't want anything. (More) \nZAMMITO (Cont'd) I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day. \nVINNY A little? \nZAMMITO Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you. \nVINNY You gonna forget about the money I owe you? \nZAMMITO What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that. \nZammito's cell phone rings. \nZAMMITO (into phone) Yeah? (his face hardens) I'm on my way. \nZammito hangs up. \nZAMMITO I got something I gotta do. I'm glad we had this talk. Heal. Get better. Let me know when you're ready to start. \n", "test2_id": 856, "test3_input": "Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes. Marcel is in the kitchenette. \nDANIEL (to Zero) When we get back to Paris I'll take you dancing. \nZero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it on the counter. \nDANIEL Bring me the scissors. \nZERO And the Vodka. \nSami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls. \nDANIEL Cut his pants up the leg to the groin. \nZERO And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one. \nHe winks at Sami. \nSAMI What's he joking around for?    He's been shot. \nDANIEL He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it. \nRaymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes some white bread. \nSAMI Anybody hungry? \nDANIEL What'd you get? \nSAMI Some bread and... \nHe removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread. \nSAMI Cheese. \nAll the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet. \nDANIEL Cheese?   In a can? \nSami stuffs his mouth with a big bite. \nSAMI It's good. \nMARCEL God, I want to go home. \nSAMI Hey, you know you can't this in France. \nDANIEL Thank God. \nDaniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen. \nDANIEL (to Zero) Ready? \nZero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His face contorts violently from the pain. \nINT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING \nZammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta. DEAN MARTIN \"Innamaraia\" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience. Joey \"Two Tons\" and Nicky \"The Rake\" enter. Their faces tell the story. \nZAMMITO What happened? \nNICKY \"THE RAKE\" They sort of got away. \nZAMMITO I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I \"sort of\" kill you. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss. \nZAMMITO Oh, I'm sorry. \nZammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him. \nZAMMITO Had enough? \nJoey \"Two Tons\" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him. \nZAMMITO Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead. \nThey turn around and leave.       Zammito stares after them angrily. \nZAMMITO Cafones! \nHe looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table. \nZAMMITO You gonna bring that over here today, or what? \nINT. COTTAGE -- MORNING \nZero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand. The others have been up all night. Raymond is across the table from Sami. \nRAYMOND The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine? \n", "test3_true": "RAYMOND \nJ&B? \nSAMI Glenmorangie. \nRAYMOND Glenmorangie is very good. \nSami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something... anything... that will get his mind of the events that have lead them here. \nSAMI But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back. \nRaymond forces a weak smile. Daniel who has been watching them grabs a few things off the table. \nDANIEL I'll be back in an hour. \nDaniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside. \nEXT. COTTAGE -- MORNING \nSami steps outside.   Daniel is staring at him. \nSAMI What? \nDANIEL Can I trust you, Sami? \nSAMI Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room? \nDANIEL If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing. \nSAMI No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. \nDANIEL You haven't answered my question. \nSAMI Does it really matter what I say? \nDANIEL I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today. \nSAMI I will. \nDANIEL You better. \nEXT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- MORNING \nDaniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell.   Half Tooth Tony opens the door and looks him up and down. \nHALF TOOTH TONY Yeah? \nDANIEL I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please. \nHALF TOOTH TONY Who the hell are you? \nDANIEL Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie Zammito. \nINT. BONANNO'S FOYER -- MORNING \nHalf Tooth Tony searches Daniel. He finds a small cassette player, glances at it and sticks it back in Daniel's pocket. \nHALF TOOTH TONY (points to a door) In there. \nINT. BONANNO'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING \nDaniel enters. Half Tooth Tony stands behind him, his eyes locked on Daniel's every move. Bonanno is sitting in an armchair. \nBONANNO Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it? \nDANIEL I guess we're going to find out. \nBONANNO You rob an associate of mine... a friend and-- \nDANIEL (overlapping) Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket? \nBonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony. \nHALF TOOTH TONY He's clean. \nBonanno nods.   Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on. \nZAMMITO'S VOICE Of course. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move. \nMAN'S VOICE We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here Frankie. We're talking about a boss. \nZAMMITO'S VOICE Bonanno's a dinosaur.

{"test1_input": "Daniel is still staring at the closet. \nBASTALDI Hey Daniel! Hello? (snaps his fingers) Do you guys speak English? \nDANIEL Uh, yeah. \nBASTALDI Good.   I have a job for you in America. \nBastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck. \nBASTALDI The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom. \nJULIEN It seems like a long way to go for a necklace. \nDANIEL Besides, we don't know the city and-- \nMARCEL (overlapping) Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. (More) \nMARCEL (Cont'd) He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go! \nBASTALDI Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation. \nDANIEL C'mon, Laurant, America? \nBASTALDI The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow. \nThey know they don't have a choice. \nJULIEN We're going to need to find someone who knows the city. \nMARCEL I know someone. \nEXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY \nThe plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a \"I Love Paris\" tee-shirt. He passes a MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets. He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees... \nHIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving towards him . He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd. \nINT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY \nSami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile. NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted. \nMARCEL Going somewhere? \nSAMI Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run. \nA long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him. \nSAMI You're probably here for the money I owe you. (off Marcel's nod) I don't have it. Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside. \nINT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nMarcel closes the door.   He is face to face with Sami. \nSAMI You know this is how rumors get started. \nMarcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act. \nSAMI Told you. \nMarcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet. \nMARCEL Today's your lucky day, Sami. \nSAMI (breathlessly) Yeah, I can see that. \nMARCEL Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them. \nSAMI Me? \nMARCEL You lived there. You know the city. \nSAMI I've still got a few legal problems back in the States. \nMarcel glares at him. \nSAMI (nervously) But I'd be... I'd be happy to go. \nMarcel stares at him with hard expression. \nMARCEL If you try to leave town I'll know. If you manage to leave town I'll find you... and the next time we meet in a bathroom I'll be cutting you up into little pieces. \nHe hands Sami a piece of paper. \nMARCEL Be at this address at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. \nINT. CAFE -- MORNING \nDaniel sits with Julien.    At the end of the bar Raymond is on the pay phone. \n", "test1_true": "Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien. \nSAMI I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me. \nJULIEN What is it you do, Sami? \nSAMI You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing. \nJULIEN I see.   A master criminal. \nSAMI Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave. \nThe door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is 40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over. \nDANIEL (to Sami) This is Zero. \nSAMI Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five. \nSami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and leads him away from the others. \nJULIEN Let me give you some advice. You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it. What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you. \nZERO (in French) So, we are going to America? \nDANIEL In English.   Sami doesn't speak French. \nZERO Where are you from? \nSAMI Algeria. \nZERO And you don't speak French? \nSAMI Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really -- \nZERO (overlapping) -- Zero isn't interested in your life story. (to Daniel) Who gets killed? \nDANIEL Hopefully no one. \nZERO (confused) No one? Then why is Zero here? \nSami leans over to Raymond. \nSAMI He speaks about himself in the third person? \nRAYMOND Feel free to correct him if you want. \nDANIEL (to Zero) I just want you there in case there's trouble. \nZERO And if there is, then Zero can kill someone? \nDANIEL We'll see. \nEXT. CAFE -- DAY \nDaniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH. \nBASTALDI (to Daniel) I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you. \nDANIEL What? \nBASTALDI This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you. \nDANIEL You don't trust me? \nBASTALDI I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment. \nINT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY \nFor many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the air conditioner. \nZero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to RENAUD singing \"Des que le vent souffera.\" He leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, \"Que je taime.\" \nMARCEL That's better. \nZero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday. Bastaldi has had enough. \nBASTALDI Stop it!   Both of you! \nHe turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but loud enough for Zero to hear. \nMARCEL (singing) ... que je t'aime... que je... Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops. \nEXT. O'HARE AIRPORT -- MORNING \nDaniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi. \nEXT. CHICAGO DRIVING MONTAGE -- MORNING \n", "test1_id": 855, "test2_input": "Julien concentrates as he weaves the car in and out of the on coming traffic. \nRAYMOND (in French) I knew I should have driven. \nJULIEN (in French) Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nThe oncoming traffic veers off. Cars collide. The Lincoln clips a car, loses control for a moment, then continues after them. At the corner the Cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic in the right direction. \nEXT. FRANKLIN STREET -- DAY \nThe Lincoln moves up along side the Cadillac. Two WISEGUYS lean out the window with guns in their hands. The Cadillac veers away just as they start shooting. Bullets riddle the car. \nINT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY \nRaymond removes Hadley's backup gun. The Lincoln pulls up beside them again. The sound of GUN FIRE fills the air as Raymond shoots from the Cadillac. The rear passenger window of the Lincoln shatters and Raymond fires. The Lincoln drops back. \nEXT. HUBBARD STREET -- DAY \nThe Cadillac turns the corner. The Lincoln follows. The traffic is heavier here. The cars have to slow down. The Lincoln moves beside them again. Raymond fires his last shot. His gun his now empty. Several rounds of gun fire come from the Lincoln. \nINT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY \nRaymond looks over to Julien. \nRAYMOND (in French) What are we going to -- His voice trails off as he sees Julien. A bullet has glanced his neck, not deep, but deep enough to sever an artery. Blood pours down his neck and covers his shirt. His face is pale. He glances at the wound in the rear view mirror. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nJulien steers the caddy onto another street.   The towncar follows. \nINT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY \nJulien looks at Raymond. He is paler now, his shirt completely covered with blood. He strains to stay conscious. \nJULIEN (in French) When we get to the next corner jump out. \nRAYMOND (in French) I'm not going to leave you. \nJULIEN (in French) We both know I'm already dead. \nRaymond knows he's right.   The car races into the next turn. \nJULIEN (in French) Go! Raymond opens the door. He jumps out. \nINT. LINCOLN - DRIVER'S POV -- DAY \nOf Raymond as he rolls towards the curb.    The Caddy skids around the corner. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nThe Lincoln slams on it's brakes in the middle of an intersection. Raymond is dazed from his fall. He gets up slowly, his pants torn and sees.. \nP.O.V. RAYMOND OF THE TOWNCAR -- DAY The driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and is just about to shoot when... \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nJulien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes into the Lincoln. The impact sends the Lincoln spinning around. When it stops the driver's window is facing the front of the caddy. The driver of the caddy takes aim and fires.   The bullet goes through the windshield and kills Julien. The driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see... \nP.O.V. A LARGE TRUCK -- DAY Speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the Lincoln. It crumbles like a toy under the weight. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nRaymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic. He stares sadly at Julien. \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- AFTERNOON \nZero and Marcel are checking over the guns. Daniel writes some notes on a pad of paper. Sami appears nervous as he sits off to the side. The door opens. Raymond limps into the room. His face is dirty, bruised, his pants torn, legs scraped. He stands there, staring at them through empty eyes. Daniel looks at the door expectantly.   He knows the answer before he asks the question. \nDANIEL Julien? Raymond's face fills with sadness.   He shakes his. \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE-- LATER -- DUSK \nThere is a cold silence in the room. Daniel stares at the sliding glass door, staring out over the city. \nSAMI It's not your fault, Daniel. \nDANIEL No? \nHe looks at them sadly. \nDANIEL We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house. \nMARCEL We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up. \nDANIEL I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi. \nSAMI I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him. \n", "test2_true": "MARCEL No.   How much? \nRAYMOND I don't know.     It's gotta be millions. \nDANIEL We still have to get out of here. \nMARCEL Maybe if we gave the tapes back -- \nZERO (strongly) No. \nEveryone looks to Zero. \nZERO They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key. \nSAMI He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi. \nINT. AGENT HADLEY'S APARTMENT -- EVENING \nAgent Hadley sits on his couch, deep in thought. He glances at the paper with Raymond's phone number on the coffee table. A beat. He gets an idea. He picks up his phone and dials. \nAGENT HADLEY Hello? Mrs. Gayet? Do you speak English? (listens) You do. Great. (listens) Oh, you taught Raymond English. You did a wonderful job. I'm sorry to call so late but I'm supposed to meet Raymond -- (listens) No, I didn't know he was a difficult child.

I wondering if you -- (listens) The Holiday Hotel. Room 912. Thank you very much. \nEXT. HUBBARD STREET -- EVENING \nTow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars. Only a few POLICE CARS are there. \nA UNIFORMED COP looks over and sees Joey \"Two Tons\" on the sidewalk. Joey motions with his head to an alley. \nEXT. ALLEY -- EVENING \nThe Uniformed Cop enters the alley and joins Joey. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" What'd you guys find? \nUNIFORMED COP Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" And the other car? \nUNIFORMED COP Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Are you forgetting who supplements your income? \nUNIFORMED COP No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this? \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found? \nUNIFORMED COP A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash. \nThis sparks Joey's interest. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" What hotel? \nUNIFORMED COP The Holiday Hotel. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" What room number? \nUNIFORMED COP I don't know.     I didn't look. \nJOEY \"TWO TONS\" Go look. \nINT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING \nThe crew sits around a table trying to figure out how they can get out of town. \nDANIEL Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond. \nSAMI Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs. \nMARCEL How about Canada? \nRAYMOND What are we going to do, take a taxi? \nSami opens a pack of cigarettes to find it's empty. \nSAMI I'm going to get some cigarettes. \nINT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING \nBecause of the early hour the room is empty. Raphael and Hector are with FREDDY O, 30's, hard-looking.

If they try to move it I can find out. \nRAPHAEL Thanks. \n", "test2_id": 856, "test3_input": "RAYMOND Mr. Zammito? \nVINNY Uh huh. \nRAYMOND I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother. \nVINNY I don't know what you're talking about. \nRAYMOND I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you. \nVINNY How? \nRAYMOND You see that car? \nVinny looks on the street and sees the Impala. \nVINNY Yeah. \nRAYMOND It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment. \nVINNY No shit? \nRAYMOND The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow. \nEXT.   MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nAn old building, dirty windows and peeling paint.       The main door is open. \nINT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nZammito and Joey \"Two Tons\" are standing next to Zammito's Lincoln. Hadley parks ten yards away and gets out with the black canvas bag. \nZAMMITO Those the tapes? \nHadley starts to place the canvas bag on the hood of Zammito's car. \nZAMMITO Watch the paint. \nHadley opens the bag.     It is filled with cassette tapes. \nAGENT HADLEY The money? \nZammito nods to Joey \"Two Tons\" who opens another briefcase filled with cash. \nZAMMITO How'd you get these? \nAGENT HADLEY I got 'em.

Suddenly we hear Wayne Newton singing \"Danke Schoen.\" \nWAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen. Thank you for all the joy and pain... \nHadley's face turns white.     He produces an audible gulp as he looks at Zammito weakly. \nEXT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nThe music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building. \nWAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE Pictures show, second balcony, was the place we'd meet... \nThrough the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills with gunfire. \nWAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE ... second seat, go Dutch treat, you were so sweet... \nZammito's Lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the street. \nINT.

Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a stop. The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino on the jukebox. Zammito stands up. \nRAPHAEL Anybody know about that car outside? \nZAMMITO Yeah.   It's mine. \nRAPHAEL No.   It's mine. \nZAMMITO The hell it is. \nRAPHAEL I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it! \nZAMMITO And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here. \nRAPHAEL Fuck you, grease-ball! \nZAMMITO Fuck me?   Fuck you! \nThey are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to see who's going to make the first move. The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing \"Amore Scusami\". \nSERIES OF QUICK CUTS --   Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's --   A Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side. --   A Wiseguy bites his lip. --   Nicky \"The Rake\" twitches his fingers nervously. --   Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey \"Two Tons\". \nAt the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking. He knocks over a bottle. It falls to the floor and breaks. The noise is enough to push things over the edge. \nJERRY VALE'S VOICE My love, forgive me... \nRaphael goes for his gun.   All hell breaks loose! People dive for cover as shots rings out.   In the close quarters it's like shooting fish in a barrel. \nJERRY VALE'S VOICE I didn't mean to have it end like this... \nEddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang member. Another gang member kills him. It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is quiet. \nJERRY VALE'S VOICE I didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me... \nWe move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey \"Two Tons\" and Nicky \"The Rake\" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar. He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and makes his way to the front door. \nEXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON \n", "test3_id": 857}

He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed. 
92     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      92 
Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire. 
The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon. A smile crosses his face. 
BLAIN (whispers) Come on in you fuckers...come on in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'... 
The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's finger moves closer to the trigger. 
Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves, startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He stands...

SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting. He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to fire... 
...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an EXPLOSION of BLOOD. 
93     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        93 
Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush. He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND. Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a hallucination. 
The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green before they vanish. 
Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest open, the powerful man, dead. 
MAC (shouting) Contact, 30 Right!!! 
He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming into the weapon from the magazine at his waist, expending it in one LONG BURST. 
94     EXT. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                     94 
Flying through the jungle, weapons ready, eyes searching for movement. 
95     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        95 
He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between them. 
He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed, mowing down the jungle. 
The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing with Mac.

Ramirez opens FIRE with the SIX-SHOOTER grenade launcher...EXPLOSIONS rock the jungle. 
96     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                     96 
Moving.  A piece of SHRAPNEL cuts his shoulder.  A splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the surrounding foliage. 
97     BACK TO SCENE/MAC                                     97 
More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the trigger. 
Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS. The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading, searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit, ready to fire again at any second. 
Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle, still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber and barrel. 
Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac. 
MAC (confused) I...saw it. 
At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             * slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         * Mac.  He turns back. 
SCHAEFER You saw what?

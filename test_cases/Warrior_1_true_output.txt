COLT BOYD You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy. 
TOMMY Sure, no problem. 
COLT BOYD Come on in. 
Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring. 
A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves. He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off. 
MAD DOG Gonna be a hero? Alright. 
He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and Colt Boyd. 
Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring. Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face. 
Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away. 
Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS. 
SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and approaches him. 
TOMMY You owe me two hundred bucks. 
INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY 
Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR (40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents. 
DAN TAYLOR This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon. 
BRENDAN Brendan. 
DAN TAYLOR The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that. 
BRENDAN I teach Physics. 
DAN TAYLOR Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage-- 
BRENDAN You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure-- 
DAN TAYLOR Well, you've already refinanced twice. 
BRENDAN Because you advised us to do that. 
DAN TAYLOR I presented you with that option. It was your choice. (BEAT) I'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi. 
BRENDAN We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file? 
Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember. 
DAN TAYLOR Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's...kidney? 
BRENDAN Heart. 
DAN TAYLOR Heart, right. (off stack of files on desk) Lot of stories. 
Brendan glares at him. 
BRENDAN So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me? 
DAN TAYLOR I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even-- 
BRENDAN 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest? 
DAN TAYLOR Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days.

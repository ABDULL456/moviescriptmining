ALEX Big something. I hope he knows how to work without a net. 
AOKEE Well. We all grow up sometime. He not drop a tray of dishes in days. Something going right.   You think he ready? 
ALEX I guess we'll both find out on Sunday.     I sure hope so. 
WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made. 
57        EXT NEAR SUNSET - TIME SHACK                                   57 
ROBBIE, ALEX, AMY and KATIE are clocking out for the day. ROBBIE clocks out first. TIFFANY drives up in her convertible. 
TIFFANY (waving him over) Robbie! 
ROBBIE goes over to talk to her.    WE SEE him go around to the passenger side. 
ROBBIE (shouting) Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home! 
ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at what they've seen. 
ALEX (disbelief) Tiff? 
AMY (grossed out) Tiff? 
KATIE (forlorn, stunned) Tiff. 
WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate.     We see KATIE walk slowly out of the park alone. 
As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and 
Page 60 of 81 
ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite". 
We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her back and see she is crying. 
58        EXT. EARLY MORNING. - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            58 
We see the rising sun behind AOKEE's head as he raises a conch shell and blows it like a horn. He is dressed like a Hawaiian prince. 
As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females dressed in Hawaiian native garb. ROBBIE And ALEX are among several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance. 
AOKEE Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo. 
The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha". 
There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison. 
The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat, gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army. The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout. 
CONCESSIONS GIRLS AND BOYS Concessions! Concessions! Concessions! 
Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50 grounds kids sitting in rows. In our foreground there are six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to them, 2 each. 
To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles. The lead kid shouts: 
LEAD MARCHER Company!   Forward, march. 
THE DRILL team marches into full view. The grounds kids behind clap the march beat. The marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans. 
LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company!   Halt! 
They do.

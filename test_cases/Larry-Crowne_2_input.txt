The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW 
INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER 
On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI. 
Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes... 
MERCEDES TAINOT What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. 
(THEN) Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place.. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech. 
(THEN) And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? 
(THEN) What did I just say about Larry Crowne? The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each other. The men stifle laughs. 
DIBIASI 
Nothing. And I was just wrapping up here. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm so sorry. Please go on. 
DIBIASI Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods. 
DIBIASI (CONT'D) Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause. 
PINEDO Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last? 
DIBIASI Fourth quarter dramatics. 
(THEN) Not that it mattered to my Speech professor... 
MERCEDES TAINOT Congratulations all of you. 
MACK Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Not me, I have to stay objective. 
MACK I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding. 
It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of. 
As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room. 
INT. ECON. 1 - LATER 
Everyone is taking the final. 
Dr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands like a pair of binoculars. Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers. 
Larry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his Blue Book. 
DR. MATSUTANI The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves. 
INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN 
The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this part himself. He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's. 
MACK This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records. 
LARRY CROWNE Priceless at a buck apiece. 
EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER 
His furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car. 
PATIENCE 
A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture? 
LAMARR Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing. 
(THEN) What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff? 
LARRY CROWNE You'll get me top price. 
LAMARR You did learn. 
DIBIASI Pizza at last! 
LARRY CROWNE Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.

BROWN (CONT'D) What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised! 
BERTIE'S VALET We -- 
BROWN You'll talk when I'm finished! 
BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns back to the table. 
BROWN (CONT'D) That kind of disloyalty will not be tolerated in this house, is that clear? (beat, yelling) I said, is that clear?! 
There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY 
A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his copy of Punch. 
JENNER "Court Circular, Balmoral." (beat) "On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a display of sheep-dipping by local farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr Robert Burns himself ..." 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY 
BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same journal. 
JENNER (O.S.) "... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked on the slopes, accompanied by family and friend ..." 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY 
BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door. 
JENNER (O.S.) Mr Brown retired early. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY 
BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled. 
BROWN If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked. 
PONSONBY I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty. 
BROWN Don't think I can't persuade her. 
PONSONBY I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor. 
BROWN This is a slur on her good name. 
PONSONBY In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you. 
BROWN Nobody has any rights over me. 
PONSONBY We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you. 
BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat. 
BROWN You'll regret saying that. 
FADE TO BLACK.

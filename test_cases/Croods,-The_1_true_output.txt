Grug climbs back up. 
UGGA Off! 
GRUG I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is about. 
UGGA She's working through some things and needs her own space. 
GRUG What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me. 
A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's ledge. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Hey! 
UGGA See? She's listening. 
GRUG If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules. 
UGGA How about a story? Eep loves those. 
Grug brightens. 
GRUG (BRIGHTENING) That's a good idea ... How about a story, huh? 
THUNK Oh yeah, tell us a story. 
The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from the bone-crib. 
GRUG Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite? 
EEP I haven't played with that thing in years. 
GRUG Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear. 
Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays put. As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave. 
GRUG (CONT'D) A long time ago, this little bear was alive. She was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror. So she was happy. But Krispy had one, terrible problem. She was filled with... curiosity. 
UGGA Grug! 
Ugga covers Sandy's ears. 
GRUG Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top. 
THUNK Wha? 
GRUG And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died. 
Grug SWATS the painting. 
THUNK Just like that? 
GRUG Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face. 
Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified. 
GRAN Oh, same ending as everyday. 
THUNK (FREAKED OUT) I get it, dad. I get it. I will never do anything new or different. 
GRUG Good man, Thunk. 
Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending. UGGA Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up. 
All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.

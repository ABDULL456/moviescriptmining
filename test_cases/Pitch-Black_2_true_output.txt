INT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
As Riddick dabbles with flight controls. 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT 
As Fry, running, splashes past buildings. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He can't see much until... 
A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up the glow-worm light to see... 
More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The light drives them away. For now. 
INT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's actually startled by the sight of... 
Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her over. 
Eye-lock. 
Riddick opens the hatch. 
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain, Riddick in the light. 
RIDDICK Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman. 
FRY You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others. 
He laughs at that. 
FRY (CONT'D) I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do.. 
RIDDICK Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck. 
FRY What, you're afraid? 
RIDDICK Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see. 
FRY I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race. 
RIDDICK Truthfully? I wouldn't know how. 
Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With desperation edging her voice: 
FRY Then wait for me. I'll go back myself. Just give me more light for them. 
He tosses her a light. The broken one. 
FRY Just come with me! 
RIDDICK Got a better idea. Come with me. 
Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out. 
RIDDICK (CONT'D) They're already dead. Get on board. 
FRY You're fuckin' with me. I know you are. 
RIDDICK 'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that. 
FRY No, you see, I promised them...I have to...I have to go and.... 
She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it -- and he keeps slashing away. 
RIDDICK Step aboard, Carolyn. 
FRY (tortured) I can't....I can't.... 
RIDDICK (approaching, extending a hand) Here. Make it easy on you. 
FRY Don't do this to me....

CHARLES Hello Walter. 
WALTER Charles. 
CHARLES I'm sorry to interrupt. 
WALTER That's OK. 
CHARLES Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her. 
WALTER Why can't she go? 
CHARLES She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby. 
Walter is caught off guard. 
WALTER When? 
CHARLES Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements. 
WALTER I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles. 
CHARLES I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure. 
WALTER I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book. 
CHARLES You're only teaching one class, Walter. 
WALTER So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now. 
CHARLES I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point. 
Walter is trapped. He comes clean. 
WALTER Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it. 
CHARLES That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument. 
Walter just stares him. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Good bye. 
And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him. 
INT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT 
Walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar. 
The wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks down the bar and sets it in front of Walter. 
KAREN Here you go, cutey. 
WALTER Thanks. 
KAREN So I thought you forgot about me. Where've you been hiding? 
Karen automatically refills his wine glass. 
WALTER Just busy with work. 
KAREN Well you're never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse. I'm glad your back. Give a holler if you need anything. I'm just gabbing with one of my girlfriends. 
WALTER OK. 
She walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat. 
EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Two cars are parked in Walter's driveway. 
INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME 
Walter is packing, laying out his shirts on the bed. After a moment, Karen walks in, drying her hair with a towel. 
KAREN When are you going? 
WALTER Today after class. 
She takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in. 
KAREN Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. You want some coffee?

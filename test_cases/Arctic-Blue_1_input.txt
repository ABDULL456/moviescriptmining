121  INT.  THE TURTLE 
Anne Marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable. 
122  EXT.  THE TURTLE 
The vehicle gets closer.  It's the trappers' jeep.  It slows and parks on the Haul Road next to the Turtle. 
123  INT.  THE TURTLE 
Anne Marie peers out the window.  She gasps as she recognizes the jeep.  Ducking from sight below the window, she grabs Eric's coat and hurries into the rear module. 
124  EXT.  THE TURTLE 
Mitchell stays in the jeep.  Viking Bob and LeMalle get out and walk cautiously toward the Turtle. 
LeMalle stands midway between the jeep and the Turtle, cradling his carbine.  Viking Bob goes up the steps. 
125  INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE 
Anne Marie remembers something she should've taken with her: the rifle.  Too late.  She hears Viking Bob's FOOTSTEPS (OS) come up the wooden stairs outside. 
126  EXT.  THE TURTLE 
Viking Bob knocks on the front door.  He peers through the sheer curtain on the window, into the front module. VIKING BOB Hullo? 
He shrugs to the others, then tries the door.  It's unlocked. 
Mitchell gets out of the jeep, spits and follows the others in, his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his leg. 
127  INT.  THE TURTLE 
Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.  She closes it behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear module. 
The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is still warm, etc.  The emptiness is ominous.  LeMalle picks up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if (CONTINUED) 127  CONTINUED: 
it's recently been fired.  Viking Bob notices the damaged radio. VIKING BOB Somebody left in a big hurry. (to LeMalle) Check outside. 
128  EXT.  THE TURTLE 
LeMalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around. 
NEW ANGLE 
In the back, Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch behind her to cover her tracks in the snow, then climbs into the utility compartment where Wilder's body was stored. 
A moment later, LeMalle comes around the corner.  He notices bear tracks and scat from the prior night's visit. LEMALLE (calls out to others) Grizzly sign.  Looks fresh. 
Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle.  They point their flashlights around, spotting footprints and marks going off into the woods.

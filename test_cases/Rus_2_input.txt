BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast table.. 
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) What did you expect? That Niki would give you the championship lying down? Of course not. He's a fighter. He's going to come at you with everything he's got. But you can do this. As a driver, you're his equal - better, maybe. And God knows you're quick and brave enough. You just..

Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

JAMES can't believe it. NIKI. 
JAMES I'm afraid it was a joke.. 
STEWARDESS (liking the look of JAMES) Awwww. Pity. 
JAMES Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not tonight. 
JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then, after a moment... 
He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to disappear into the elevator...

Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING? JAMES leaps out of bed.

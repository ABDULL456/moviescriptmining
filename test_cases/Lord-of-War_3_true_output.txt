YURI Hey, not those!  You don't touch the plane! (plaintive moan) Not the fucking seats... 
Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust - VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents. 
Too late.  The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away on the back of a thin cow. 
Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane. 
Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay - empty. 
Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals. 
Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush. 
Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a lifevest. 
VALENTINE Hey, you! 
The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) (exasperated) Forget it. 
The entire cargo has gone.  An errant bullet falls off a shelf in the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up. 
YURI sits innocently on his soda crate. 
A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase, rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground. 
MBIZI You run from us. (flashing a machete in Yuri's face) Can you run with no legs? 
Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri. 
VALENTINE No, Mbizi.  No, no, no. 
Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot.  Mbizi still wants a piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner. 
MBIZI Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.  He is a devil.  Let me disappear him. 
VALENTINE I can't do that. 
MBIZI Look where we are.  Who will know? 
VALENTINE We will. 
Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine. 
MBIZI Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.  I will go to hell to stop him. 
VALENTINE (gently) No. (to his Agents) Find the pilots. 
Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck. 
Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off.  Valentine handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back on it. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) I've spent my whole career on the right side of the line.  You're the first man I've encountered who makes me seriously consider crossing it. 
YURI What's the charge? 
VALENTINE What are you doing in Sierra Leone? 
YURI I'm on safari. 
VALENTINE (referring to the bullet) Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns? 
YURI Are you with the park service?  Hunting without a license - is that the charge? 
VALENTINE You're trafficking arms. 
YURI Trading.  But without evidence who can say? 
VALENTINE Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other. (hesitates, unsure whether to waste his breath - wastes it anyway) Do you know why I do what I do? 
Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the cargo plane.  Valentine paces beside him. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) (ignoring him) There are more prestigious assignments, you know.  Keeping track of the nuclear arsenals.  You would think it more critical to world security.  It's not.  Nine out of ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms - like yours. Those missiles just sit in their silos. Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass destruction. 
Yuri regards his interrogator curiously.  Despite the sun beating down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life. 
YURI I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine. I admit, a shooting war is better for business.  But I'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss.  Just as long as they're firing. 
He regards Valentine with something approaching pity. 
YURI (cont'd) I realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons.  I also understand the unspeakable things that are done with Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson baseball bats and they aren't taking those off the market any time soon.  People will always buy guns.  Why not mine? 
Valentine appears to have no answer. 
YURI (cont'd) Can I go?  You've got nothing on me-- (unable to resist) --but cuffs. 
Now Valentine smiles. 
VALENTINE I am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.

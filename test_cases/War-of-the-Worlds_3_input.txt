Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"? 
RAY 
(shakes his head in displeasure because he can't think of it) I don't remember that one. 
RACHEL 
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"? 
RAY 
I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one either. 
Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. 
RAY 
(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. So don't put me down. Because I've got the fastest set of wheels in the town. Something comes up to me that don't even try.... 
Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing... 
RAY 
(continues singing) ... If I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly. She's my little deuce coupe. You don't know what I've got... just my little deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't know what I've got.... 
Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland taps two glasses together and says... 
HARLAND 
Peach schnapps. 
Ray gets up and begins walking towards him. 
HARLAND 
Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole case of this shit. 
Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. 
RAY 
Thank you. 
Silence falls over for a period. 
HARLAND 
I'm sorry about your son. 
RAY 
We got separated... he's gonna meet us in umm... in Boston. 
Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask... 
RAY 
Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did you loose anybody? 
HARLAND 
All of them. 
Another pause. 
HARLAND 
(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. 
RAY 
(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier. 
They shake hands. 
HARLAND 
I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. You're welcome to stay, both of yous. 
Ray gets up from the conversation. 
RAY 
I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. 
HARLAND 
(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) Those machines, those tripods they got... They buried them... right under our feet. Since before there were even people here. They've been planning this for a million years. We're beat to shit. 
Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may hear what he may say next.

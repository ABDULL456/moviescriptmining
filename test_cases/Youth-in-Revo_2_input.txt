They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows. Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint. 
MRS. SAUNDERS Paul? Your father looks rather strange. 
PAUL Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement. 
MRS. SAUNDERS That's no excuse. Another helicopter passes overhead. 
TAGGARTY The food is delicious, Paul. 
PAUL Thank you. 
(BEAT) Sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of Thanksgiving? 
SHEENI Not long enough, Paul. 
NICK I hope it's the first of many such occasions for me. Sheeni narrows her eyes at him. A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then- Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song. 
MRS. SAUNDERS Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/ Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright... Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick. 
EVERYONE Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep in heavenly pee-eace. 
And with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens the door. 
TAGGARTY Oh, Trent, you made it. Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains. 
TRENT Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone. Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap. 
SHEENI Trent, darling, this is Nick. Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes. 
TRENT Nick, at last we meet. 
NICK Hello, Trent. 
TAGGARTY Have a seat, Trent. 
TRENT I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay. I have bad news. 
SHEENI What is it? 
TRENT Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide. Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard. 
TRENT She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma. 
SHEENI The poor girl. 
TRENT There's more. Before I left school, I searched her room. 
NICK Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials? 
TRENT No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In Bernice's closet, I found this letter. He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket. 
TRENT In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied. 
TAGGARTY Nick, you didn't! 
NICK Well, you see... 
SHEENI Nick! You could have killed me! 
MR. SAUNDERS Who died? 
TRENT No one yet, Mr. Saunders. Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction. 
MRS. SAUNDERS 
ARREST HIM! 
TRENT I can't arrest him. But I have called the Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now. Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands. 
NICK Well, I shall be going now. Please continue without me. 
TRENT Nick, I suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man. Nick stops in front of Trent. 
NICK Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent. And please, do drop dead. The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the doorway.

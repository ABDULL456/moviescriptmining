{"train": "DECEPTION \nWritten by \nMark Bomback & Patrick Marber \nSeptember 15th,  2005 \nI . \nEXTREME CLOSE ON A CELL PHONE resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827 RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT \nWe pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys. \nINT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT \nA wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table, empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure hunched over a laptop. Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a gentle, intelligent demeanor. Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing. \nINT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT \nBriefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors. \nINT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT \nWaiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk. \nJONATHAN Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet? The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up. \nOLD MAN It is tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Right. I forgot. The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him -- \nOLD MAN Anything else? \nJONATHAN Uh - no. No that's it, thanks. \nEXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT \nJonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound. Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first floor marked by unlit neon: \"FLEURS DE SOLANGE.\" He ascends the steps, his keys out -- \nWOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.) Jonathan! The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent, standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket. \nJONATHAN Solange, you're up so late? \nSOLANGE So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour. \n(GRINS) So tell me, you have been out with a lady friend, oui? \nJONATHAN \n(SMILES) Je suis desole, madame, mais no. \nSOLANGE But why else does a young man come home at such an hour? \nJONATHAN Just working late, that's all. \nSOLANGE Every night working late, working late. (teasing him) Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister Mischief maker - I know this! You come by \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires Worth and Berman to give their blessing to our books, and they send you? \nJONATHAN Have laptop, will travel. What about you? \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) What about me? \nJONATHAN Well, I didn't get your name for one.th-- The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out. \nMALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.) .ose. \nJONATHAN Sorry - I didn't catch that? (gets no response) Hello...? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMALE VOICE                                                       (O.S.) I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door - - only the men's room is now empty. \nCOMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE) Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nAlone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger. \nPETERSON                                                         (O.S.) Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to- confirm you're wrapping up over there at Rutherford Stern because the controller at Clancey has been on me to get someone in there by Thursday. I told him how brilliant you are, said you're the best auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you some documentation... Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a day planner, stylus writes \"Clancey\" into next week. Other than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nJonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch - \nMALE VOICE   (O.S.) 12:53                                                            a.m. Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the' doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice: \nWYATT Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home and saw the lights. We met before, in the can... \nJONATHAN Sure. It's Wyatt, right? WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something very likeably \"on\" about him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT So do you normally work this late? \nJONATHAN Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to finish up. What about you? \nWYATT You kidding? This is an early night. Hard to believe that once upona time a man's success was measured by how little he had to work. You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation? (regards his stacked files) Do-you like accounting? \nJONATHAN It's all right, if you enjoy working with numbers. Do you like being a lawyer? \nWYATT It's all right. If you enjoy working with assholes. Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen. \nWYATT Well, I'm probably disturbing you - \nJONATHAN No - it's okay. Really. \nWYATT So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have to like be in Mensa to work there? Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly. \nWYATT Been with them long? \nJONATHAN Since my senior year of college. They subsidized my graduate degree. \nWYATT Really. So you were poor? Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question. \n(CONTINUED) \nS. \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Well - I guess you could say that. I was raised by a single mother, and she died when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people have had it worse. \nWYATT Not around here. Practically every suit I know is Harvard by way of Andover. \nASSISTANT CONTROLLER Uh huh. Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back. \nJONATHAN Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose's office? The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance. \nJONATHAN Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here. She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's eyes follow her lazy finger down the list -- \nA GRUFF VOICE (O.S.) Hey, quit looking down her shirt! Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor. \nWYATT Leaving, huh? So where to next? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols after that. Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder. \nWYATT Hey, wait up a sec. (smiles back) Well, good meeting you, Jonathan. ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer. Jonathan bends for his briefcase - \nWYATT                                                           (O.S.) Wait, so you have off tomorrow? Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall. \nWYATT You don't happen to have .a. decent backhand, do you? \nINT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY \nBeneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's). Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return. \nSAME SCENE - LATER A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it back. Jonathan returns it with equal force. A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball. Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two inches outside the opposite baseline. \nWYATT Out! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space. \nWYATT Commiserations, Messer. Good game. They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted. \nWYATT \n(WARMLY) Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat the crap out of me. Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter. The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net. \nWYATT They asked if we'd fancy a post-game cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it. Jonathan is barely able to speak. \nJONATHAN Oh? I would've been happy to. \nWYATT Are you kidding? They're a couple of first years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do better. Hey, you OK? Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet. \nINT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE \nSoft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area. Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket. \nWYATT Man, I remember when these first came out. I think I was a frosh at boarding school. (chuckles; fingers a string) Jeez, are these strings natural gut? \nJONATHAN Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I should replace them, they're all frayed... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar. From behind, it looks remarkably like \"S\"... Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise. \nINT. LOCKER ROOK! \nWyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers. Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment - \nWYATT Have you ever considered contacts? Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       - his eyeglasses in particular. \nJONATHAN Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was allergic to something in the solution. \nWYATT Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your eyes especially. Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel. \nWYATT It's not a come on, just an observation. (considers him a beat) You don't get much, do you. \nJONATHAN What - you mean sex? \nJONATHAN Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off. \nWYATT You hope you can pull it off. You know who you remind me of? James Getz. \nJONATHAN Who? \nWYATT A guy I roomed with freshman year at Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when you loosened him up. Only from day one, he just didn't fit in. For starters, he was dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there was always this boundary - this wall - between Getz and everyone else. You could argue we laid the foundation, but he built it. Built it by believing the lie. \nJONATHAN What lie? \nWYATT That he was any different. The clothes, the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all one big masquerade. Anyone can get in, you've just got to wear a costume. But Getz never got that. He assumed he could never scale the wall, when the truth is he was the only one guarding it. It never occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset. No one gets over like the guy who's just a face, an impression. We are - all of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be. \nJONATHAN So what happened to him? \nWYATT Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself. \nJONATHAN (hesitates a beat) You're pulling my dick, aren't you. Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT With both hands. Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit. \nCUT TO: CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat. He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders: \nEMCEE And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine, the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour! \nINT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT \nAn ultra-elite \"new burlesque\" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female, sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease. Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience. \nWYATT It's a little self-conscious, but I thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's that suit working out? \nJONATHAN Oh - great, actually. \nWYATT Keep it then. I've got two just like it. Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives. \nWAITRESS Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen. \nJONATHAN Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass? \nWYATT We'll try not to spill any. (regards the floor show) So what's the wildest thing you've ever done? Sexually, I mean. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've never been too adventuresome. \nWYATT All right, what's the lamest thing then? \nJONATHAN The lamest... Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it. \nJONATHAN Actually, that was probably a few months ago. I was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back. It read something like \"Are. you feeling all alone? Looking to meet women but have forgotten how?\" And-there was this number. \nWYATT And you called it? So what happened? \nJONATHAN Nothing actually. The phone just kept ringing. And that's it. Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up. \nJONATHAN Lame enough for you? \nWYATT You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine. That is beyond lame. Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan. \nJONATHAN .Hello? Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan. \nJONATHAN .All right... Goodbye. Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt. \nJONATHAN She wants to dance. \nON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table, where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone. Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself. The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear... \nINT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING \nClancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger, pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its. \nCLANCEY CONTROLLER Any problems, you'll want to see Julie Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       - or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we have two staff accountants                                     - but like I said, I don't anticipate any problems. I mean we've never had any before, so... \nJONATHAN Right.I just need the access codes for the accounts and sub-accounts? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy. \nJONATHAN You've got account numbers, but no access codes. Without those I can't get the banks to authorize statement verification. (beat; smiles) Besides, how else can I steal the money? \nCLANCEY CONTROLLER What? \nJONATHAN Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I do need those codes though, when you get a chance. \nINT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nOther than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed. Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall. Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish. CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead, beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING - \nWYATT (O.S.) Hey, Jonathan. \nJONATHAN How'd you know it was- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT (O.S.) You really ought to block your caller ID. So - same place as yesterday? \nEXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY \nAlong the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite. \nWYATT I wonder what the Founding Fathers would make of this scene. Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat. \nJONATHAN I'm just glad to be outside. (awkwardly heartfelt) I've got to tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch. I used to just- A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge. \nWYATT Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine. Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's. \nWYATT Rutherford needs me to join him asap in London to paper some financing with Lloyds. I tell you about this? \nJONATHAN No - no you didn't. \nWYATT Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks. Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in. \nJONATHAN Sounds exciting. \nWYATT Nah, it'll be boring as sin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises from the ledge. \nWYATT Shit, I'd better get back. You ready? \nINT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nSitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone and punches in some numbers. \nCOMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.) \nI'RN-SORRY-THE-VOICE-MAIL-PASSWORD-YOU- \nENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR- He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it. \nJONATHAN Jonathan Mess- CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger. \nINT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nSAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait, glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWOMAN'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.) Pardon me, but may I ask you something - personal? Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit. \nTHE BLONDE Are you waiting for me? \nJONATHAN I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt, right? \nTHE BLONDE Excuse me? (hesitates, appraising him) I'm sorry, did we speak earlier? \nJONATHAN Yes. Yes we did - \nTHE BLONDE Good. Let's go then. \nINT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR \nJonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair. Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand. \nJONATHAN (whispers aside) Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and I., we don't know each other...? She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips. \nTHE BLONDE No fooling. DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows. \nTHE HALLWAY Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room. \nJONATHAN What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him. \nTHE BLONDE You're not who I spoke with on the phone? \nJONATHAN No - I mean, yes, but - \nTHE BLONDE You're not attracted to me? \nJONATHAN Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          - \nTHE BLONDE It's just what... exactly? She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long. \nINT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER \nA smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's tentativeness is all but gone. Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language: \nTHE BLONDE Fuck. LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but she's fast asleep. \nINT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nOn the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open. Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am. He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her. \nINT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING \nShowered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDESK CLERK Sir, I'm showing that room as having checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning. \nJONATHAN Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there? \nDESK CLERK I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests. If you give me her name, I can confirm if she was registered here. \nJONATHAN Actually, the thing is... it's okay. Forget it. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING \nBRITISH ACCENT Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave you access didn't explain more. \n(SIGHS) Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   - the only rule that's even remotely malleable provided there's mutual consent, although I say if that's your thing, take it elsewhere. And finally... She halts a few feet from the registration desk. \nBRITISH ACCENT The initiator is responsible for the room. \nJONATHAN (takes him a second) Oh - so I should...? \nBRITISH ACCENT Precisely. \nBACK IN THE ELEVATOR Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A moment. DING. The elevator doors open. \nINT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThey are headed for a room as he ventures another question: \nJONATHAN So are there a lot of - people - who do this? She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan turns back to find her staring at him uneasily. \nBRITISH ACCENT How did you get into this? \nJONATHAN Well, a friend of mine - \nBRITISH ACCENT He uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN He's                                                          - well, he was going out of town. (off her frown) I'm doing something wrong, aren't I? \nBRITISH ACCENT It's not that, it's just... well, you strike me as something of a stowaway. In fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say you didn't belong here at all. Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation --- \nBRITISH ACCENT But obviously somebody felt you did. The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt! \nBRITISH ACCENT And I'm a sucker for bashful boys... She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and removes the key card from his hand. \nINT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride. \nINT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT \nJonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent. \nJONATHAN Can I ask you something? Why do you do this? \nBRITISH ACCENT Why are any of us doing this? For the economics of the arrangement. (rolls over, away from him) It's intimacy without intricacy. Jonathan's about to reply -- \nBRITISH ACCENT Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so... She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat. \nJONATHAN Well - good night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She doesn't reply. \nINT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS                                        - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE DAY \nJonathan.alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell: \nJONATHAN (into phone) Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess you're busy.with stuff over there. (smiles to himself) I've been kinda busy too! I've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone? \nEXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT \nJonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night. \nJONATHAN (V.0.) I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can see you grinning right now. Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps inside -- \nJONATHAN                                                        (V.0.) Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you. SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE: \nINT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT \nSOLANGE There really is no one? Jonathan evasively shakes his head. \nSOLANGE There should be, Jonathan. It is not good for a young man to be too much alone. He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him. Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his cell phone. A beat, then another... .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out into the night. \nINT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT \nChecking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men. Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan freezes, his eyes grow wide - \nWOMAN Excuse me... He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm... It's her.                                                       -It's \"S\". \nINT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR \nJonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's oblivious, smiling casually back at him. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \n\"S\" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside. Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued. \"S\" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the wrists of her blouse, then the collar button. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next -- \nJONATHAN Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you. She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front clasp of her bra. \nJONATHAN Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met before. In the Times Square subway station. It was raining... \n\u00e2\u0080\u009e S \u00e2\u0080\u009e \n(GRINS) In the subway? \nJONATHAN You had no umbrella. You were soaked. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eC,. It's true, I don't have an umbrella. \nJONATHAN Then you asked me if the N train stops at Canal. She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse. \nJONATHAN Wait. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS\u00c2\u00bb Is something the matter? \nJONATHAN This just seems strange, that's all. \nS\u00c2\u0080\u008e Because you've seen me before? \nJONATHAN Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 - \n(EXHALES) Ever since that night on the train, I've thought about how nice it would be to see you again. And now suddenly, here you are, taking off your clothes. \u00e2\u0080\u009e S of Bingo! So what's the problem? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN It's just that- \n\"S,1 (a generous smile) Hmm, it is kind of a gear-shift. She starts to button her blouse back up. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS\u00e2\u0080\u009e Well, maybe some other time. Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat - \nJONATHAN Wait - don't go. She glances back curiously. \nJONATHAN What I mean is, by any chance... are you hungry? \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN \nA BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing early editions of the New York Times before each room. He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear the sound of JONATHAN AND \"S\" TALKING AND LAUGHING... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nThey sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously. You have some ketchup on your chin. \nJONATHAN sorry, I'm a messy eater. \u00e2\u0080\u009es\u00e2\u0080\u009e Me too. Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up. \nCONTINUED: \nALSIP You work in a bank? \nJONATHAN Nahh, I'm... I'm kind of an accountant. us,, Now I bet that's just what you wanted to do when you were a kid! \nJONATHAN Oh yeah. I'm living the dream. Feel free to leave now. u S \u00e2\u0080\u009e Still here. \nJONATHAN So what about you? \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS\u00c2\u00bb No, we're still on you, Frank. Off Jonathan's look, 'Frank'? \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS.11 You look like a Frank. So, Frank, when you were a little boy, what did you wanna be when you grew up? .Jonathan thinks. Confesses: \nJONATHAN A pro tennis player. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS,. Huh! I wanted to be an umpire. \nJONATHAN You're kidding? \u00e2\u0080\u009es\u00e2\u0080\u009e Really! I loved the idea of sitting in that big, high chair. (umpire voice) 'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.' \nJONATHAN I can see it. An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: a, S 11 I used to love this song. \"S\" stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her hand out to Jonathan. He smiles, shakes his head. \nJONATHAN Trust me, it's not a pretty sight. \n\"S:, I'll be the judge of that. He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it. is S Il See? You just need the right partner. She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance together. He's falling even harder for her. As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn escapes her. She covers her mouth. of S+\u00e2\u0080\u009e I'm so sorry. Suddenly I'm crashing. She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They lie back, side by side. \nJONATHAN I'd like to see you again. Not in a hotel. it S+ \" Hmm. I'd have to think about that. \nJONATHAN How about tomorrow? /. S to It is tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe. And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away. He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: to the purse, then back at \"S,\" sleeping peacefully on his arm... and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any more. \nINT. THE HUDSON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nCLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open. JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair. He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself. He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE on the desk on hotel note paper: Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will call u later. Sunbeam xxx He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings. Jonathan picks it up. \nMAN'S VOICE                                                     (V.0..) Are you free tonight? A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter. \nJONATHAN Hey! Are you back in town? \nWYATT (V.0.) I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K.. I'm stuck here at least another week. \nJONATHAN Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night - at the Hudson. \nWYATT (V.0.) The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been enjoying my little gift. \nJONATHAN Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl. \nWYATT (V.0.) That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal? \nJONATHAN She's a member of your naughty little sex club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God conversation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT (V.0.) That's extremely naughty of you! So what happened, Romeo? \nJONATHAN I'd like to say it's a long story but it's not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her. \nWYATT (V.0.) So she's, what, a lawyer or something? \nJONATHAN I-have no idea, I don't know all that much about her. All I know is I can't wait to see her again. \nWYATT (V.0.) Listen, I don't want to dampen your spirits, but - be careful, okay? \nAn intimate place, Jonathan and \"S\" are the only patrons at this late hour. They sit across from each other, grinning at \"Duck On Bike\" as it totters across the table, trips over a chopstick and flails on its side. /t S \u00e2\u0080\u009e Oh, poor Duck On Bike! She uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table. \nJONATHAN You gotta respect him; he just keeps at it. A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in Chinese. \"S\" points to the characters like an expert. J! $ Ft We'll have this... and this... oh, and let's try one of these. Thank you. The Waiter nods, walks off. \nJONATHAN What did you order? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \u00e2\u0080\u009e S of I have absolutely no idea. \nJONATHAN How do you know we'll like it? \nS\" How do you know we won't? Jonathan gazes at her a beat. \nJONATHAN This is so...not my life. \nIs that a good thing? \nJONATHAN More than you know. \nO \" smiles. Jonathan looks at her. \nJONATHAN Ever since that night on the subway - I haven't stopped thinking about you. She lowers.her eyes. \nJONATHAN Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. She slowly looks up again, touched. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS\u00e2\u0080\u009e Are you always so honest? \nJONATHAN No. it S., Even so, I'm not sure I believe you. Jonathan's look, 'why not?' \n\"S.\u00e2\u0080\u009e You're in the sex club! Another anonymous guy looking for anonymous action. I'm not judging you, I'm in. there too, but don't say you've been solemnly holding atorch for me for - how long is it -- wow, one whole month! Jonathan smiles. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Point taken. But I've thought about you a lot. \n,.S.,, In between the mindless shtupping? \nJONATHAN And sometimes during. She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks. \nJONATHAN So how come you got involved in the club? She frowns slightly, thinks. \u00e2\u0080\u009es . If Wouldn't it be great if you could just meet someone and not have to do the 'work/ family/previous relationships' thing? Isn't who we are right now so much more interesting than where we've come from? \nJONATHAN Sure... but that didn't really answer my question. She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly. \u00e2\u0080\u009e S of I know it seems like I'm holding out on you, but I'm not. It's just                                  - I turned thirty this year, and I made this vow to live only in the present. And it's good, you know? And yes, maybe it's because there are things in my past I don't care to think about - but that's the same for everyone, isn't it? He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this. is S . \u00e2\u0080\u009e I like you. I hope you like me. Can't that be enough? Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter brings their food and goes. \nJONATHAN I wasn't asking for an autobiography, you know. I was just curious. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: If S. IS (a beat) A woman I know used to do it. So I decided to give it a try. For various reasons, it suits my present situation. \nJONATHAN You mean the intimacy without intricacy. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS . 110 It has its merits. At least I thought it did... until you came along. He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts in on the food. Outside we can hear rain starting to fall... \nEXT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - LATER \nJonathan and \"S\" step out into pouring rain, pause under the shabby awning. Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables. She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece. \nJONATHAN Oh - no thanks. \nJIS.11 Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I buy it at a store nearby. It has ginseng in it, you know, for energy. It's not bad, though it sort of tastes like hairspray. She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips. She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it: a sadness. Almost an uneasiness. \nJONATHAN Hey, are you all right? \n\"S\u00c2\u0080\u008e I don't want to complicate your life. \nJONATHAN Too late.                                                       -- I want all the complication you've got. She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions. it Sc, Your glasses. They're fogging up. She reaches out and gently removes his glasses. \n(CONTINUED) \nINT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM \nJonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses, staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at something that's caught his eye... HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved. Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark - (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in \nA SPARE BEDROOM Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through faded file folders crammed with papers and documents. \nJONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE) .Your ad says                                                     24-Hour Locksmith... Well how soon could you-... Fine. He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked \"CREDIT CARDS.\" Sorting through old statements, he finds the line: \"To report a card lost or stolen...\" \nINT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN \nCLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money. Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock. \nINT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nJonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear- stained, his eyes clouded. \nJONATHAN (V.O.) This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able to come in today. I'm - pretty ill... 'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses. \nINT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY \nJonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off into.restless sleep. We MOVE IN TIGHTER ON HIS FACE, tighter -- \nCONDUCTOR (O.S.) Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next. \nJonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers. \nEXT. CANAL STREET - DAY \nJonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jonathan pauses by a STREET VENDOR, takes from his pocket the GUM WRAPPER he found in the hotel, shows it to the vendor... \nINT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY \nCramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter, where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper. \nJONATHAN I was told you sell this gum here? The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a candy display. In one box is the same gum. \nJONATHAN A woman - a white woman - buys this brand of gum. I need to find- The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese. \nJONATHAN I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the woman I'm talking about? A white woman...? Please, it's very important that I                              -- \nGIRL'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.) My grandmother doesn't speak English. Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock. \nJONATHAN Can you ask if she knows the name of the white woman who buys this gum? The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes. a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan. \nGIRL She says they sell that gum in practically every store in Chinatown. \nEXT/INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJonathan is struggling with his stiff new key, hearing his PHONE RINGING inside. \nINT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT \nJonathan rushes for the phone, picks up. \nJONATHAN Hello? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE RUSSO Mr. Messer? \nINT. NY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - LOBBY                       - AN HOUR LATER. \nCreepy and drab. Jonathan enters, approaches a RECEPTIONIST. The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective Russo. Jonathan looks very worried. \nINT. M.E.'S OFFICE                                              - A RICKETY ELEVATOR \nJONATHAN Messer. Jonathan Messer. I'm an auditor from worth and Berman. \nINT. RUTHERFORD STERN - CORRIDOR \nJonathan walks alongside Ms. Pomerantz. \nPOMERANTZ Are you sure you have the right firm? \nJONATHAN Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen him working here. I net him here. \nPOMERANTZ When was this? \nJONATHAN A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here. He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion. \nPOMERANTZ I don't know what's going on, but I can assure you, there is nobody here named- \nJONATHAN I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake we smoked pot in the conference room! Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER - \nFLASH INSERT -= COFFEE LOUNGE This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line. Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm. \nJONATHAN Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt. \nLAWYER Who? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him, cracking jokes in the coffee lounge. FLASH ON SAME SCENE: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly. \nLAWYER I crack jokes with a lot of people. \nJONATHAN Hold on, you're telling me you don't-- \nLAWYER Hey - easy with the hands, okay? Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz. \nJONATHAN He said he was in London with Mr. Rutherford, paperinga - \nMS. POMERANTZ                                                   (O.S.) Mister Messer. Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat. \nMS. POMERANTZ Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering from hip surgery. In New Jersey. Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers, assistants, mail clerks                                         - all staring at him. \nINT. WYATT'S BROWNSTONE - DAY \nBreathless, Jonathan bolts up a set of stairs, knocks on a door. No answer. He knocks harder. From within we hear a set of FOOTSTEPS. Sound of a lock turning, the door is opened... \nJONATHAN Wyatt - .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types. \nJONATHAN Sorry, I                                                        -- I need to speak to Wyatt. \nMAN Excuse me - Wyatt? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN Wyatt Bose. He lives here. \nWOMAN In this building? He must be new. See, we've been out of town the past2 months - \nJONATHAN Not in this building - in this apartment. \nMAN \n(FROWNS) Young man, we've owned this apartment going on thirty years now. \nJONATHAN But... I was right-here-with him... The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary expression, his hand making for the chain lock. \nJONATHAN \n(DESPERATE) Wait!! That painting there, it's                              a Gerhard Richter, right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN (anxious to hang up) Oh - okay, thanks- \nRUSSO                                                      (O.S.) Are you sure you didn't know Simone Forester? The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses... \nJONATHAN I told you before - \nRUSSO                                                      (O.S.) I remember what you said. (an unsettling silence) And you weren't at the Hudson two nights ago? \nJONATHAN I don't                                                    -- why are you- \nRUSSO             (O.S.) Turns out among credit card charges made that night, there was one with your name. The card was declined. \nJONATHAN I cancelled them all, the day they got stolen. \nRUSSO (O.S.) I see. I figured it didn't mean much - cards move quickly. It just struck me, you know.. The coincidence. Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause. \nRUSSO                                                      (O.S.) By the way, the morgue confirmed strangulation as cause of death. He found trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound. \nJONATHAN Kevlar? \nRUSSO (O.S.) It's used in certain kinds of rope and string. Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to the hall closet door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUSSO      (O.S.) Mr. Messer? \nJONATHAN Yes                                                            - yes, I'm              -- \nRUSSO      (O.S.) Thought I lost you for a second. \n(PAUSE) Well, I won't keep you. You have a good night. Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door. In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone. \nSAME - MOMENTS LATER Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches for the phone, and dials... another number. \nJONATHAN I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I know you're trying to frame me for it, so - so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to God I'll... Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and realizing he's now talking to himself. \nCOMPUVOICE \nTO-SEND-THIS-MESSAGE--PRESS-POUND-OR- simply-hang-up. To-erase-and-record-a-new- messa ge---press-Star. Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder: \nJONATHAN It's me. I need to talk to you. He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something. Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy. QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his trophy raised as a makeshift weapon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING... RING... RING... Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up: \nJONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE This is Jonathan. Please leave a message. BEEEEP. A moment of hiss                                       - then: \nMALE VOICE (O.S. Jonathan? Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt --- \nPETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the window at the dark night and empty street below. \nPETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

SUBWAY CAR - MORNING \nJonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work. \nPETERSON                                                       (V.0.) They're our biggest client, so needless to say, make them your top priority... Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority- \nEXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY \nA series of shots: Jonathan asking around about \"S.\" The street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads. Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a headline: \"STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC.\" The photo is of Simone Forester. \nSTOP! He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through passengers, desperate for an open door to the other side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCONDUCTOR (O.S.) Shuttle to New York's Grand Central Station. Grand Central is next. He jumps off the train, in the direction she'd been walking -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL AWAY. He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a glimpse of her                                                  - no sign of her in any of the windows... .until the last car passes                                      - and there she is, standing at the rear observation window, her hand pressed to the pane, her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye. He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading vainly as he watches her recede, framed by the rectangle of window, directly beneath it the train's steel. exterior labelled the shuttle line's circled black and white S. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - LATE NIGHT \nTILT DOWN FROM THE CONSTELLATIONS of the vaulted ceiling to the tiny figure of \"S,\" standing at the ticket counter, staring uneasily through bars at a TICKET AGENT. \nTICKET AGENT Let's see - there's one to New Haven, leaving in... six minutes. If you need to go farther, you can transfer from there. \"S\" peers anxiously around her, like someone hunted. \n#; SIT And that's the very next train leaving? \nINT. METRO-NORTH TRAIN                                          (IDLING IN THE TERMINAL) \nOnly a few scattered travellers this late. \"S\" slumps into a seat, takes a breath - and starts to quietly break down. She shuts her eyes, tries to stifle her sobbing. A man's hand extends a handkerchief from the seat behind her. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS\u00e2\u0080\u009e No thank you. RACK FOCUS on the man withdrawing his handkerchief behind her, grinning coolly to himself: it's-Wyatt. \nWYATT Suit yourself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: RACK BACK TO \"S\" as her eyes blink open in terror -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. JONATHAN'S BUILDING - MAILBOXES - LATE NIGHT \nJonathan yanks open his mailbox. Empty. As he heads upstairs, there's a change in his face: a newly forged determination. He takes out his cell phone, dials. The other end immediately picks up: \nCOMPUVOICE                                                      (O.S.) \nWORTH-AND-BERMAN-VOICE-MAIL-BOX-FOR- \nJONATHAN'S VOICE                                                (O.S.)

He hits redial again as he opens the door to \nINT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT \nJonathan enters, phone still to his ear. \nCOMPUVOICE                                                      (O.S.) \nWORTH-AND-BERMAN-VOICE- Jonathan hangs up and just stares at the phone in his hand, on the verge of something like a scream. He takes a breath. Presses redial once more. Only now it RINGS. Jonathan freezes. RING... RING... RING... RING... RING -- a CLICK of someone picking up, then SILENCE and faint wisps of static. \nJONATHAN Hello...? Not a word from the other end. We barely make out BREATHING. \nJONATHAN Wyatt? Is that you? Jonathan takes a tentative step forward, as if fearful that the least movement will cost him this connection. \nJONATHAN Say something damn it! From the receiver we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.) (sung in a low whisper) Yesterday... Reeling, Jonathan grips the phone tighter to his ear. \nWYATT'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)

Now it seems as though - \nJONATHAN Answer me! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm. He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER. \nJONATHAN I live here. \nINT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nThick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker. His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down, furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls. \nFIRE WORKER Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat. Better get your valuables together. \nINT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM \nstill in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - \"Duck on Bike\" too. \nJONATHAN (calls out) How did it start? \nFIRE WORKER (O.S.) We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse. \nINT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM \nJonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket. \nINT. SPARE BEDROOM \nJonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take. He finds a file marked \"Bank Statements,\" pulls it, about to toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its contents --- CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new. Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea telling us the contents of each and every file have been swapped out with photos. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of Jonathan and \"S\" walking in Chinatown. He scans through others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel Lotus... TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication - \nFIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.) Mr. Messer? Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the doorway. He quickly shuts the file. \nJONATHAN Just                                                            - give me a minute. \nINT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM \nA paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently. \nFIRE WORKER That everything? Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation. \nJONATHAN I guess it is. \nFIRE WORKER You got someone you can stay with? \nINT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN \nThe sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK. \nNIGHT CLERK It's fifty for the night. Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what he discovers are his last three                                 $20s. \nINT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN \nEven more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows, stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and \"S.\" She's smiling up at him. EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in time, at once haunting and heartbreaking. He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway (\"BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED\"). His eyes drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him - FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN \"WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE\" of Wyatt with bleached hair styled in a loose spike -- IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: \"May 17.\" \nCUT TO: Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand. \nOFFICE ON PHONE Boston Police, how can I direct your call? Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him: \nJONATHAN This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some information from you guys. Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally - \nOFFICER ON PHONE Well? \nJONATHAN You've got a case, a missing person named William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen? \nOFFICER ON PHONE Hold a sec. \nWYATT I have some instructions. Follow them and I might let her live. \nJONATHAN Where is she? \nWYATT This should've been simpler. I frame you, you panic... \nJONATHAN Where is she?! A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts: \nJONATHAN Goddamn it tell me what you did to-- \nWYATT Press pause on the questions and listen. The brokerage firm you're auditing is Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that audit you're temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as access codes required for transactions. At                                   11                              p.m. tonight you're going to skim from those accounts a total of                                             $200 million and transfer that money to an account I've established overseas. \nJONATHAN I can't                                                         - I have no idea how to even- \nWYATT I know you don't. But I do. Your passport. (brandishes the gun) Now, please. Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it. And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE. \nWYATT It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their banks will just be opening. \nJONATHAN It won't work - they screen for stuff like this. It'll be discovered eventually. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT I can live with eventually. I always have. \nJONATHAN This account overseas                                   - it's in my name, isn't it? A moment of tense silence. Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then: \nJONATHAN Why'd you pick me? Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question. \nWYATT You answered the ad, Jonathan. (off Jonathan's confusion) \"Feeling all alone out there? Have a great job, fine personality and good looks to match, but no time to.meet that special someone? Help is just a phone call away -\" \nJONATHAN The ad - in Money magazine... \nWYATT \n(GRINS) Told you to block that Caller ID. Of course I had to scope out a whole lot of losers before I hit the jackpot. After all, there only so many Jonathan Messers out there. \n(BEAT) If you screw with me, well - you saw what I did to that Blonde? That's kindness compared to what I'll do to your little .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her when I'm through. \nJONATHAN Why should I believe you? Everything you told me was lies. \nWYATT Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now... now you're fucked. He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you. And... feel free to take a shower, looks like you could do with one. The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring shell-shocked at the envelope. \nEXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER \nJonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his suit pocket. As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an instant before the car would have hit him. Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY \nA stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an ASSISTANT enters. \nASSISTANT Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is here to see you. Jonathan Messer? \nPETERSON \n(PUZZLED) Really? Well - okay, bring him back. We follow the assistant out the door, read the name stencilled on the glass \"CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER.\" \nINT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY \nThrough a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is seated. She addresses him. He rises. \nINT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE \n(BEAT) Are you free tonight? A sudden, jarring SOUND ADVANCE OF MUSIC as we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - ROOFTOP - LATE NIGHT \nAn elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy. \nEXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT \nThe party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below, where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters... \nINT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY \nJonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF bustling. And, of course, the \"ELOISE\" PORTRAIT. \nWYATT (O.S.)' May I ask you a personal question? Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers. Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand. \nJONATHAN Where is she? \nWYATT In one of the rooms. Safe. (a thin smile) I got us a table. \nINT. LOBBY BAR - MOMENTS LATER \nA WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and Wyatt are seated. \nWAITRESS Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy. The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass. \nWYATT To friendship. Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt. \nJONATHAN Bansky's dead, isn't he? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWYATT He was dead when I met him. Just like you. The rest was a mere formality. (re: the laptop) Of course he didn't have your bargaining chip. Speaking of which... \nJONATHAN Not until I see her. She's the only reason I'm here and not at the police. \nWYATT I told you, she's in a room. Alive. \nJONATHAN Give me the key then. Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on the key card to indicate a room number. \nWYATT As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the room number. \nJONATHAN Not good enough. Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit. \nJONATHAN You won't let her live. You killed all the others, you'll have to kill us too. \nWYATT Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine. \nJONATHAN (scoffs, repulsed) You like me. \nWYATT I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all, you're my creation. I'm the one who gave you life. \nJONATHAN Don't you get it? It was her, not you! She's the one. She gave me life! You can steal my identity, but not what's here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by Jonathan's passionate outburst. \nWYATT Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for you both. Now, let's get on with it. \n(BEAT) I don't have all night, Jonathan. Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the key card. Jonathan opens his bag... \nSAME - MOMENTS LATER CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep. The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an access code. Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then pauses, looking confused. Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop, feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale. \nWYATT What is it? \nJONATHAN My wireless modem - I must have left it in the conference room. I can't get back online. Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething. \n", "test1_input": "JONATHAN Would you like some help, ma'am? \nOLD WOMAN I can manage, thank you. Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way. .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers. We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on. Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on the door, calls out: \nJONATHAN I can't get the card to work. He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel: red. He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence. \nJONATHAN Hello?... Hello? He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into the door. Nothing. Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into \nTHE ROOM He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets. Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket. Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed, splattered all over the crumpled sheets... Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of potatoes. \nBLACKOUT. \nTWO HOURS LATER THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV playing a different film now. OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little. Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood. Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet, shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of \"S.\" He runs into the bathroom. Also empty. Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED. He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them. He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in the morning, no one around. \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY \nTripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator. Jonathan tears off in its direction... He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor indicator overhead: \"4\" slowly creeps to \"3\". \nINT. STAIRWELL \nHis bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and continues to dash down... BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in \nTHE LOBBY His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild- eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' \"Yesterday.\" \nSLAM! OF JONATHAN'S HAND ON THE FRONT DESK \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word: \nJONATHAN help... \nINT. HOTEL LOTUS -                                            5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER \nTwo hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room 517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken... \nJONATHAN .I saw blood on the bed and then someone hit me. When I came to, she was gone. \nSECURITY 1 This woman you were with. What's her name? Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing. \nSECURITY 2 Sir? \nJONATHAN I don't know. (off their looks) It starts with an 'S'. I think. \nSECURITY 2 Was shea prostitute? \nJONATHAN No! No, she's just a person. A friend. \nSECURITY 2 A friend with no name. \nJONATHAN Of course she has a name! I just don't - we have to find her - something must have happened to her! \nINT. ROOM 517 \nThe two Security Guards are eyeing the bed. \nSECURITY 1 I thought you said there was blood? \nJONATHAN I told you, whoever did this must have cleaned it up while I was out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand. \n", "test1_true": "SECURITY 2 Maybe she took them. \nJONATHAN What?! \nSECURITY 2 It happens. \nJONATHAN She didn't do this, okay?! Something happened to her! You don't understand, we were... Wait! He sees something on the floor between the bed and night stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper. \nJONATHAN This                                                        -- this was hers... Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE. \nSECURITY                                                    1 Sir - are these your clothes? Jonathan nods absently. \nSECURITY 1 How about putting them on. \nINT. LOBBY - LATER \nJonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s) waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him. \nRUSSO Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo. \nINT. POLICE PRECINCT - RUSSO'S DESK - LATER \nStill shaken, Jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from Russo, amidst the din and traffic of the precinct. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUSSO \n(SCEPTICAL) And you don't know anything about her. Where she works? Where she lives? \nJONATHAN I told you how we met. \nRUSSO Through a sex group. Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes. \nRUSSO Does this group have a name? \nJONATHAN I don't                                                         -- it's not like that. \nRUSSO Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She only recalled seeing you check in. \nJONATHAN That's... that's the way it works. \nRUSSO All right. But now you're telling me that in addition to this mystery woman, there was another individual in the room? \nJONATHAN Not at first -- look, I know how it sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit me must have - I don't know -- taken her. Maybe even... He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications. \nRUSSO Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences like this before? Taking any sort of medication? \nJONATHAN I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished back there! There was blood all over the goddamn bed! He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUSSO Yeah. (glances at Jonathan) No, I don't think it's necessary... Right. She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely able to contain his devastation. \nJONATHAN What am I supposed to do? An awkward silence, then: \nRUSSO If you want to file a report regarding the items she - (corrects herself) - the items you claim were stolen... Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated. \nJONATHAN I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can I just                                                          - can I go? \nEXT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT \nJonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out.

HOTEL CASABLANCA - LOBBY - LATER \nJonathan anxiously escorts ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN past the quasi- Moroccan motif. Asking her something, he takes out a folded paper from his pocket, shows it to her: it's the photocopy of Bansky's license with the image of Wyatt's face. She quickly shakes her head, her eyes searching for the exit. \nINT. THE LOMBARDY - BAR - NIGHT \nJonathan trails a TALL WOMAN as she bee-lines for the exit. He grabs her arm, thrusts the photocopy into her hands. She halts, looks up at him... and tears it in two before handing it back and hurrying off, her glare full of paranoia. \nTNT. THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND - LOBBY - NIGHT Jonathan rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN. He gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in his eye. Takes out his cell, calls another number... \nINT. VARIOUS HOTELS - LOBBY COUCHES - NIGHT \nRapid jump cuts of A DOZEN DIFFERENT WOMEN'S FACES, all indicating twenty different kinds of \"no\"; with each cut the women occupy the exact same position in frame, only their faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change. \nINT. THE MICHELANGELO - ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nRoom key in hand, Jonathan rides up with a woman in a BLACK BUSINESS SUIT - a tall, attractive business-type. Jonathan stares at his shoes, trying to mask his. utter exhaustion. \nINT. THE MICHELANGELO - A ROOM - NIGHT \nJonathan and Black Business Suit come in. She starts to \nUNDRESS: \nJONATHAN I need to ask you something, it's incredibly important... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He pauses to unfold his now scotch-taped photocopy, shows it to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license photo. Jonathan braces himself for her departure                       - when she stares back up at him in scared but clear recognition. \nSAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT I was in Chicago on business, a little over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with one of our Chicago partners,.a man named Holloway. That's how I met him. TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO: \nINT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA slightly older man                                            (HOLLOWAY) sits with his back to us. Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.) At first I assumed he was a junior executive at their firm. But he wasn't. That's not to say he didn't work for Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate capacity... \nTNT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing - you know, this thing -- for a while. \nINT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nWyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.) I was simply curious. More so when he apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten about another engagement. Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT I was intrigued. He was intelligent, informed about everything from law to art to politics. I'd never met anyone so in command of his own charm. He said that he'd come from nothing, that everything he learned, he learned from his tricks. He claimed that Holloway was even grooming him for a position at his company. She lights another cigarette with her old one. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT In a way, I felt for him. But I also admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a way of making me feel - close to him, you know? This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT So I found myself telling him things.. Personal things. And, next thing I knew - \nJONATHAN You told him. About this. A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know all the details. \n(EXHALES) I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I was distracted... I was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be. \nINT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nWyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes. Exhausted, her body goes limp. TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress -- \n", "test2_true": "CLOSE ON Black Business Suit staring off, chilled by memory. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT Only afterwards I discovered two of my credit cards were missing. As was my cell phone. Of course I couldn't say anything to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd never report it to the police. \n(BEAT) So I just put the incident out of my mind. I all but forgot about it, until one night, maybe two months ago - \nINT. THE WARWICK (NYC)                                         - LOBBY - NIGHT \nBlack Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man looks up. It's Wyatt. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.) I almost didn't recognize him. But when I did, I suddenly felt very, very scared. She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look. \nBACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT I left before he saw me. She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space. \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT He must have used my cell phone to get into the group. (crushes out her cigarette) Anyway, that's it. That's all I know. She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises. \nJONATHAN Wait - thank you. (off her look) Have you ever run into him again? \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT Getz? No. And I don't ever want to. \nJONATHAN Getz? \nBLACK BUSINESS SUIT That was his name. Jamie Getz. \nEXT. FLEUR DE SOLANGE - NIGHT \nBundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices Jonathan coming down the front steps. \nSOLANGE Jonathan, you're home early - Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt. \nSOLANGE Oh - je suis desole. My mistake. Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps. Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face. \nINT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT \nHuddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall: \nJONATHAN (V.0.) who's James Getz? \nWYATT (V.0.) A guy I roomed with freshman year at Princeton. on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton University alumni. He types in: Getz, James. A beat - then: \"No match.\" A long list of G names follows. Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz. \nJONATHAN Shit. Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed. Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name. \"Sort no contact information available.\" Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types: \"Holloway Reed\" then decides to add the word \"missing.\" An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: \"BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED.\" A head-shot style photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his name: \"Reed Holloway.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Jonathan glances up at the Hotel employee manning the desk. \nJONATHAN Can I print this out? \nEXT. EIGHTH AVENUE                                              (HELL'S KITCHEN)   - LATE NIGHT \nPorn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway, reading over the printed article. \nEXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT \nJonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS. Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky -- \nEXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX \nJonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of his building! Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He continues racing toward his building... The neon \"FLEURS DE SOLANGE\" sign crackles and sparks in the flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers emit what must be an awful stench. Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays, burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over. She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible: \nSOLANGE Jonathan... He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance. \nJONATHAN' (to EMS worker) Is she going to be okay? \nEMS WORKER Yeah, she'll make it. \n", "test2_id": 3097, "test3_input": "Wide shot of an empty hotel hallway -- as suddenly the fire alarm blares to life.

The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910... Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907. He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot -- when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to -- - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese, indicating the ringing alarms. \nJONATHAN Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute. The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green. He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find - \nINT. ROOM 907 \n- nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View. Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere. The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set -- Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence. Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan taps it, he realizes: it's hollow. He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall... And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: \"S\". Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by how lifeless she appears - - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her face to his chest. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009eS., (whispers gratefully) You're alive. He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully. \nJONATHAN What do you say we stick together from now on? \nJA S\" I'd like that. \nINT.

Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him -- \nJONATHAN He's down there! I saw him - \n11 SIP Oh God - \nJONATHAN Up - we've got to go up! Clutching her arm, Jonathan and \"S\" turn back up, against the flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are evacuating.

They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though not as smartly attired.

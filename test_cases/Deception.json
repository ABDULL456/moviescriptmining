I'm- CLICK. Dead air. \nJONATHAN Hello?... Hello?! Jonathan SLAMS the phone down, tension in his face joined by a new emotion, something closer to. fury. \nJONATHAN I'm going to find you. \nEXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - STREET - DAY \nJonathan is heading for the Clute Nichols building, that same focused tension on his face - \nWOMAN'S VOICE Mr. Messer? Jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it. \nWOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (CONT'D) Jonathan. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He glances up... to find Russo standing near the entryway - what's she doing here? He has no choice but to meet her. \nRUSSO I was gonna call, but I was in the area. Just doing some follow-up. Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness. \nJONATHAN Follow-up? \nRUSSO On that missing girl of yours. The.one whose name began with. an \"S.\" Have any luck finding her? Jonathan absently tightens his grasp on his briefcase. \nJONATHAN No. No luck. \nRUSSO I see. That's too bad. she studies him a cryptic beat, then smiles flatly. \nRUSSO Well, who knows, maybe she'll turn up yet. You have a good day, Mr. Messer. Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off, feeling her watching him from the curb as he goes. \nINT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nEmployees pass by the glass behind which we see Jonathan - a lone figure at his laptop, surrounded by files and post-its. Close on Jonathan as he scribbles on a post-it: \"Yesterday - Beatles?\" Widen to find the post-its organized with his usual fastidiousness                                                  - only scribbled with words, not numbers: \"Wyatt Bose = William Bansky\" and other random scribblings. He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis, hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all. Reverse angle through the glass: to anyone passing, he looks like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor. Closer on Jonathan as he clutches the table, looks seconds away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly occurs to him. He whips around, gaze fixing on \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: His cell phone. He grabs it. Presses a key repeatedly - scanning                                                        - then hits SEND. Jonathan brings the phone to his ear, listens for the other end; then: \nJONATHAN Are you free tonight? \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE KITANO HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT \nJonathan waits anxiously by a Botero sculpture of a rotund dog. A young woman in a BLUE PASHMINA approaches. \nINT. THE KITANO - ELEVATOR \nBlue Pashmina enters first, Jonathan follows her into an empty elevator. The doors close. \nJONATHAN Do you know Wyatt Bose? \nBLUE PASHMINA (immediately guarded) Excuse me? \nJONATHAN What about William Bansky? Does that name-- She darts.for the \"Door Open\" button, but he blocks her path. \nBLUE PASHMINA I swear to God I'll scream. \nJONATHAN Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I just                                                            -- I'm looking for someone.and it's very important that I find him. she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her. \nJONATHAN He does this too - or he did. someone had to give him the numbers. Someone let him in. If I can-'find who it was that knew him, they might know where he's                                 -- she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel. Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out the opening doors before he's even looked up. SOUND ADVANCE: TENSE CLACKING of computer keys... \nINT. CLUTE NICHOLS                                               - CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME NIGHT \nCLOSE ON JONATHAN alone at the end of the conference table, eyes scanning files absently, fingers typing on auto-pilot. His gaze holds a new determination, as the CLACKING OF KEYS \nSET THE RHYTHM FOR A BRIEF MONTAGE- \n", "test3_id": 3098}

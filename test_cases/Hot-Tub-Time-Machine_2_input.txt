ADAM I don't wanna hear any more! They sit in horrified silence for a bit. 
LOU You'll have to introduce me when we get there. Your families won't know me. Although I'm sure they're huge fans. 
(ABRUPT) So hey, getting married, huh? Taking the plunge! Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused. 
NICK This makes no sense at all. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS. Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until -- A LILY (the flower) comes into frame. Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done: 
LILY Don't you ever let me take your phone again! 
ADAM 
(COY) I'm here on time. Just like I promised. Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat. 
ADAM (CONT'D) (no nerves at all) I'm so happy to see you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. 
LILY 
(TEARFUL) Me too! 
ADAM You're the one. Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES. 
LILY Oh my god, what happened? 
LOU (O.S.) My fault entirely, madam! The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO. 
GUY AT TABLE Hey, it's Lou Blustein! The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the guys can't believe it. 
LOU I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path. His broken leg is my broken heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She looks genuinely flattered. Lou gets up and whispers to Adam. 
LOU (CONT'D) See? I'm awesome here. You shoulda stayed out of that tub. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER 
Nick SLOW DANCES with Courtney. 
NICK I was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That's... if it's OK with you? 
COURTNEY Why wouldn't it be OK with me? That sounds nice. 
(SMILES) 
(MORE) 
COURTNEY (CONT'D) You look so good in this shirt, by the way. Nice choice. She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance. 
NICK So... how are your parents? 
COURTNEY Still working hard. I really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains. I mean, they just have the one store... 
FLASHBACK TO: 
EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - 1987 - DAY 
The Japanese Businessman is on a PAY PHONE, speaking RAPIDLY in Japanese. 
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN 
(IN JAPANESE) Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork! We have to get back to Tokyo. I have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal. Nick stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY.

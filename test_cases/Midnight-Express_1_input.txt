VARIOUS PASSENGERS What's he saying?  I don't know... Marian.  Hey Marian, what the hell... 
The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together their items and beginning to exit as: 
POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH 
POLICE OFFICER Idem. 
CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's panic.  Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now? He freezes. 
MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated. 
SUSAN Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey. 
Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped conversations, expletives, including: 
PASSENGERS They're checking for hijackers. Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades... 
Laughter is returned from several of the American contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the seat. 
SUSAN (OFF) Billy, what's the matter? 
BILLY My passport! 
SUSAN No! 
She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He grips her arm. 
BILLY (low voice) Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now. 
SUSAN (picking up the real fear in his voice) What is it? . . . Billy? 
BILLY (a fierce whisper, panic) For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay! 
His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT. 
BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers are exiting. BUT THEN: 
BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely Against the side of the kneecap. 
PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually coming to rest on: 
BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his hand. "Just found it" expression. 
MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant- types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus with the others. All in silence. 
CUT: 
BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of the passengers impatiently waiting. 
TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, body-searching the male passengers alternately. 
SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards the ramp of the plane. 
BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides to the head of the line. MOVE TO: 
The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into foreground as: 
BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already been searched by the first officer, 
Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp. 
BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting. Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven. 
BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp. 
TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping the ARM. 
TURK (OFF) Just a minute! 
BILLY his eyes flattening. 
SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting. 
BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the: 
FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them. 
SECOND Nebu? Did you search him? 
FIRST OFFICER (frowns) No! 
SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about eighteen. 
SECOND OFFICER (grunts a command, makes a gesture) 
BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips and legs.

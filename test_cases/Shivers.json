{"train": "\"SHIVERS\" \nScreenplay by \nDavid Cronenberg \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. STARLINER TOWERS APARTMENT COMPLEX -- MORNING \nStarliner Towers is seen in LS through the windshield of a moving car. The car approaches the complex and stops near the main doors of the West Tower. \nOut of the car climb Kresimir and Benda Sviben, a gawky newly wed young couple. Kresimir elaborately opens the door for Benda, his new wife, and they walk with hands intertwined up the steps of the West Tower. \nINT. LOBBY -- MORNING \nAs the Svibens approach the main doors, the doorman leaps up from his chair beside the intercom switchboard and opens the door for them. The doorman, like most security guards, does not look capable of handling a serious crisis. He is about fifty, of average height but slightly built, wears thick glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his hip. \nDOORMAN Morning, folks. Can I help you? \nKRESIMIR Yes, please. I... er, we... are looking for the rental agent here. We have an appointment. \nDOORMAN OK, I'll just give him a little buzz and he'll come out and show you the way in. \nThe doorman presses a button on the intercom board. As he turns back to the Svibens, he catches his holster on the board. \nDOORMAN (freeing holster) Darned thing. \nBENDA Do you ever use that? \nDOORMAN This? No, never even had it out of the holster. A rival company has 'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an advertising gimmick. \nINT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nDr. Emil Hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling Annabelle Horsefield. Despite the difference in their sizes -- Annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen -- Hobbes is not having an easy time of it. Hobbes is wearing overlarge blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; Annabelle is in a private girls' school outfit -- white blouse, dark blue tie, blue knee socks, pleated gray skirt. \nAnnabelle fights back fiercely; Hobbes has tears in his eyes. The struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their way to cause a lot of crashing around. At one point Annabelle breaks loose and Hobbes has to chase her. \nAnnabelle slips and Hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, where he has the advantage of leverage. He strangles her quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. Blood oozes from her mouth. Hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something from leaving her body. \nHe reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, and clamps Annabelle's lips together. He then picks up her body, carries it over to the dining-room table and sweeps the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. He then places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins to undress it. \nJANINE (V.O.) Breakfast is just about ready, Nick. \nTudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water- pick until he is completely satisfied. He carefully packs the machine away, then leaves the bathroom. \nIn the dining room, Janine is putting breakfast on the table. Tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. Janine returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee in each hand. She puts one cup in front of Tudor, sits down, starts to drink the other one. After a pause, she speaks. \nJANINE Can I call you at the office? \nTUDOR What do you want to call me at the office for? \nJANINE I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know. \nTUDOR I won't be at the office except to sign in. (he eats heartily, not looking directly at Janine) I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages. (noticing Janine's silence, he finally looks up) I'll come home right after work. \nJanine continues to toy with the food in her plate. She shrugs once, as if to say, 'Big deal, so what?' Tudor ignores her and finishes breakfast. \nINT. A HALLWAY -- MORNING \nTudor leaves his apartment, closing the door behind him (we see the number clearly). \nHe walks down the hallway on automatic pilot, obviously preoccupied, turning the corner leading to the elevators without perceiving what he is seeing. \nAt the elevators he hesitates for a moment, then presses the UP button. When the door opens, he steps in. \nINT. ELEVATOR -- MORNING \nIn the elevator are Merrick, the rental agent, and the Svibens. \nMERRICK We're going up. \nTUDOR Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride. \nMERRICK (after a pause, to the Svibens, indicating the elevator) Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent, fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. Everything you could want in an elevator. \nNobody says another word until the doors spring open and Merrick, after a wink at Tudor, hustles the Svibens out of the elevator. \nAs the doors close, Merrick's voice floats back to Tudor. \nMERRICK (V.O.) Notice how the entranceways to all the apartments are recessed and individually lit... Nope, it's down that way, Brenda. That's it... Recessed and individually lit... \nOnce the door has closed, Tudor presses the button for the top floor. As the elevator ascends, he takes out his wallet and removes a key from a zippered compartment. \nDETECTIVE Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nST. LUC (obviously a bit dazed by what he has been seeing) Sure. \nDETECTIVE You're the one who found the bodies? \nST. LUC Yes. \nDETECTIVE Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here? \nST. LUC No, nothing. \nDETECTIVE You knew these people? \nST. LUC I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic. \nDETECTIVE So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that? \nST. LUC Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today. \nDETECTIVE I see. Then what brought you up here? \nSt. Luc begins to pace about as he talks. \nST. LUC It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come. \nDETECTIVE How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed? \nST. LUC He sounded fine. \nThe telephone rings. The super, who has been fiddling with a window with a cracked pane of glass, grabs the phone instinctively without looking at the detective, who probably would have answered it himself. \nSUPER (pause) Who? No, that's not me. You got the wrong guy. Just a sec. (looks up at St. Luc and holds out the phone to him) It's for you. Somebody wants to know how come you didn't show up for lunch. \nThe detective looks suspiciously at St. Luc, who simply looks dazed. \nINT. ROLLO LINSKY'S LABORATORY -- AFTERNOON \nNext to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. Rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and accessories. \nRollo offers some to St. Luc while stuffing one in his own mouth. There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. Rollo and St. Luc sit around Rollo's desk, a very sleek metal affair. \nHe is now in full flight. He leans over St. Luc and begins to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on St. Luc's stomach with his fingers. St. Luc can't hide his amusement. \nROLLO You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy. \nST. LUC (laughing) It's crazy. \nRollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle. \nROLLO Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready? (leans forward for emphasis) Who cares? \nST. LUC I don't get it. \nROLLO You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects? \nSt. Luc is about to say something, but Rollo answers his own rhetorical question with a flip of the hand, effectively silencing St. Luc. \nROLLO You know who pays the rent here? Eh? The Northern Hemisphere Organ Transplant Society. And that's for something that's supposed to put them outta business. And they're not the only ones. We got grant money coming out of our ears. \nHe leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical journals like the Journal of Venereal Disease, etc. He shoves them under St. Luc's nose, then grabs a jar with a disintegrating octopus-like creature in it and a sandwich at the same time. He smacks down the sandwich in front of St. Luc by mistake, then retrieves it and substitutes the jar with the specimen. \nSt. Luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen. \nAs St. Luc looks at the papers, Rollo breathes heavily down his neck and points out things of interest. \nROLLO See? There? You take a little of this... that's a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic Crinua people, Northeast Asia and Japan. (points to a sexy picture of a Japanese lady in heat) Oo. That one's got it bad. They call it Batinh. That means 'kiss' or 'caress.' When you get it it makes your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss everything. I even had it once. I always get everything at least once so I know what the patient's talking about. (he laughs but he's serious) And there... you take a little of that... that's beautiful, isn't it? That's Flexipes, the world's only cephalopod parasite. (indicating the jar) That's him right there. Not a very good specimen. Related to squids and octopuses. See? He lives in the guts of whales and big dolphins. (wiggles a finger at the specimen) Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't ya? Yeah. \nHe walks away from the desk. His manner is now more subdued and reflective. It seems as though everything he says provokes a dozen unspoken thoughts. His depressive phase is beginning. \nROLLO We don't do it all here, we send out to have tricky stuff done... the cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal fission, all that fancy close work. \nRollo sighs heavily. St. Luc gently shoves all the papers aside. \nST. LUC Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself? \nRollo toys with the gynecological examination table, sliding the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars. \nROLLO (shrugging) Funny in the head. High suicide rate in the medical profession. Too much body, alla time bodies, bodies. \nHe now gets close to St. Luc, putting an arm around his shoulder. \nROLLO Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely. (begins to pace around again) All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation. \nForsythe leaves. Parkins chuckles to himself -- 'still life in the old boy yet' kind of feeling -- and begins to undress. \nINT. TUDOR'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nTudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom, wiping his mouth with a facecloth. He sits down on a chair facing the sliding glass door which leads to the apartment's balcony. \nHe breathes heavily, gasping for air. His expression is a dazed one and he mumbles incoherently. After a moment's rest he rises, opens the glass door, and steps out on to the balcony. \nEXT. TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT \nTudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony, gulping down the air, scanning the lights of the tower opposite. \nSuddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again, his mouth seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle and jawbone, his hands fly up to his mouth in an attempt to keep down whatever is about to come up. \nHanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler in a rough sea, Tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs on for dear life as he retches, gags, moans, and finally vomits. \nEXT. GROUNDS BELOW TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT \nTwo elderly women, Vi and Olive, are taking a leisurely evening stroll at the base of Tudor's tower. They both hold small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly along the path bordering the lawn. \nSuddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited by Tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is heard. A large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a heavy, blood-soaked sponge. The force of the blow almost twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and she gives a little cry of surprise. \nHer companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she sees the blood. \nThe first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not react with such surprise. \nFIRST LADY (examining the bloodied umbrella) Aw. Poor birdie. They're always crashing into tall buildings. It's such a shame, such a shame. The windows fool them, you know. \nThe creature, the second parasite to emerge from Tudor's body, lies in the grass, away from the bright cones of light thrown by the tower's lawn lamps. We can barely make out its bloody, twitching form. \nBeyond the parasite is a basement window through which is visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers. The window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar of laundry soap. \nThe first lady makes a move to find the injured creature, but her companion tightens her grip on the old lady's arm. \nCOMPANION Come along, Olive. \nFIRST LADY Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just been hurt. Maybe we should look for him! \nCOMPANION (pulling Olive along) Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven now, whatever it is. Won't help at all for you to get into a fuss and muddle over it. Now come along and let's finish up our little evening stroll and get you tucked up in bed in front of the color TV. \nThe two women walk off down the path, Vi's voice fading away in the shadows. \nThe first box she tries is empty. She advances to the next and the next, finally finding one that has a jug in it. She takes it and advances to Tudor's box, jug swinging, companion trailing after her in admiration. She stops at Tudor's milk box and flicks the door open. \nShe looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles back in the shadows. Ugh! What's that? \nThe boy takes a look. Inside the box a third parasite can just be seen clinging to a three-quart white plastic milk jug. The jug is smeared with blood. The box's inside door is ajar. The TV set can be heard from inside the apartment. \nBOY I dunno. Guess the milk went bad. (shrugs) It's still worth money. \nThe girl hesitates for a second. Suddenly the parasite twitches around to the front of the jug. The girl, startled, slams the box door shut. \nGIRL Jesus! \nBOY Let's get outta here before somebody hears us! \nThe children run off down the hallway together. After a few seconds, the box door is nudged open again from the inside. \nINT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nJanine sits down in front of the TV set. After a moment or two she gets up, turns the set off, and flops back down on the sofa with her Vogue. \nShe doesn't notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the bedroom to the inside door of the milk box. \nIn the bedroom, a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet to reveal a naked abdomen. It is Tudor's abdomen, and he reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel. \nTudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. He gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears the instant it's touched. \nTUDOR (delirious, voice strained, whispering) Come here, boy. Here, boy, here. \nHe taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers. \nHe is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half-dressed. He looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright. \nTUDOR Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and me, we're gonna be friends, aren't we? \nWe can now see that the sheets are twisted, the pillows half off the bed. Tudor begins drumming on his abdomen. \nGradually, cautiously, the lump under Tudor's skin returns. He tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks back, almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again. \nTudor seems disappointed. \nTUDOR No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm not going to hurt you. Not going to hurt you. We're going to be friends. Friends. \nINT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc sits at his desk and opens Parkins' file. Forsythe, about twenty-three, earthy and humorous, comes in with an armful of papers and records, which she throws in groups on to St. Luc's desk. \nFORSYTHE (distributing papers) OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you. \nST. LUC That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks. \nFORSYTHE Do I get a kiss? \nSt. Luc is absorbed in his papers and doesn't respond. Forsythe prods his shoulder. He looks up at her. \nFORSYTHE Kiss, kiss? \nST. LUC Uh, OK. Sure. \nThey kiss, St. Luc making sure that it doesn't get too heavy. \nFORSYTHE Another kiss? \nST. LUC C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list? \nFORSYTHE No. Dotty's the last. \nThe telephone rings. St. Luc picks it up. \nST. LUC Yes? \nROLLO (V.O.) That you, Rog? \nST. LUC (not recognizing the voice) Yes? \nROLLO (V.O.) It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me? \nST. LUC Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you. \nRealizing that the conversation is likely to be a long one, Forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal locker in the corner, which she opens. \nInside are her street clothes. She begins to take off her nurse's uniform in full view of St. Luc, not being obvious about the distraction she's providing, but not taking pains to hurry dressing or be modest either. \nIn the scene that follows we cut among three basic things: Rollo in his lab, talking and eating; St. Luc in his office, watching Forsythe get undressed and then dressed; and Hobbes's notes and scribblings, which do not necessarily have to be on the screen long enough to be completely read. Hobbes's notes are there more to convince the viewer that they exist and to provide flavor than to transfer information. \nROLLO But the important thing for you is this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a guinea pig. He implanted her with the thing. I figure that once the parasites took, Annabelle went berserk. I dunno what she did, but Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had to kill her. And he wasn't trying to burn her, he was burning them, all of them. \nINT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc watches Forsythe, who is halfway through getting her street clothes on. He toys with the Velakofsky file, which contains abdominal X-rays showing dark, blurred masses inside the abdominal cavity. \nST. LUC He didn't make it. \nROLLO (V.O.) Huh? \nST. LUC Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list. \nINT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT \nROLLO I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys. \nST. LUC (V.O.) I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it? \nROLLO Yeah. (pause) Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things... \nST. LUC (V.O.) (laughing: he doesn't take this aspect too seriously) Yeah? What do I do then? \nROLLO I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them. \nINT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nForsythe has finished dressing and is waiting for St. Luc to get off the phone. \nST. LUC OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly. \nROLLO (V.O.) OK, Rog. See you at ten. \nSt. Luc hangs up. \nFORSYTHE Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper? \nST. LUC Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while. \nFORSYTHE (innocently) Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm. \nSt. Luc pushes his papers aside for a moment and stretches in his swivel chair. \nShe suddenly reaches out and grabs Kurt by his tux with both hands and, with tremendous energy, jerks him back into her apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious kick. \nKurt's cart remains out in the hallway, the food steaming. \nINT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nIn her dining room, Betts mixes herself a drink and checks her watch. She takes a sip, then goes into the bathroom and bends over the bathtub, having balanced her drink on the edge of the tub. \nFrom inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the plug in the plughole. \nBetts turns on the water, adjusting the proportion of hot to cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it, then gets undressed. \nShe wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out to the living room with her drink in hand. In the living room, she arranges her photos in a new order, props them up against the sofa, changes them around again. \nBack in the bathroom, Betts checks the temperature of the water by swishing her hand around in it. The water drums heavily on the floor of the tub. Betts puts her drink on the edge of the tub and turns the water off. \nShe now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the tub. She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her sandals on the bathmat, then picks up her drink and stretches back. She takes a big slug of her drink. Her toes curl in pleasure. \nThe drain plug begins to jerk and twitch, as though something were trying to push it out from inside the drain. \nBetts sinks down in the water until her hair, short as it is, begins to float a bit. \nThe drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until it is pushed right out of its plug hole. The water begins to run out of the drain, but only in a slight trickle -- the drain pipe is blocked by a soft, spongy body. \nBetts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the tub, smiling, relaxed, enjoying the sensation. \nOne of the parasite's stubby tentacles slowly appears, probing out of the drain hole. Then another appears, then another. \nBetts puts down her drink on the tub's edge and reaches for the soap and washcloth. Her eyes are half-closed and a smile still flickers about her lips. The sound of water suddenly rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her reverie. \nShe sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub. The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the tub, almost touching her legs, which are pressed together against one side of the tub. The water is becoming pink with the blood that diffuses through it. \nBetts' mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide. Her reactions are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently had. \nUnder the water, now very shallow, the parasite's tentacles touch Betts's thighs. \nBetts tries to scream but can't. The parasite suckers its way between Betts' thighs. She screams a silent scream in the tub, her mouth wide open, her head rolling from side to side. The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the water and the gurgle of the drain. \nWith a spasm that shakes her whole body, Betts throws her arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and on to the tiles of the bathroom floor. The glass shatters. After a moment or two of further silent struggle, Betts arches her back, then falls into a semi-conscious stupor, slumping motionless in the tub. \nINT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nShe opens the oven door, then takes a bone-handled carving fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a ceramic roasting dish. \nSomeone knocks on the door. Forsythe leaves her oven and goes to answer it, carving fork in hand. \nShe opens the door. Kresimir Sviben stands in the hallway, eyes wide, insane smile on his face. He looks at Forsythe as though she were a piece of steak. \nFORSYTHE Yes? \nKresimir doesn't answer. He begins to drool, his mouth working as though in anticipation of a meal. Forsythe gets a little nervous. \nFORSYTHE Can I... can I help you? \nKresimir approaches. He is visibly shaking. \nKRESIMIR (speaking with difficulty) Yes... you can... help me. \nWithout warning, he lunges for Forsythe, who vainly tries to slam the door in his face. Kresimir pushes his way past the door and grabs Forsythe by the back of the head, trying to kiss her and drooling. \nForsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom, intending to lock herself in. Kresimir throws himself at her legs, managing to grab one of her feet. She doesn't fall, but holds on to a cabinet and tries to pull free. \nKresimir begins to climb up her body. Forsythe, terrified and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder. He screams with pain and loosens his grip on Forsythe long enough for her to pull away, leaving her apron and part of her dress in Kresimir's hands. \nShe runs for the door and is gone. \nKresimir, still on his knees, holds the apron and the piece of dress to his face, breathing in Forsythe's fragrance. He begins to shuffle toward the door on his knees, kissing the clothes in his hands, mumbling and moaning. \nKRESIMIR Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship at the shrine of your body, your body, your body, oh, your body... \nINT. BETTS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nBetts lies slumped in her bathtub, her hair matted and damp, her eyes open and staring. Her mouth begins to work in a very sensual way, and she begins to drool slightly. \nThe tub is completely empty now except for the scum of blood and soap. The smashed glass is scattered all over the floor near the base of the tub. \nZombie-like, Betts rises from the tub and steps out on to the floor, her feet missing the bathmat. The crunch and snap of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom. \nThe steps Betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody prints on the floor. \nBetts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and tubes from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make-up to her face with mechanical precision. \nINT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nThe doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is finally coming down. He stands by, waiting to see who or what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and authoritarian. \nThe doors spring open. Kurt stands at the back of the elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. The girl is finishing the last bit of one of the cr\u00eapes, sucking her fingers deliciously. \nThe mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. She struggles to her feet. Kurt and the girl are ignoring her. \nThe doorman is nonplussed. He hesitates, then makes a move toward the elevator, intending to help the woman to her feet. \nDOORMAN Here, here. What is this all about? What's the matter with you? What are you doing in there? \nThe woman suddenly lunges at the doorman and tries to pull him down. Kurt detaches himself from the girl and joins her. They giggle and drool all over the doorman as they pull him down and pin him to the floor. \nThe daughter, still licking her fingers, slowly approaches the doorman. \nDOORMAN Hey, that's enough, enough of this nonsense! What is this? (Etc.) \nThe daughter kneels at the doorman's feet, then crawls over him, her mouth working, drooling. She lowers her lips over his, Kurt making it impossible for the doorman to move his head out of the way. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nForsythe and St. Luc are hurrying to Forsythe's apartment to see if Kresimir is still there. As they round a corner, they see the Spergazzis coming toward them, the old lady hobbling and hysterical, the old man helping her walk as best he can, trying to maintain some kind of calm. \nWhen Spergazzi sees St. Luc, he lifts his four-pronged cane and waves it around to get attention. \nMR. SPERGAZZI Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help us! \nSt. Luc and Forsythe rush over and help to support the slumping Mrs. Spergazzi. \nST. LUC What happened? \nMR. SPERGAZZI (tipping his hat as he introduces himself even in the midst of chaos) Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm. \nSpergazzi shows St. Luc his wife's forearm, which has been badly burned by the parasite's animal-tissue solvent. As soon as St. Luc starts prodding her arm, Mrs. Spergazzi starts to wail in Italian. Spergazzi tries to soothe her as St. Luc examines her carefully. \nMR. SPERGAZZI It's all right, cara mia. What's one more scar to an old lady, eh? You'll be OK. \nThe old lady wails even more. \nST. LUC Where is this thing that attacked your wife? \nMR. SPERGAZZI I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage. \nJANINE (now in tears) Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this. \nTUDOR Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine... \nJanine hesitantly helps Tudor remove his shirt and begins to caress him in a perfunctory way, tears in her eyes. Her caresses make Tudor moan with pleasure. \nTUDOR Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're my wife. \nJanine's hand sweeps across Tudor's abdomen. She pulls her hand away, startled, obviously having just felt a few of Tudor's lumps. \nShe looks up at Tudor's face with a mixture of horror and wonder in her eyes. Tudor is confused; he doesn't want the caresses to stop. \nTUDOR (pleading) You're my wife, Janine. Please make love to me. \nINT. SPERGAZZI APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nThe Spergazzi apartment is very heavily decorated in the Mediterranean European Catholic style, featuring lots of plastic and plaster Madonnas, calendars with Christ exposing his bleeding heart, etc. \nMrs. Spergazzi lies on an overstuffed couch with her wrist held up for Forsythe to bandage after she coats it with a healing gel. Mrs. Spergazzi wears a suffering-martyr expression. Mr. Spergazzi leans over the back of the couch patting his wife's other hand solicitously. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe steel door at the top of a concrete flight of stairs swings open and St. Luc appears. He quickly negotiates the steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which leads to the incinerator room. \nOnce inside, St. Luc grabs the poker hanging from an iron hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator, slides open the bolt on the door and opens it. \nHe begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven but can't really see very much. He looks around and notices the superintendent's flashlight stuck up on top of a heating pipe. St. Luc takes down the flashlight, switches it on, and continues his search for the dead parasite. \nINT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nTudor lies on top of Janine on their bed. Over his shoulder, Janine's face is visible, eyes wide open and full of tears. She tries to push Tudor away, but he resists. \nJANINE (frantically) No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's stop. I... I want to put my contacts in... I can't see anything... \nTudor pulls her back to him, and finally she is forced to batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of the bed. Tudor glares after her. \nTUDOR (in a mechanical whine) Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me... \nJANINE (trying to buy time) I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK? (pleading with him to believe her) I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? \nTudor's eyes are staring right out of his head and his mouth is wide open. He gasps for breath. He stares at Janine for a second, then buries his face in the blankets, twisting them in his hands and moaning. \nJanine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes through the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJanine runs down a hallway that leads to Betts's apartment, sobbing and stumbling. She gets to Betts's door and opens it without hesitation. \nINT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nJanine enters Betts' apartment. She looks around for Betts. \nJANINE Betts? Betts? It's me. \nShe catches sight of Betts standing out on the balcony, looking across at the North Tower's lights. Betts turns slowly. She is wearing immaculate but very extreme make-up. Janine is slightly taken aback -- it's not Betts' style. \nBetts smiles and opens her arms to Janine. \nINT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT \nRollo puts his jacket on, picks up his doctor's bag and a manila envelope jammed solid with Hobbes's notes, and leaves his lab, turning off the lights and locking the door behind him. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT \nRollo gets into his car, which is parked in a now empty parking lot adjacent to the building in which his lab is situated. His car is large and American and ostentatious, a gold Cadillac Eldorado with options or equivalent. \nThe car pulls out of the lot and on to the street. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nThe doorman, drooling and twitching, locks the exit doors at the end of one hallway. In one hand he holds an enormous pair of cable cutters. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with the poker. Finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered corpse of Spergazzi's parasite. \nDeftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, St. Luc manages to pull the parasite out into the light. Garbage comes rattling down the chute. When St. Luc flashes his light into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of Betts' French food, half-eaten, silver servers and all, the snails being especially prominent. Insane giggles echo down the chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere several floors above. \nSt. Luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the incinerator. The light seems to go right through the parasite, illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, etc. \nAs St. Luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens behind him. A large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and approaches the oblivious St. Luc. \nThe man slips his arms up under St. Luc's arms and kisses him passionately on the neck. As soon as St. Luc realizes what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his elbow and pulls free. \nBetts and Janine are on the sofa, Janine with her head in Betts's lap, Betts rocking Janine like a child. \nJANINE (sobbing) Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so hideous. Everything dies and rots and disappears. I'm going to die, and you're going to die, and Nick... \nShe breaks down. \nBetts is drowsy-eyed and smiling. She strokes Janine's hair. \nBETTS There, there, there. It all gets sorted out in the genes and chromosomes. It's not for us to think about at all. It's not our problem at all, 'Nine. We're just here to exist and to have a good time. Exist and have a good time. (pause) Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel good to you? \nJanine's eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks, but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed. \nJANINE Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. \nBETTS (casually, as though it were the most ordinary request in the world) Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. \nJanine twists around and looks up at Betts. There is something in Betts' tone -- quite apart from what she is saying -- that disturbs her, something that reminds her of her husband. \nJANINE Betts! You can't really be saying that! You just can't! \nBetts smiles drowsily. She bends over Janine, turning her head in her hands until they face each other. Betts lowers her face toward Janine. Janine is wide-eyed, almost hypnotized by Betts's strength, smile, and confidence. \nBETTS Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 'Nine? \nJanine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on Janine's. After a pause, Betts suddenly opens her mouth wide and presses her lips savagely against Janine's. \nShe holds Janine's head firmly as they kiss. Janine struggles for a moment, then opens her mouth as well. \nHer eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth. The parasite begins to force its way into Janine's mouth and down her throat. Janine gags and tries to pull away, but too late. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nForsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator and pulls open the steel door at the bottom. She begins to look around for St. Luc. \nFORSYTHE Roger? Roger, are you here? \nShe suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has killed. She actually has to break her fall with her hands, which slip in the man's blood. Horrified, she gets up and backs away. \nThe sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from everywhere. Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. She tugs on the handle and it opens. \nINT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT \nThe young couple turn to look at him. Suddenly, three more residents, two women and a man, all of them half naked, jump down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets. The residents begin to kiss and paw the couple. Merrick wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself on top of the writhing mass. \nINT. GARAGE -- NIGHT \nFinding herself in the underground garage, Forsythe decides to get in her car and drive out. She finds her car -- a Datsun or Toyota -- gets in, throws the doctor's bag in the back, and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors. \nThe car rolls over the cable which normally activates the doors, but nothing happens. Forsythe puts the car in reverse and backs over the cable, but still nothing happens. She sits with the car idling, trying to figure out what to do next. \nSuddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her. \nThe doorman forces her down across the front seats of the car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes to shreds. He gradually forces himself between her legs. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for Forsythe. He sees immediately that she is not there, but also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the garage. \nHe opens the garage door. Forsythe's screams come echoing through the garage. \nINT. GARAGE -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc races through the garage, trying to find Forsythe. He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and runs over to it. \nThe doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster and begins smashing away at the doorman with it. \nThe doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow. \nThe doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe. \nSt. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman. \nSt. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, toward the garage door. \nAnother car full of residents suddenly careens in front of the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, who are emerging from their car. \nOne of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the other two. \nSt. Luc drags Forsythe out of the car, throws her over his shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door leading to the incinerator. \nINT. HALLWAYS -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc half drags, half carries Forsythe along hallways whose doors are wide open. From the apartments issues the entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds -- giggles, moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks. \nROLLO Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't hurt. \nTudor's abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn back. Crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged blood parasites, which sits poised for only a fraction of a second before it springs at Rollo's face with great energy. \nAs the thing hits Rollo's face it locks on to his head by entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching its suckers to his cheeks and chin. \nRollo tries to stand, then staggers and falls. The thing tries to force its way into Rollo's mouth, cutting his lips in the process. They bleed furiously. When Rollo manages to pull a sucker away, a piece of his flesh comes with it. \nAs he writhes on the carpeted floor, two more parasites appear crawling toward him from under the bed, covered with dust from the floor. They clamber on to him and fasten on to his face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. Rollo screams in pain. \nHe manages to roll to his feet. He staggers out of the darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still locked on to his face. They try to pull his lips apart, but he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing their way into the depths of his body. \nHe takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. With a sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment on to the sink. \nHis hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by Tudor weeks ago. Rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites from his face with their steel jaws. The parasites, swollen with Tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them apart. \nIn the bedroom, Tudor's eyes snap open. His head rises from the pillow. \nHe swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream. He begins to mumble. \nTUDOR No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't. You mustn't kill them, no, no, no. \nThen, as though listening to himself and suddenly understanding what he is saying, he rises to his feet shakily and walks to the kitchen. He stops at the kitchen door. \nRollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding away at them in the kitchen sink. The parasites wriggle and curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at them with the pliers. \nTudor staggers toward Rollo. \nTUDOR No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's my blood you're spilling! My blood! Let them come home, let them come home, home, home inside me. Don't kill them...! \nHe starts to paw Rollo, feebly trying to prevent him from further mutilating the parasites. He reaches over St. Luc's shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites. \nTUDOR (whining pitifully) At least save me one! For God's sake! At least save me one. One, one, one, one... \nRollo turns as Tudor begins to shove the piece of flesh back down his throat. \nAs Rollo turns we see that bits of tentacles and suckers are still attached to his cheeks, throat, forehead. His face is melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the corrosive fluid on one side. He stares in rage at Tudor. \nWith a scream, Rollo strikes Tudor with the pliers. Tudor falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. Rollo drops the pliers on the floor. \nHe stares at Tudor in shock. His face is reflected in a copper frying pan hanging over the stove. Noticing the reflection, Rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. He gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering and moaning. \nINT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nAs St. Luc begins to ascend the stairs, we can see tiny black hooks tearing through Forsythe's gag. Blood begins to soak through from the inside. \nA group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing above St. Luc and, noticing them, begin to walk down the steps, moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures toward the pair. \nBlood is now pouring from Forsythe's mouth and tentacles are groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin. \nSt. Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main doors. \nAs he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss him, caress him, pull his clothes off. They finally manage to drag Forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him as they do so. St. Luc tries to prop her up on her feet, but she's completely limp. St. Luc holds Forsythe against the stairway wall as residents mill all about them. He looks at her in sudden hopelessness. \nST. LUC (shouting) Forsythe! Forsythe! \nThe parasite is now half out of her mouth, hanging through the slit it has torn in her gag. \nSt. Luc lets go of Forsythe and she sinks to the floor. The residents are swarming all over them. St. Luc abandons Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs. \nHe runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, until he is free of the slow-moving residents. He leans back against a wall, panting. \nCrooning and moaning echo up to him from below. He leans over the railing and looks down. \nIn the stairwell several flights below, Forsythe lies surrounded by milling residents, legs spread as though about to give birth. A resident leans over and pulls the parasite from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. Other residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though offering her a strange kind of comfort. \nSt. Luc reels with disgust and disbelief. He turns and runs. \nINT. SWIMMING POOL -- NIGHT \nBetween the two towers lies the swimming pool. St. Luc manages to reach the door leading from the South Tower into the pool. He hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in near exhaustion, then opens it and enters. \nThe pool is dim and tranquil. Two women are swimming in the deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal. \nSt. Luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent normalcy of the scene. Then he staggers forward, calling out to the swimmers. \nST. LUC Have you seen the police? I'm Dr. St. Luc. Have you seen the police? Have they come? \nThe swimmers both flick playfully beneath the water's surface. St. Luc approaches the water's edge, waiting for them to surface. The water ripples and bubbles near his feet. A sinking feeling comes over him. He watches in horrible fascination. He begins to shiver. \nThe ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. After a pause, Janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. A few seconds later, Betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery calm. Betts gestures to St. Luc to join them in the pool. \nSt. Luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool. \n", "test1_input": "JANINE You say something? \nTUDOR Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all. \nJanine waits for Tudor to say something else. He ignores her. \nJANINE (after a pause) You sure you're OK, Nick? \nTudor continues to ignore her. Janine sighs in a very obvious way and disappears. Tudor waits for a second, turns off the water-pick, then checks out his stomach again. \nINT. WOMEN'S SAUNA -- AFTERNOON \nJanine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head and middle. Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior and has never known independence. \nThey are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other two full-bodied women. \nBetts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's disease. \nBETTS ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor? \nJANINE He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors. \nBETTS Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... (pauses to work it out) ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. \nJANINE (not displeased with the idea) He'll be really mad. \nBETTS (with a conspiratorial smile) So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change. \nShe stretches out full length on the bench, her toes bumping Benda's thigh. Betts notices Benda for the first time. \nBETTS (to Benda) Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you here before, have I? \nBenda draws her towel around her, wide-eyed, completely intimidated by Betts. She manages a nervous smile. \nINT. TUDOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nTudor's secretary, a lumpy and motherly lady named Mrs. Wheatley -- she has a nameplate on her desk -- is shuffling some papers when the telephone rings. \nHer small cubicle of an office is appended to Tudor's only slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building. The door leading to Tudor's office is closed. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals. Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll buzz him. \n", "test1_true": "MRS. WHEATLEY I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll put you on 'hold' again and see if I can find Mr. Tudor. \nMrs. Wheatley pushes the 'hold' button and gets out of her chair. She knocks gently on the door. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas? There's a call for you. \nPerplexed by Tudor's failure to respond, Mrs. Wheatley gingerly opens the door. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas? It's that man whose Lamborghini caught fire on St. Catherine Street and burned to the ground. He's very angry... \nShe catches a glimpse of Tudor rolling around on the floor behind his desk, his swivel chair tipped over on to its side. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas! What happened? \nShe rushes over to Tudor and helps him to his feet. Tudor is breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on the desk while Mrs. Wheatley straightens up the chair for him. \nTudor collapses into the chair, mumbling and rolling his head from side to side. Mrs. Wheatley pulls a Kleenex from her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming from one corner of Tudor's mouth. \nMRS. WHEATLEY We're going to get you to a hospital. That's what we're going to do. \nTUDOR (beginning to come around) No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all right. \nMrs. Wheatley shows Tudor the spot of blood on her Kleenex. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Do you see this? This is blood. It came from your insides. That means it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You executives are all the same. \nTudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk, still pretty wobbly. \nMRS. WHEATLEY (smoothing the hair back from Tudor's forehead in a very motherly fashion) Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost anything to be sure everything's all right. I think you should definitely go to the emergency ward and... \nTUDOR (abruptly, swiveling away from Mrs. Wheatley's hand) Call me a cab, will you please, Mona? I'm going home for the day. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas, I think... \nTUDOR I don't care what you think. Please call me a cab. Now. \nMrs. Wheatley steps away from the desk, obviously hurt by Tudor's brusqueness. \nMRS. WHEATLEY (mollifyingly) All right, Nicholas. All right. \n", "test2_input": "She leaves, closing the door behind her. \nTudor sighs, taking a deep breath. He is suddenly hit by another twinge of pain. He clutches his stomach. Blood trickles out of the corner of his mouth. After a pause, he licks the blood off his lips with the tip of his tongue. \nINT. CLINIC RECEPTION AT STARLINER TOWERS -- AFTERNOON \nThe Starliner Towers Medical Clinic is small but complete. Dr. St. Luc and his nurse, Forsythe, are backed up by a secretary-receptionist who sits behind a desk surrounded by filing cabinets at the end of the hallway which serves as reception area. There are chairs lined up against one wall, flanked by coffee tables piled high with the traditional two- year-old magazines. \nThree or four people sit waiting to see St. Luc, among them the aging but sprightly Mr. Parkins and Janine Tudor. Parkins, who considers himself something of a ladies' man, is talking to Janine when St. Luc appears and looks at the list of patients who have signed in. \nPARKINS ...and this Kriedler seems to think that mega-vitamin therapy may be the answer to the question of aging. That's not to suggest that the aging process is in any way reversible -- I don't think for a minute that it is -- but it may be stoppable, and that's where mega-vitamins come in... \nSt. Luc gestures to Janine to follow him into his office. Janine gets up, excusing herself to Mr. Parkins. \nJANINE Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go. \nShe follows St. Luc into his office. He closes the door behind her. \nINT. TAXICAB -- AFTERNOON \nThe cab carrying Tudor pulls up at the main doors of the Towers. Tudor, still a bit unsteady, signs a chit for the driver and gets out of the car. \nINT. LOBBY -- AFTERNOON \nThe doorman opens both doors for Tudor as he enters the building. \nDOORMAN Afternoon, Mr. Tudor. \nINT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nJanine sits opposite St. Luc, who has a file open before him on his desk. \nST. LUC Well, there's certainly nothing here in this check-up I did for your husband's company last year. Blood pressure a touch high, cholesterol count nice and low... (looking Janine in the eye) I just can't see cancer developing that fast, Janine, not the way you've described it. Could be swollen glands or something, I don't know. \nJANINE (a bit relieved but still tense) You'll come up and take a look at him? \nST. LUC (standing up) If he can't make it down here... sure. That's what I'm here for. But it won't be until, oh... (checking his watch) ...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late? \nJanine smiles and shakes her head. Just gotta have time to put the clinic to bed for the night and grab some supper. \nJANINE That's great, Doctor. Thanks. \n", "test2_true": "St. Luc keeps staring at Tudor's file, shifts something from one side of the folder to the other. Something bothers him. \nThe door to one of the examination rooms opens and Forsythe pops her head around the corner. \nFORSYTHE Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor. \nST. LUC Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec. \nForsythe disappears. St. Luc studies Tudor's file. \nINT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON \nTudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attach\u00e9 case on to a chair. He loosens his tie and makes himself a drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the TV set. \nAfter only a short moment of relative calm, Tudor suddenly contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to the floor. He rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension. \nHe soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm of pain apparently over. He keeps both hands clamped over his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom. \nOnce in the bathroom, Tudor throws himself over the side of the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the tub itself. \nHe gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on the floor, mouth bloody. In the tub, a trail of blood-streaked slime leads into the drain. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON \nForsythe comes out to the reception area from an examination room, checks out the patient list, and beckons to Mr. Parkins. \nFORSYTHE I'm ready for you now, Brad. \nParkins gets up and follows Forsythe into one of the examination rooms. \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON \nOnce inside the examination room, Forsythe closes the door and hands Parkins a hospital tunic. \nFORSYTHE Now, you just take off all your clothes, put this on, and hop up on to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll be in to see you in a few minutes. \nPARKINS (as Forsythe begins to leave) You don't have to go. I'm not shy. \nFORSYTHE Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still working, you know. \n", "test3_input": "ST. LUC (handing Parkins a slip of paper) I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology. \nPARKINS Gonna cut me open? \nST. LUC Well, let's wait for the X-rays. \nPARKINS Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did. (chuckles) Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that. \nSt. Luc smiles politely, his mind obviously elsewhere. \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nA bar of laundry soap props open the window of the laundry room. The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of wall immediately below the window. \nThe hand of an old woman, puckered and wrinkled from many hours submerged in hot soapy water, reaches up, and yanks the bar of soap out of the jaws of the window. The window swing shut. The woman's hand slides the bolt home, locking the window from the inside. \nThe old woman is short, dumpy, puffy-faced, in her late sixties. Her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her head. \nShe sniffles, shakes her head, turns away from the window, and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and dryers. As she walks she has to thread her way among the dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry -- against apartment regulations, she takes in outsiders' laundry -- which she has brought down the elevator with her. \nShe flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig clothes out of the nearest shopping bag. \nFrom above and behind the washer, we watch her fill the machine and reach into the front of her dress, which is black and frayed. After feeling around for a few seconds, she pulls out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent. She dumps some of this into the washer, finds the appropriate coins in the pocket of her dress, and starts the machine. \nShe watches it for a second to make sure it's working properly, then puts the plastic bag back where she found it. She picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in her ragged slippers to the next washer. She stops in front of it and puts down the bag. \nThe old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of the washer. She grimaces, grabs a sock from the bag and cleans off the top of the washer with it. She tosses the sock into the washer and leans over the hole, trying to see inside. \nThe parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly springs from the opening on to the old woman's face, suckering on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles. She shrieks and grabs at the creature with both hands, trying to pull it off. \nShe stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over various shopping bags. Finally she goes down amidst her laundry, thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere. \nINT. STARLINER TOWERS GROCERY STORE -- NIGHT \nIn the grocery store built into the base of one of the towers, Janine flips through some magazines, finally buying a Vogue. \nShe stops to look at several shelves of various kinds of food, picking up this and that, but somehow the thought of cooking or even eating repulses her, and she leaves without buying anything but the magazine. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJanine walks along a hallway, stops at a door, knocks gently, and then opens the door and walks in, obviously very familiar with the occupant. \n", "test3_true": "Janine enters Betts' apartment. Betts is sitting cross-legged in leotards on the broadloom, a number of very large black- and-white photographs spread out in front of her. As she speaks to Janine, she arranges and rearranges them. \nOther equipment and graphics of various kinds stuck on walls, hidden in corners and lying on chairs and tables suggest that Betts is in advertising and commercial graphics. \nJanine stands halfway in the door. \nJANINE Hi. \nBETTS Hi. Want a drink? \nJANINE No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so. \nBETTS Was he nice to you? \nJanine nods. \nBETTS Good. Well... (takes a sip from a glass on the floor next to her) I've ordered in some vrai cuisine fran\u00e7aise from Jean-Phillipe at the C\u00f4te d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in garlic butter... the works. They have lovely strong delivery boys who fight their way through sleet and hail and the gloom of night just to bring me my coq au vin. And after Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's nothing wrong with Nick that a vacation won't cure, and if Nick falls asleep early again, you just come on back here for company and a late supper. You hear me? \nJanine nods. \nBETTS Now, I mean it. I always order enough for two and I'll just get fat and lonely if you don't show up. \nJanine wiggles her fingers goodbye and leaves. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJanine walks down the hallway to her apartment, her Vogue rolled up under her arm. She opens the door to her apartment -- it's not locked -- and goes in. \nA moment after she's gone and closed the door, two children about ten years old appear around a corner, giggling and jostling each other. They approach Tudor's apartment. \nGIRL C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it. \nBOY I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead. \nGIRL OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself. \nBOY Buy 'em with what, dumbhead? \nGIRL (flipping open a milk box) With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home. \n"}

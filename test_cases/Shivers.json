{"test1_input": "JANINE You say something? \nTUDOR Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all. \nJanine waits for Tudor to say something else. He ignores her. \nJANINE (after a pause) You sure you're OK, Nick? \nTudor continues to ignore her. Janine sighs in a very obvious way and disappears. Tudor waits for a second, turns off the water-pick, then checks out his stomach again. \nINT. WOMEN'S SAUNA -- AFTERNOON \nJanine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head and middle. Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior and has never known independence. \nThey are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other two full-bodied women. \nBetts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's disease. \nBETTS ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor? \nJANINE He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors. \nBETTS Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... (pauses to work it out) ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. \nJANINE (not displeased with the idea) He'll be really mad. \nBETTS (with a conspiratorial smile) So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change. \nShe stretches out full length on the bench, her toes bumping Benda's thigh. Betts notices Benda for the first time. \nBETTS (to Benda) Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you here before, have I? \nBenda draws her towel around her, wide-eyed, completely intimidated by Betts. She manages a nervous smile. \nINT. TUDOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nTudor's secretary, a lumpy and motherly lady named Mrs. Wheatley -- she has a nameplate on her desk -- is shuffling some papers when the telephone rings. \nHer small cubicle of an office is appended to Tudor's only slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building. The door leading to Tudor's office is closed. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals. Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll buzz him. \n", "test1_true": "MRS. WHEATLEY I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll put you on 'hold' again and see if I can find Mr. Tudor. \nMrs. Wheatley pushes the 'hold' button and gets out of her chair. She knocks gently on the door. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas? There's a call for you. \nPerplexed by Tudor's failure to respond, Mrs. Wheatley gingerly opens the door. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas? It's that man whose Lamborghini caught fire on St. Catherine Street and burned to the ground. He's very angry... \nShe catches a glimpse of Tudor rolling around on the floor behind his desk, his swivel chair tipped over on to its side. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas! What happened? \nShe rushes over to Tudor and helps him to his feet. Tudor is breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on the desk while Mrs. Wheatley straightens up the chair for him. \nTudor collapses into the chair, mumbling and rolling his head from side to side. Mrs. Wheatley pulls a Kleenex from her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming from one corner of Tudor's mouth. \nMRS. WHEATLEY We're going to get you to a hospital. That's what we're going to do. \nTUDOR (beginning to come around) No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all right. \nMrs. Wheatley shows Tudor the spot of blood on her Kleenex. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Do you see this? This is blood. It came from your insides. That means it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You executives are all the same. \nTudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk, still pretty wobbly. \nMRS. WHEATLEY (smoothing the hair back from Tudor's forehead in a very motherly fashion) Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost anything to be sure everything's all right. I think you should definitely go to the emergency ward and... \nTUDOR (abruptly, swiveling away from Mrs. Wheatley's hand) Call me a cab, will you please, Mona? I'm going home for the day. \nMRS. WHEATLEY Nicholas, I think... \nTUDOR I don't care what you think. Please call me a cab. Now. \nMrs. Wheatley steps away from the desk, obviously hurt by Tudor's brusqueness. \nMRS. WHEATLEY (mollifyingly) All right, Nicholas. All right. \n", "test1_id": 1869, "test2_input": "Betts and Janine are on the sofa, Janine with her head in Betts's lap, Betts rocking Janine like a child. \nJANINE (sobbing) Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so hideous. Everything dies and rots and disappears. I'm going to die, and you're going to die, and Nick... \nShe breaks down. \nBetts is drowsy-eyed and smiling. She strokes Janine's hair. \nBETTS There, there, there. It all gets sorted out in the genes and chromosomes. It's not for us to think about at all. It's not our problem at all, 'Nine. We're just here to exist and to have a good time. Exist and have a good time. (pause) Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel good to you? \nJanine's eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks, but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed. \nJANINE Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. \nBETTS (casually, as though it were the most ordinary request in the world) Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. \nJanine twists around and looks up at Betts. There is something in Betts' tone -- quite apart from what she is saying -- that disturbs her, something that reminds her of her husband. \nJANINE Betts! You can't really be saying that! You just can't! \nBetts smiles drowsily. She bends over Janine, turning her head in her hands until they face each other. Betts lowers her face toward Janine. Janine is wide-eyed, almost hypnotized by Betts's strength, smile, and confidence. \nBETTS Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 'Nine? \nJanine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on Janine's. After a pause, Betts suddenly opens her mouth wide and presses her lips savagely against Janine's. \nShe holds Janine's head firmly as they kiss. Janine struggles for a moment, then opens her mouth as well. \nHer eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth. The parasite begins to force its way into Janine's mouth and down her throat. Janine gags and tries to pull away, but too late. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nForsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator and pulls open the steel door at the bottom. She begins to look around for St. Luc. \nFORSYTHE Roger? Roger, are you here? \nShe suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has killed. She actually has to break her fall with her hands, which slip in the man's blood. Horrified, she gets up and backs away. \nThe sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from everywhere. Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. She tugs on the handle and it opens. \nINT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "The agent looks perfectly normal, though he keeps wiping his mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand. \nMERRICK ...haven't seen anything that looks like trouble at all. Just filling in for Walter... the doorman. But if you want me to call the police, I will. \nSt. Luc is cautious but he seems to believe Merrick. He presses the button which buzzes the Spergazzi apartment. Nobody answers. A middle-aged man walks in. Worried, St. Luc buzzes again. \nMAN Apartment 307? Visiting my sister. \nMerrick smiles and opens the door for the man, who goes in and takes the stairway up, preferring to walk. \nThe intercom squawks and Spergazzi answers the buzzer. \nMR. SPERGAZZI Yes? Who is there? \nST. LUC It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please. \nMR. SPERGAZZI (V.O.) Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you. \nSt. Luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the door. Merrick smiles and pulls it open for him. St. Luc disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator. \nAs the stairway doors close, the elevators slide open and a young couple come out heading for the main doors, dressed to go out to a late party. \nBefore they reach the doors, Merrick slips through them and meets the couple in the lobby. He smiles broadly as he approaches them. \nMERRICK Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I wonder if I could talk to you for a second in my office? \nMISS LEWIS Why don't you do something about all that noise? We like parties, but this is ridiculous. \nMERRICK Well, there may be a connection. See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid somebody busted into it tonight. \nMISS LEWIS AND MR WOLF (together) Oh, no! What a drag! \nMERRICK 'Fraid so. I've got a few of the things they threw around in my office and if you could identify it... \nThe couple turn, grumbling, and walk toward Merrick's office. Merrick follows, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \nINT. RENTAL OFFICE -- NIGHT \nThe young couple enter the rental office, Merrick following close behind. Once they are all in, Merrick closes the door. He rests against the door and drools copiously, then giggles. \n", "test2_id": 1870, "test3_input": "The young couple turn to look at him. Suddenly, three more residents, two women and a man, all of them half naked, jump down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets. The residents begin to kiss and paw the couple. Merrick wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself on top of the writhing mass. \nINT. GARAGE -- NIGHT \nFinding herself in the underground garage, Forsythe decides to get in her car and drive out. She finds her car -- a Datsun or Toyota -- gets in, throws the doctor's bag in the back, and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors. \nThe car rolls over the cable which normally activates the doors, but nothing happens. Forsythe puts the car in reverse and backs over the cable, but still nothing happens. She sits with the car idling, trying to figure out what to do next. \nSuddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her. \nThe doorman forces her down across the front seats of the car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes to shreds. He gradually forces himself between her legs. \nINT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for Forsythe. He sees immediately that she is not there, but also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the garage. \nHe opens the garage door. Forsythe's screams come echoing through the garage. \nINT. GARAGE -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc races through the garage, trying to find Forsythe. He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and runs over to it. \nThe doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster and begins smashing away at the doorman with it. \nThe doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow. \nThe doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe. \nSt. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman. \nSt. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, toward the garage door. \nAnother car full of residents suddenly careens in front of the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, who are emerging from their car. \nOne of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the other two. \nSt. Luc drags Forsythe out of the car, throws her over his shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door leading to the incinerator. \nINT. HALLWAYS -- NIGHT \nSt. Luc half drags, half carries Forsythe along hallways whose doors are wide open. From the apartments issues the entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds -- giggles, moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks. \n", "test3_true": "INT. GYM -- NIGHT \nThe door to the gym opens and St. Luc looks in cautiously. The gym is quite tiny and is deserted. St. Luc pulls Forsythe in and closes the door. He lays Forsythe down on a gym mat and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight- lifting table. \nHe kneels beside Forsythe, who seems to be only just regaining consciousness. St. Luc strokes her face, pushes strands of hair matted with blood out of her eyes. \nST. LUC (more to himself than Forsythe) Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be here soon. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT \nRollo's car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a blatantly illegal space. He flips up a card on the dash which says 'M.D. ON CALL,' then gets out of the car. \nHe walks up the steps and through the main doors, which are wide open. Nobody is in sight. \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nRollo walks along the hallway, bag in hand, envelope under arm. He stops in front of Tudor's door, checks the number against the number written in his notebook, then knocks on the door. \nNobody answers. He knocks once more, then looks around shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in. \nINT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nRollo enters and closes the door behind him, deliberately slamming it. He walks into the center of the living room and bellows. \nROLLO Hello, good evening, is anybody here? Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to see you for consultation. \nStill no answer. Rollo is puzzled. He snoops around the apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half closed. He pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually. \nROLLO It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home? \nRollo can now see the figure of Tudor lying in bed in the dim light of the bedroom. Rollo enters the bedroom. \nROLLO Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr. Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here. He must be a little bit late. \nTudor does not answer, does not move. He lies stiffly on the bed on his back, mouth insanely agape, eyes shut, covers half on the floor. \nROLLO Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a look at you? \nHe stands at the edge of the bed, peering at Tudor, looking for signs of consciousness. After a pause, he kneels on the bed and slowly draws back the covers. \n", "test3_id": 1871}

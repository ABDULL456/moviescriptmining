Kit begins backing out of the room. 
KIT (cont'd) Take care of you, okay?  Take care of you.  Love ya... 
Kit turns and hurries out of the apartment. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY 
Kit enters the falafel stand on Hollywood Boulevard. 
INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY 
Kit enters, sits at the counter. 
KIT Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a grilled cheese on white, okay? 
A very young GIRL is sitting just down the counter from Kit. Kit nods at her. 
KIT Hey, how you doin'.  You new, huh? 
GIRL Yeah.  Got a cigarette? 
KIT Sure. 
She passes the girl down the pack.  She strikes a match, lights her cigarette for her.  The girl inhales deep, lets it out with a sigh.  She looks towards the window. 
GIRL Jeez, did the wacko in the suit. 
Kit turns to look. 
KIT'S P.O.V. - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. 
Outside, across the street, Edward has accosted two PROSTITUTES; one blonde, one a red haired black one. 
INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY - BACK TO SCENE 
Kit rises. 
KIT Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm, I'll be back. 
She heads out the door. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY 
Edward is still talking to the prostitutes. 
EDWARD I'm looking for a girl, Vivian, young, dark hair, big eyes...? 
They shake their heads. 
EDWARD She's mouthy.  Sort of difficult...? 
PROSTITUTE 1 Ain't seen her, wouldn't know her. 
PROSTITUTE 2 What's wrong with us, man?  Two for the price a one, what ya say? 
EDWARD (disappointed) Thank you.  No. 
They turn and walk away.  Edward stands there, not knowing what to do next.  He looks discouraged and lost. 
KIT (O.S.) Edward Harris, as I live and breathe! 
Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him.  Kit smiles, triumphantly. 
KIT (cont'd) Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she said. 
She turns and starts away.  She stops, turns back. 
KIT (cont'd) You comin' or not?  I don't got all day, I got a grilled cheese waitin'. 
Edward follows Kit. 
INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought.  Her bags are packed, ready to go.  With a sigh she rises.  She picks up the bags, exits the room. 
Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time.  She suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving.  She musters resolve.  She goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her. Silence.  Vivian suddenly comes back in.  She puts down her bags.  She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into it, places it back where Kit will find it. 
She turns and starts again for the door. 
She stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her imagination.  She hurries over to the window.

During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) It's no big deal. Come on. 
He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom. 
He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Come on, darling. It's nothing serious. Things like that happen.. 
ANNE (SOBBING) I can't... take it any more. 
He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling helpless. 
GEORGES My love. My darling. 
SCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair beside the bed. 
EVA ... thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block. If inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing. Right now, savings accounts pay 1.75% at best. Four years ago, Geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed. So now we're obviously worried. Unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof. Since we came back from Scandinavia, I spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads. 
To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds: 
EVA (CONT'D) It takes time, that's all. We'll find something in the end. 
Another oppressive PAUSE. 
ANNE (slowly) Yes yes I have... I have... the grandmother... woman with house... not... the house then ... money 
EVA I don't understand you, I'm afraid. 
ANNE ... yes... now... it's all... house sel... sel... sel... was... in two strokes of... so quickly... god it's hard... to say... sell... money gone... left... there too... 
PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes. 
SCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks with a British accent. 
GEORGES ... three times a week... I'm not experienced enough. We'll see if that's enough. 
GEOFF How much is she asking? 
GEORGES It's paid by the hour. We'll see.

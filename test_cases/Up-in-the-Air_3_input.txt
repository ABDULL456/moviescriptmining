Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing" 
PURSER Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make. 
Passengers look up. 
PURSER (CONT'D) Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit TEN... MILLION... MILES... 
RYAN Oh no... 
The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne. 
Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned. 
The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the Chief Pilot from the commercial. 
MAYNARD FINCH (TO RYAN) That seat taken? 
Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then slides by Ryan to the window seat. 
MAYNARD FINCH You're the youngest yet to hit twenty mil. Don't know where you found the time... (REMEMBERS) Oh right, here you go. 
Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been stamped from platinum. 
MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D) Seventh card we've made. Small club. We really appreciate your loyalty. 
It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection. 
RYAN You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here. 
MAYNARD FINCH Really? What did you want to say? 
A long beat. 
RYAN You know, I... I can't remember. 
MAYNARD FINCH That's alright. Happens to all of us. (attempts chit chat) So, where you from? 
Ryan looks at him straight in the face. 
RYAN I'm from here. 
INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - NEXT DAY 
Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back. 
AIRLINE OPERATOR Hello, Mr. Bingham. 
RYAN Oh, how did you know it was me? 
AIRLINE OPERATOR This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers. 
RYAN Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller? 
AIRLINE OPERATOR Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer? 
RYAN How many miles would it take to circle the globe? 
AIRPORT OPERATOR We have our "around-the-world" tickets. They're five hundred thousand miles each. 
RYAN Sounds perfect. 
Craig enters Ryan's doorway. 
CRAIG GREGORY Got a second? 
RYAN (to the airline operator) I'm going to have to call you right back. 
Craig takes a seat across from Ryan. 
CRAIG GREGORY What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to reach you all day. 
RYAN I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on? 
An uncomfortable beat. 
CRAIG GREGORY Do you remember Karen Barnes? 
Ryan doesn't. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) She was part of a thirty person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita. Natalie fired her. 
RYAN No, I fire dozens of people a day.

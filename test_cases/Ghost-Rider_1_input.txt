A HAND slips under the body of the car.Butit's not a human hand. It's the hand of a beast -- blackandtwisted, taloned. With a sudden movement, the hand flipsthecar up, sending the enter vehicle spiraling into theair.The Boy lies there, exposed like a bug beneath an upturned rock. He looks up -- 
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) And what seems like cruel fate is really only Nature, red in tooth and claw. 
THE BOY'S POV We see a BRIEF FLASH of Starke. No longer a human silhouette, but a SNARLING, lupine beast. The Trickster. The Black Dog. Rushing towards us with open jaws as we -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BADLANDS - DAWN 
A HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti. 
INT. HUMMER - DAWN 
Carrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips. 
ODELL Want some food, kid? Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag. 
ODELL (CONT'D) C'mon. Eat a chip or something. 
CARRIGAN She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up and get some sleep. 
ODELL I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd 
BURNING -- (shaking his head) -- Christ. 
CARRIGAN Just put it out of your head. 
ODELL If I could put it out of my head, I wouldn't be awake now, would I? Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape. 
CARRIGAN Look out there, what do you see? 
LANDSDALE Dick. 
CARRIGAN That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers. 
(CAN":NC,'.-) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDSDALE (nodding, eyes closed) Probe you in the ass, they get the chance. 
ODELL What's your point, Mr. Serling? 
CARRIGAN My point is; everybody's seen somethina. Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever -- 
ODELL This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see what it did to Albright? Punched his head clean off! 
CARRIGAN Look, I don't know what that thing was. All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him. We were told we'd see things and we were told to look the other way. You want to cut out? I'll pull over right here. 
LANDSDALE Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come this far just to limp home with nothing. Right, Odell? Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy. 
ODELL I guess. But I'd still like to know what that thing was. 
RAIN He's the Ghost Rider. Everybody looks at her. It's the first thing she's said. 
CARRIGAN 
(CHUCKLING) "The Ghost Rider"? Get that off the back of an Oakridge Boys album or something? You think that shit scares me? 
RAIN It should. He's going to kill you all. 
ODELL 
(FREAKING OUT) See? SiE? ! 
(MORE) (CO.JT N =i) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ODELL (CONT' D) That's what I'm talking about! Fucking Chatty Cathy sitting back here with me! Carrigan glances in the rear-view mirror, makes eye-contact with Rain, does his level-best not to be spooked.

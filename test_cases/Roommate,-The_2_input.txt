STEPHEN Your door was open. 
SARA Oh my God. 
STEPHEN Sorry. Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck. 
STEPHEN What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this? 
SARA That's what I intend to find out. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 
Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around. Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks up and we see what she's been staring at: Irene. 
INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer. Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry. 
SARA 
(READING) APD -- anti-social personality disorder. Also known as sociopathy. They look at each other. 
STEPHEN Jesus. I thought she was just weird. 
SARA It says lithium can control the condition. (nodding at the bottles) Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along. 
STEPHEN Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat. 
SARA I think it's time I moved in with Irene. 
INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT 
A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor. And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca. Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE 
THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS 
IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? 
INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in. Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene. She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms. Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find Rebecca's in the mirror. 
IRENE I'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful. 
REBECCA SMILES 
REBECCA Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it? 
IRENE It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna party. Rebecca smiles. A beat. 
REBECCA Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips. 
REBECCA You're right... cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's. 
REBECCA Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate. 
IRENE As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and...no roommate. 
REBECCA What are we waiting for? 
INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm.. 
IRENE Shit. She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.

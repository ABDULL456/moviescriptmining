INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY 
The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House. 
PRESIDENT How soon will it strike the city? 
STAFFER Seventeen minutes, Sir. 
PRESIDENT This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen. As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES LOGO on the doors. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 
Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC. 
INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS. 
SHIPWRECK That cannon's going to kill us all. 
HEAVY DUTY My guy will take care of it, trust me. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - ENERGY SHAFT - DAY 
Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft into freezing waters. Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a gangway. They both leap up and begin to fight again. The Neo- Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly unfazed as he slowly freezes solid. 
All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit modules. This is where the energy is charged to operate the cannon. One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and burns him severely. Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY 
Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately weave and dodge. 
INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY 
.and the LASER NET fades. Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake- Eyes continue their desperate fight. Swords FLASH and CLANG, two masters at their best. AND WE FLASH CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight. Storm Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face. Again, Hard Master watches without expression. AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on. Storm Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake- Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that threatens to disintegrate his crotch. Storm Shadow sees this, grins to himself. 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY 
A staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President. 
STAFFER It seems somebody's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow. 
PRESIDENT Thank God... As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff. We see an INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo- Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo- Viper holds his pistol on the President as-- 
--A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock. 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY 
Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him. 
RIPCORD Second drone in my sights. 
INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room. 
BREAKER Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere. 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY 
Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile. 
RIPCORD Taine! But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.

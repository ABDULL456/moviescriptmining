NOTES) Uhuh... Now, I've been doing some research and I think you're probably quite a private man. Am I right? 
NATHAN LANE Well... 
SIDNEY Which is fine, but today, I think it would be great to get behind the mask. 
NATHAN LANE 
(BEAT) Uh, I don't think there really is a mask as such, and I don't wanna be a pain, but what I really wanna talk about is the new play, keep it about the work, you know? Is that okay? 
SIDNEY Absolutely. Of course. So, first question - are you Jewish? Nathan stares at Sidney. 
NATHAN LANE I don't see what the relevance of that is. 
SIDNEY Okay. Next question. The rat thing - that's gotta be Disney's first gay animal, right? So, I was wondering - are you a homosexual? Beat. Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney. 
62 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 62 
Clayton glares at Sidney from behind his desk. 
CLAYTON HARDING What did I say to you? 
SIDNEY What...? 
CLAYTON HARDING What did I say to you? 
SIDNEY I just... 
CLAYTON HARDING What did I say to you? 
SIDNEY Don't upset anyone. 
CLAYTON HARDING Don't upset anyone. 
SIDNEY I was just trying to...probe. 
CLAYTON HARDING You wanna probe become a proctologist, okay? You can't ask musical comedy stars whether they're Jewish or gay. From now on just assume they're all Jewish and all gay, okay? 
63 INT. I SPY AREA - DAY 63 
Sidney is on the phone. He has been idly applying magic tape to his face, contorting it into a grotesque grimace. The headline of a magazine open in front of him reads: "Everyone Loves A Lord: Why British Titles Drive New York Women Crazy." 
SIDNEY I'd like to apply for an American Express card please? (Beat) Hon. Sidney Young. (Beat) As in Honourable. H-O-N. (Beat)It's a British title. Across the desk Alison watches him with contempt. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen. Just fill in the form will you? Sidney suddenly notices Sophie Maes and Eleanor Johnson walking towards them. Sophie looks more STYLED than before. She is holding her Chihuahua, Cuba, which is dressed in a tiny coat. Sidney DISAPPEARS UNDER THE DESK. We hear a RIP as he yanks the tape off his face. 
SIDNEY (O.S.)(CONT'D) (in pain, under desk) Oh, fuck...! 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(WALKING OVER) Hey! Cuba! He pets the dog, who greets him enthusiastically. 
SOPHIE MAES 
(TO LAWRENCE) He likes you. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(SMILING SMOOTHLY) Well, I'm one of the Friends Of Cuba. 
He laughs, Sophie smiles, not getting it. Alison seems immersed in some paper-work. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) So how's it feel to be a star? 
SOPHIE No, don't! It's so embarrassing! That picture's everywhere now. And I had no idea the dress was so see-through! And people are talking like it was some kind of stunt. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(SMOOTHLY) Such a cynical age. Hello Sidney. Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk. 
SIDNEY Hello! Didn't, didn't know you were coming in...?

{"test1_input": "JACK (CONT'D) That Master Drone was hit right over mid-town. Same area as the one we lost last night. \nEXT. HILLSIDE -- LATER \nJACK'S BUBBLESHIP, locked and armed, sits atop a ridge, against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky. Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down semi-intact on its side. Nothing. He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath- taking. It's hovering over what is left of a subsided harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships. The water level has dropped by a kilometer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Gatherer is sucking up salt water, harvesting the elements essential to create DEUTERIUM, \"Heavy Hydrogen.\" At the top of the giant machine, Drones work tirelessly, ferrying containers of Deuterium energy up into the sky. Jack raises the Binocs, snaps a few photographs... \nVICTORIA There's no Drone signal there. \n(BEAT) What are you doing, Jack? \nJACK One day when we get to Mars, someone will want to know about this. From someone who was here. He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards. \nJACK (CONT'D) Do we have to take it all? \nVICTORIA It's not doing anyone any good here. JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows- like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) Jack, without a signal, you're looking for a needle in a haystack. I think we've had enough excitement for one day. JACK is at the back of the Bubbleship, throwing levers. \nJACK Actually I've got a bit of a problem with a gyro here, call you when I've fixed it. He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE. As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster- tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 2) JACK rides over what used to be the sea-bed, soaking up the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of black sand. Completely carefree, enjoying himself like a man who is utterly and completely alone. \nEXT. SINK HOLE - DAY \nSomething was here. A large metal beam has been propped onto rocks, stretching over... a COLLAPSED SECTION OF EARTH. This was the source of the light reflection. Jack stares down into the hole... black. He POPS a flare, drops it in. It comes to rest far below, next to the unmistakable form of a DRONE. \nJACK .There you are. An instant of BLACK... And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing. Something is watching him. \nINT. SINK HOLE - DAY \nInside the hole, looking up. A CLIMBING ROPE spills towards camera. We descend with Jack, all the way down into the hole, the light receding above. He touches his suit and a light array blazes on, illuminating the walls passing by. \nINT. LIBRARY -- DAY \nJack drops down through what used to be a roof... into the READING ROOM OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY. Vast, ruined, the far end totally collapsed, like a sky-scraper fell on it. He reaches the silty floor, the flare's burning light illuminating the room. He STARES at the expanse of SHELVES that line the walls, stripped and empty. Wonder... and disappointment. He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone. The thing's a wreck. A METAL SHAFT protrudes from a crease. Jack marvels at the accuracy of the shot... He carefully reaches out, slides the fuel cell door open. Again, the FUEL CELL is missing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACK Vika, you're not going to believe... WHITE NOISE on the comm. There's no signal down here. \nEXT. HILLSIDE -- CONTINUOUS \nThe static BUBBLESHIP sits inert. \nVICTORIA ON THE COMM Jack? Jack... ? \nINT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS \nVictoria, worried. Finally, she turns to the TET COMM. A station reserved for high-tech, long-range communication with the home base. A STATUS indicator, and a screen for text communication. \nTET COMM STATUS: \"COMMUNICATION ENABLED.\" \n", "test1_true": "INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nJACK looks up and sees how the Drone was brought down: above it is a twisted tangle of chain-mesh and cables strung between two structures, a DRONE TRAP. MOVEMENT FROM THE DARKNESS. Jack spins, his gun coming off his back in a fluid motion. Just the empty cavern, the wreckage at the end. Jack squints at... a wall of books on the shelves beyond the wreckage. \nJACK .Jackpot. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He steps forward... ALMOST FALLS INTO A GIANT HOLE! He raises the flare off the ground, illuminating a void where the entire floor has imploded down seven more stories. What's left is a PIT, with a building-sized ton of twisted metal hanging over it... A single bent GIRDER still spans the hole. Jack tracks the possibilities... steps out onto the girder. He reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance... IT SHIFTS! A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an inch above him. Best leave that alone... He balances, inching across this metal tightrope. Finally reaching the other side... \nAT THE FAR SHELVES Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them. He kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: \"THE \nEDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS.\" He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises from the debris, goes taught! JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness. INHUMAN SCREAMS. Half animal, half electronic. Something's in pain, but not retreating, CLOSING ON HIM. Jack SLICES DOWN, cutting loose the claw, and RUNS FOR IT back towards the HOLE as his girder is yanked away in front of him, pulled into the void below. Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge, LEAPS! A moment, Jack hanging in space, gravity clawing at him, falling... SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the far side. ALIEN FORMS emerge from recesses. We get glimpses of feathers, oily flesh, metal... They CLOSE as he reaches his line, clips in and RISES automatically, the suit riding the line up at neck-snapping speed... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 2) ABOVE. The line trembles under his weight and stress... A KNIFE, improvised from bone and sheet metal, enters the frame and CUTS THE LINE. Jack has a second to feel the slack hit. And then he's FALLING... IMPACTS the ground. Can't get his air. Staggering wildly to his feet, FORMS CLOSING... Suddenly a DRONE blasts down through the ceiling hole. Its lights turning night to day, its cannons FIRING. In the STROBING FLASH of canon fire, we see SCAVS INCINERATED. Metal and hair fry to ASH as the insect- like creatures SCREAM!! Other shots IMPACT WALLS. Fire and plaster dust fills the space. Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases firing, WHIRLS on Jack. The same awful moment as it SCANS him. Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived. And with its departure, the darkness comes again. Silence, whatever was here is now gone. Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash of an alien, burning paper twisting in the air. He looks up towards the light above. A long ways above. \nEXT. SINK HOLE - LATER \nJack appears, dirty-faced, filthy and frustrated, crawling, lugging his own weight up through the sink hole. Finally back to the surface. He shakes himself off... notices his bike has been taken. \nJACK \n(AD-LIBBING \nEXPLETIVES) That was my bike!! He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as he's reminded of his injured leg. He stares at the long walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him, soaking him. He starts walking. \nEXT. BUBBLESHIP - DUSK \nThe debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets. Jack's Bubbleship bursts from the low clouds, carrying Jack home after the long day. We see the \"PLANETARY RING\" formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon. \nINT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS \nJack marvels at the ring, thoughtful. But then checks his read-outs. Victoria knows what he's looking for. \nVICTORIA Check your seven. Jack touches his controls and the Bubbleship Canopy REVOLVES so Jack's facing away from the direction he's traveling in. Low on the HORIZON, the TET floats in the sky. It's setting, glows a dull orange, like a Harvest Moon. INTERCUT VICTORIA. She's leaning back in her command chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out at the Tet. Strangely quiet. In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and confusion... This small metal planet is his home. \nJACK Goodnight, folks... See you back here tomorrow. Same time, same channel... He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at... \nEXT. SKY TOWER, LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS \nThe GLASS walls of the SKY TOWER reflect the Bubbleship as it lands. HOOKS catch the landing rockers of the BUBBLESHIP and lock it down against the buffeting wind. \nINT. SHOWER - DUSK \nJack drops the last piece of his environment suit. He touches a button and warm water sprays down. Through the glass, he can see Victoria inside the Sky Tower. She nods at him, a tense welcome home. He nods back. There is no privacy in the Sky Tower. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: As the glass walls go opaque with steam, he closes his eyes, the water running over his face. POPS OF MEMORIES go through his imagination: SKY TOWER. Early in their tour, Victoria girlishly jumps on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, laughing. BEDROOM. Also early. Jack watches Victoria sleep, brushes hair from her face, affectionate... And the memory... SEEMS TO DISTORT. Suddenly becoming: THE NEW YORK SKYLINE, seen through a cheap telescope. Jack, pulling away from the telescope, happy, turning to... A BRUNETTE WOMAN, staring back at him. Jack STARTS, snapping out of the memory. \nINT. SKY TOWER, STORAGE AREA - DUSK \nRows and rows of shelves, mainly empty now. Jack and Victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed for a 5-year tour. Jack grabs a container of water. \nINT. SKY TOWER, READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \n", "test1_id": 2682, "test2_input": "The Bubbleship soars through the sky. There's something particularly calm, picturesque, exquisitely beautiful about the earth below. Jack pilots. In the seat next to him, Julia is pale, propped against the canopy, recovering. She watches him. He's aware of her gaze, but he doesn't look over. \nINT. CRATER LAKE, GROTTO - SUNSET \nJulia weakly stands amidst the tarped supplies, aware she's trespassing somewhere utterly private. Outside, the sound of Jack splitting wood. She takes in the books, the records, the mementos of the past. Sees the Jammer up and working... Jack comes in, gets to work piling wood in the fireplace. He won't meet her eyes. Scared of himself, ashamed in front of her... \nJACK I always thought that plateau up there could be for a house someday. I thought about remaining here, letting the rest of humanity run off to Mars. And we'd just stay here. Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said \"we.\" \nJULIA I'm sorry. Jack... \nJACK No. He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to crackle. He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake. She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake. WITH JACK. He stares out over the water. Letting the truth wash over him. And then MUSIC from the grotto... the opening bars to the Temptation's \"My Girl.\" \nINT. GROTTO, CRATER LAKE -- NIGHT \nJulia stands by the record player, watching the disc revolve. She looks up when Jack's form appears in the doorway. He's been out there too long, cold. \nJULIA He loved this song. Jack sits, shivering, looking out at the lake. She moves to him, wraps a blanket around him. \nJACK What was he like? \nJULIA He was arrogant, and annoying, and the best man I'd ever known. Some distant part of Jack smiles at that. \nJULIA (CONT'D) .And I loved him. \nJACK I'm not that man. \nJULIA Shhhhh. Yes you are. She rests her head against on his shoulder, holds him. Simple, caring. His eyes... close. \nINT. MISSION CONTROL, NASA - EVENING (FLASHBACK) \nA group of ASTRONAUTS and NASA CONTROLLERS are celebrating. A television screen reads: \"Odyssey Mission a GO!\" A YOUNGER JACK and JULIA are among the people celebrating. As an ASTRONAUT pops champagne, Jack and Julia find a private alcove, he lifts out the engagement ring that she wears on the necklace around her neck... \nYOUNGER JACK We should just tell everybody. \nYOUNGER JULIA No, when we come home... They KISS... \nTNT. A DARK ROOM - NIGHT Their bodies entwined. Kissing, touching. Clothing pulled away. Staring into each other's eyes. \nINT. NASA CREW APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN \nYounger Jack stares out the window at the Odyssey on its launchpad in the distance. Steam rolls off its engines. It's being readied to launch. \nYOUNGER JULIA Hey... He looks over, smiles. She's naked under the sheets, happy, smiling back at him. \nEXT. CRATER LAKE - MORNING (PRESENT) \nJack's eyes blink open. Julia is asleep near him, peaceful. He turns, stares into the lightening morning sky. The Tet rising with the sun. \nEXT. CRATER LAKE -- MORNING \nJack walks to the water's edge. He stares at the reflection of the Tet in the glassy surface of the lake. And under that, a fish, nibbling algae... He smiles at the fish. \nJULIA (O.S. ) Good morning. He turns. She's there, arms held around herself against the chill of morning. They look at each other, so much to be said. \nJACK We can't stay here. She smiles, nods. \nINT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY \nJack and Julia fly low over terrain. As the Bubbleship crests a rise and drops down into a steep canyon, she takes his hand. He glances at her, lets his hand stay in hers. The entrance to Raven Rock looms ahead... \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: His eyes narrow. There's SMOKE, drifting from inside Raven Rock. \nEXT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY \nAs the Bubbleship touches down, the carnage becomes clear. A few shattered DRONES lie here and there, but there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere. JACK grabs his carbine, heading inside. \nJACK Stay here... \nINT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY \nAs Jack moves into the darkness of the ruined Raven Rock, his suit's lights blaze on. He moves in, weapon ready. Bodies are everywhere, blasted to pieces. FIRES still burn here and there. Paint bubbles on burning canvas. Records melt and drip in the heat... Jack turns a corner, finds Sykes STARING AT HIM! But his eyes are dead. Sykes still holds a spear implanted in a Drone's wrecked body. A FLICKERING LIGHT draws Jack's attention. \nINT. RAVEN ROCK, CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nBEECH is slumped in a chair, blastburnt, clutching a charred black box in his arms. His eyes half-lidded, he \nSTARES AT: Newsreel footage, from when the Tet arrived. On the screen crowds stare, the UN meets, Cults form. THE MOON in the sky, its surface VIBRATES, then starts to come apart. People SCREAM... Cutting to War Footage. Alien Troop-ships touching down, their design distinctly Tet-like. They discharge waves of warriors... CLOSE ON: Hand held, war-journalism. We see the alien soldiers pushing back resistance. All of them are versions of Jack. One sights the cameraman, BLAM! Blows him away. Camera hits dirt.. SMASH! Jack is there next to Beech. He's just pushed the projector over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBEECH (not looking up) The first ones were soldiers, programmed only to kill. Beech slowly, painfully, looks at him. Little emotion in Beech, just resigned recognition. \nBEECH (CONT'D) Later, there were new versions. More... creative. The Tet needed something different. And finally there was... you. \nJACK I'm the weapon of this war. BEECH smiles sardonic, nods. \nBEECH The Tet. The clockmaker God. Such brilliant, complex machinery... For such a simple task. To steal our water, our life... all for fuel. \n(BEAT) It doesn't even care about us. It's just... effective. \nJACK Why didn't you tell me? \nBEECH Not the kind of news that. (coughing up blood) .motivates a man. Beat,then low, defeated. \nBEECH (CONT'D) We lost, Jack. It won. \nJACK The device...? \nBEECH (shaking his head) No Drone. It will go on, devouring world, after world... \n(BEAT) You like books, Jack. Beech closes his eyes, recalling from memory... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 2) \nBEECH (CONT'D) \"Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valient never taste of death but once.\" Beech's voice trails off... Jack kneels in front of Beech. The old man's eyes are open, fixed on the artwork, the remnants of humanity... But they don't blink any longer. Beech is dead. Jack reaches up, closes Beech's eyes. He removes the box from Beech's arms: The flight recorder from the odyssey. \nJULIA'S VOICE There is a way. Julia stands in the doorway to the library. \nJULIA It wants me. Bring me to it. (off his silence) I'm right. You know I am. It's the only way. \nINT. WORK HANGER, RAVEN ROCK - MOMENTS LATER \nThe room destroyed. The disassembled Drone a smoking hulk. Jack works in front of an open Delta Sleep Pod from the Odyssey. He HAULS the cylindrical BOMB to the Pod, slots it into the space for personal effects... \n", "test2_id": 2683, "test3_input": "JULIA Is it ready? Julia is standing at the entrance to the room. He nods and she approaches, STARES at what will be her coffin. \nJACK Julia... \nJULIA Let's just do it. She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him. It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed. Finally, it breaks. She backs away, into the Pod, next to the BOMB. Trembling as the door starts to CLOSE. Suddenly, she's very scared. Fighting back panic. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJULIA (CONT'D) Jack... Jack!! The door closes, SEALS. Jack stares down at her through the carapace. He puts a hand on the glass. She puts hers on the other side. \nJULIA (CONT'D) .I got this. He touches a button and a pale gas starts to fill the chamber. Julia realizes that this will be her last moment of consciousness. Trembling, crying, afraid... \nJULIA (CONT'D) Jack... And she falls asleep. Jack stares at her sleeping form. \nJACK Dream about us. \nEXT. RAVEN ROCK - LATER \nWind tearing at him, JACK loads the sleep pod onto the drone-carrier of the Bubbleship. \nTNT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP, OUTTER ATMOSPHERE - LATER \nThe Bubbleship hovers high above the clouds, the Delta Pod attached beneath it. Jack STARES down at the earth. He hits a control and the ship rotates, so it's facing upwards towards the Tet which fills the sky above. Jack touches the throttle and the Bubbleship begins to CLIMB. Jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to him. He touches a control and THE AUDIO fills the canopy. It's distant, fuzzy, recorded from deep space. Jack listens as the Tet grows in size in front of him. \nORIGINAL JACK'S VOICE Good morning folks, this is captain Jack Harper here in the cockpit. We're settling in at a cool one hundred and fifty clicks from the unidentified flying object... \nINT. SPACE SHUTTLE ODYSSEY - NO TIME ( FLASHBACK) \nThe ORIGINAL JACK in the Pilot's seat, ORIGINAL VICTORIA next to him, co-piloting. Jack GRINS as he peers out at the Tet, just a small geometry among the stars... \nORIGINAL JACK (to Mission Control) So far, from this distance, we're still reading zero heat signatures, no sign of organic life. Did I mention we're still really far away? \nORIGINAL VICTORIA Mission plan has us approaching to one hundred kilometers, doing our initial readouts... \nORIGINAL JACK Yes, because everyone knows, if you want to really know something, one hundred kilometers is the best \nDISTANCE -- \nORIGINAL VICTORIA Stop. We don't know what it is, if it has intentions. \nORIGINAL JACK (to Mission Control) I think she just made my point -- \nINT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - CONTINUOUS (PRESENT) \nJack touches a control, the sound from the recorder FAST FORWARDS. Hours and hours of time on the odyssey fly by. The Bubbleship has reached the stratosphere where the blue sky gives way to black space. We see the small ship detach from the blue curve of earth, the blackness of space in front of it. \nJACK Bob, let's prep for outer atmosphere. OUTSIDE, the Bubbleship starts to transform for outer space as it RISES higher and higher... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE TET (a metallic voice) Technician Harper. \nJACK Finally. There you are. \nTHE TET Your ship has converted to space mode. This is not authorized. \n", "test3_true": "JACK (CONT'D) We are... a more effective team. \nTHE TET .Proceed. Jack... exhales. The TINY BUBBLESHIP climbs towards the massive artificial moon as the audio from the flight recorder surrounds him again... \nORIGINAL JACK'S VOICE -- We don't know if we're dealing with E.T. or the Klingons here, and we're not going to from this distance. \nINT. SPACE SHUTTLE ODYSSEY NO TIME (FLASHBACK) \nThe ORIGINAL JACK and ORIGINAL VICTORIA, in a friendly argument. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA It could be inert. Anything on it could be long gone by now. \nORIGINAL JACK Which is why we need to make contact, before it just blows on by like some... \nORIGINAL VICTORIA Which is why we need to make contact. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He double-takes, relieved that she finally agrees with him, smiles. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA (CONT'D) (to Mission Control) I agree with Commander Harper. It crossed whatever light years of space and time to come this close to us. We're not going to really know anything about it from this far away. \nINT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - CONTINUOUS PRESENT \nJack sits in the Bubbleship, the Tet looming above, the voices surrounding him.., remembering. \nINT. ODYSSEY SPACE SHUTTLE - NO TIME (FLASHBACK) \nThey must have been given clearance to approach, because the Tet now FILLS the view in front of them. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA Mission control says maintain one thousand meters. Original Jack touches a control. The Shuttle pushes forward, a little. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nORIGINAL JACK This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA We have our orders, Jack. We're to let it proceed without -- \nORIGINAL JACK We are. We're going to let it proceed whereever it's going... He lifts out of his seat, floats back towards the mid- section of the Shuttle. \nORIGINAL VICTORIA Jack... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He's already pulling on a spacesuit. Near him is the row of Delta Sleep Pods. In the nearest one, he can see Julia, asleep. He puts his hand on the glass... \nORIGINAL JACK I'll be right back... \nORIGINAL, VICTORIA Are we really going to do this? He looks over. original Victoria is already pulling on her spacesuit... A last glance back at Julia, then he turns away. He smiles at Victoria, drifts next to her, pulling out a small camera and pointing it back at the two of them... \nJACK Let's make history. FLASH. The birth of the picture of the two of them, eyes filled with anticipation. The photo in Jack's locker. \nEXT. THE ODYSSEY IN SPACE - NO TIME \nThe shuttle airlock cracks. Two figures in Space Suits emerge. Small puffs of gas, they head towards... REVERSE ANGLE. The Tet MASSIVE in front of them. Their small forms shrinking at they approach it. CLOSE ON JACK. His face seen through his visor as they approach. Filled with wonder. The dark shadow of the Tet crossing over him, blacking out everything. \nINT.

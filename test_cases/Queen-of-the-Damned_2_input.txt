TALBOT My pleasure. When I took you on as an apprentice, I knew it was the smartest thing I'd ever done. Now you and I'll meet when you're done... This will be our project... 
As Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles after her. 
But after the door closes, his gaze turns again to concern. He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into Marius's eyes. Then Talbot covers each with the black velvet. 
CUT TO: 
49   INT. JESSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  49 
Jesse sits on the floor, curtains drawn, the room lit with candles. A LESTAT SONG plays in the b.g. She opens the journal. 
JESSE Je suis le vampire Lestat... (a beat) I am the vampire Lestat. 
50   FLASHBACK - EXT. MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND - FULL SHOT               50 
A solitary paradise in a rough, nighttime sea.

LESTAT (V.O.) It was the winter of 1788 and I was brought to a Mediterranean Island by the man who made me... 
A lightning flash illuminates a sprawling 18th-Century sea-front villa. 
LESTAT (V.O.) ... if a man is what you'd call him. 
51   INT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     51 
A great round room encircled with candles, their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside STORM. A huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees... 
An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when... 
Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly... 
The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck. Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally... 
The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth -- 
MARIUS Lestat.    Welcome. 
Weakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror. 
(CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED:                                                   51 
LESTAT Who are you? Do I know you? 
MARIUS I'm unknowable by nature. 
Marius advances again on the young man... 
MARIUS But you may call me Marius. 
As Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away. 
LESTAT I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me. 
MARIUS I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home... 
His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor. 
MARIUS You're weak... near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat. 
LESTAT I'll kill you! 
Marius smiles, impressed. 
MARIUS You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible... 
Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide. 
LESTAT Chose me? For what? 
MARIUS My companion. Someone to share my burden. 
Bending down, he gazes at Lestat. 
MARIUS You've lost a great deal of blood. 
(CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              51 
LESTAT (near tears) I'm dying. 
Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt. With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his attacker's wrist. 
MARIUS Then drink.

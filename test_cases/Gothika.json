{"train": "(nods at nurse) Fifty milligrams. \nMIRANDA \nJesus Christ, you're gonna knock me out? Ten milligrams. \nPETE \n(final offer) Twenty. The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective. \nMIRANDA \nHow would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this? \nPETE \nWe can discuss it at length after you take your meds. Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant. Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nOkay.    This better be good. Pete motions for the others to leave them alone.         One by one they file out and lock the door behind them. \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER \nMiranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset. \nPETE \nMiranda, this is very awkward. Technically I shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. So whatever is said here won't leave this room. I won't tell Parsons, I won't tell anyone. \nMIRANDA \nI want to talk to my husband. \nPETE \nYou can't to that. Sit down, please. Try to relax. \nMIRANDA \nWhy would I pretend to be in any way relaxed? \nPETE \nI understand you're upset. But we need to put some things in order. \nMIRANDA \nTwo massive understatements. He hesitates, unsure where to begin. \nPETE \nHow long have you been here? \nMIRANDA \n(laughs) What is this? Why are you doing this to me? \nPETE \nJust answer the question.    Humor me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nHi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a psychiatrist. I transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a little over a year ago. My job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife -- \nPETE \nI don't mean how long you've worked here, I mean how long you've been staying here. This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer. \nMIRANDA \nI'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical school just an elaborate dream? \nPETE \nOf course you're a doctor. A great doctor in fact. The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her. \nMIRANDA \nPete, how long have I been here? \nPETE \nFive days. \nMIRANDA \n(barely audible) What? \nPETE \nYou were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently. That lasted three days. Scans revealed left-sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits. Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we -- \nFLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT \nFLASH CUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - MIRANDA'S EYE \nJittery, alert. We scour her every blood vessel, iris, pupil. FILLING the SCREEN and now we distinctly make out an eerie shape reflected inside of it. But just for a sec -- The teenage girl. \nPETE (V.O.) \nWhat about your husband, what can you tell me about him? \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) \nMiranda shakes the puzzling images out of her head: \nMIRANDA \nExcuse me? \nPETE \nWhat's the last memory you have of him that night? \nMIRANDA \nMy last -- ? (frowns) Tell me nothing happened to Doug. \nPETE \nLet's backtrack a second. You left your office, you were driving home, you got detoured by the police -- Did you call someone on the phone that night? \nMIRANDA \nI don't know.    I might have. \nPETE \nWho would you call? \nMIRANDA \nI might have called Doug to tell him something. Or checked my answering service. \nPETE \nWere you seeing someone else that night? \nMIRANDA \nI beg your pardon? \nPETE \nThere was some trouble in your marriage, wasn't there? \nMIRANDA \nOf course not. She shakes her head emphatically as we: \nFLASH CUT TO: \nFLASHBACK - INT. LOFT - NIGHT \nCAMERA PANS ACROSS the large space to find Miranda and a MAN (whose face we don't see) kissing heatedly. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE (V.O.) \nWasn't there? \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) \nMiranda chases the disconcerting image out of her head. \nMIRANDA \nNo. There was no trouble in my marriage, I don't know what -- (stops herself) There is no trouble in my marriage. You just used the past tense; why? His face says he doesn't know how to tell her. \nMIRANDA \nDid something happen to Doug? \nPETE \nYou don't remember anything else. Anything at all? Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to dial: \nMIRANDA \nThis is preposterous.    What's wrong with Doug? \nPETE \nHe's dead. This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he will contradict his statement. \nMIRANDA \nNo, he's not. Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that. (sickened) Are you -- sure? \nPETE \nI'm positive. (painful beat) You killed him. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE \nAnother near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains. \nEXT. CHAPEL - DAY \nMiranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a handkerchief. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand, noticing the blood -- and now we are back in -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT) \nMiranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched. We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and bangs on the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nCan I get some assistance here? Hello?! \nShe waits.     Bangs on the door again. \nMIRANDA \nIrene?!   Anybody!? A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. A light is switched on down the corridor. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER... Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES it. Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens. Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and peeks -- The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda jumps back, screams. And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat. Rational thought kicking in -- \nMIRANDA \n(to self) Wake up, wake up... (beat) You're dreaming. It's not real. An anxiety dream, that's all. That's all. This is dream logic. If it was real, they would have heard you scream. There are twenty employees on the night shift. Fact. At least twenty. She props herself with her back against the wall. With a view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the door. \nMIRANDA \nI'm just dreaming. And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like before. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nI'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. \nLike her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter -- \nMIRANDA \n(voice rising) I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming -- And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light. EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS -- \nIRENE (O.S.) \nRise and shine, ladies! \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY \nIrene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse stand by. \nIRENE \n(shaking her) That means you, honey.   Up -- ! No reaction. \nIRENE \nRise and shine now.    Wake up. She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl did. \nIRENE \nEasy now, it's okay. Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak but has no voice. Clears her throat -- \nMIRANDA \nI need to see Peter Graham. \nIRENE \nAnd you have a session scheduled this afternoon -- \nMIRANDA \nRight now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIRENE \nHe's not even in yet, now let go my arm, honey. \nMIRANDA \nDoctor Grey, if you don't mind. \nIRENE \nActually I do mind. I start calling you 'doctor' and everybody else wants to be called 'doctor' -- \nMIRANDA \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELLEY \nSay no more. (sotto) I understand perfectly. \nShe hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers: \nSHELLEY \nDrawing is a great cover.   Good luck to you. With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about, arguing -- Life among the insane. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY \nPatients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by Irene. \nMIRANDA \nI don't -- I think I'm alright. \nIRENE \nYou go in last because you're special. (off Miranda's look) It's not a Mexican prison, toots. Everybody here minds their own business. \nMIRANDA \nIf it's all the same, I'd rather -- \nIRENE \nState law says we keep you ladies clean. And I'm a stickler for the law. (beat) Now come on. If you go downtown, you gotta dance. Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like about institutional bathing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the Stones' \"START ME UP.\" \nIRENE \n(checking watch) That's five minutes, group one. (to Chloe's group) Alright, ladies, nice and easy. The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls: names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars, cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda, slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in the corner. A moment later Irene nods for her to go in. \nINT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER \nMiranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her at the tile wall. More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \n(to self) It isn't real. It isn't real. \nOpens her eyes. Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L. Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the drain, too scared to look back up. \nMIRANDA \n(to self) It isn't real. You're hallucinating. Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP, DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her. Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers -- \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA \nMiranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering. \nMIRANDA \nShelley? \nSHELLEY \nAnd pick up those damn cigarette butts. Jesus, TV is dumb -- \nMIRANDA \nShelley, can you do me a favor?? Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look. \nSHELLEY \nThe housewives will find something better to do. \nMIRANDA \nCan you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall? Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her shoulder makes her jump -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIRENE \nEnough privacy for you? \nMIRANDA \nYes.   Thank you, Irene. But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the towel. \nIRENE \nWhat did you do? \nMIRANDA \nIt means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought I had any kind of involvement in what happened. \nMIRANDA \nAnd did you? \nPETE \nDid I what? \nMIRANDA \nDid I make it to your place?   Did I see you that night? \nPETE \nNo. We got disconnected and I couldn't get through to you. I sat there waiting all night. Figured you'd changed your mind. \nMIRANDA \nWhy didn't you tell me this before? \nPETE \nBecause the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. My job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe stares at him.     Queasy. \nMIRANDA \nYou're changing the subject. \nPETE \nThe subject is you don't trust me. \nMIRANDA \nRight now I don't trust anyone. She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged arm. \nPETE \nYou want to talk about today? She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head. Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare: \nMIRANDA \nI want to talk to my lawyer. \nPETE \nI think that's premature. \nMIRANDA \nI can't help what you think. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY \nSPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered to her: \nJENNA \nYou a Marlboro girl? Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun. \nMIRANDA \nI don't smoke, thanks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJENNA \nAll we have is our health, cupcake. (sits beside her) What I do is quit constantly, start again. Drives them all crazy. One day I quit three times. \nMIRANDA \nHuh. Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly. Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna rambles on. \nJENNA \nThey allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching. Check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock. Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being closely watched by two orderlies. \nMIRANDA \nWhat did you set on fire to wind up here? \nJENNA \nVery perceptive, Doc. I burnt down the building where I worked. I found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops -- of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. It's beside the point, really. Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She rises -- \nMIRANDA \nPhil. He keeps walking.     Headed to the parking lot beyond. \nYou wanna help me? You pity me? (grabbing her crotch) Suck me. The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd. Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties. Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they were doing. Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY TO NIGHT (TIME LAPSE \nPHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS) \nA sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH -- \nINT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR \nSLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors.      The air thick with dread -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT \nMiranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAs before, somebody seems to be watching her. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY \nIrene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden follows. \nIRENE \nHow are we feeling today? \nMIRANDA \n'We'? \nIRENE \nSorry I asked. \nMIRANDA \nDoesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics. \nIRENE \nFitting right in, aren't you? The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for the LIBRARIAN and the    odd janitor tidying up. An efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in place, glass of water    -- this is attorney THEODORE \n\"TEDDY\" HOWARD. \nTEDDY HOWARD \nMiranda. \nMIRANDA \nHi. Irene checks her watch.       The warden hangs back, keeping watch. \nIRENE \nShe's due back in the rec room in twenty, Counselor. \nTEDDY HOWARD \nThank you kindly. Miranda sits.      Waits until Irene is out of hearing range. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nTeddy, I know you knew Doug well and this is an extremely -- \nTEDDY HOWARD \nI'm here as your lawyer. So whatever my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence. First things first, how are they treating you? \nMIRANDA \nLike I'm crazy. \nTEDDY HOWARD \nYou know this place better than anyone. Anything out of the ordinary? \nMIRANDA \nOther than me being crazy?   No. \nTEDDY HOWARD \nThe DA is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week. They're eager to resolve this situation because -- well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here. Doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model. Our best shot -- scratch that, our only shot -- is to claim temporary insanity. As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage. \nMIRANDA \nWait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you know me. I wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. Not even in self-defense. Isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked Doug and I went into shock? Teddy shakes his head. \nMIRANDA \nYou're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind? \nPETE \nIs this a hallucination? \nMIRANDA \nYou tell me. But I do know what I sound like. Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right? \nPETE \nWhich is why I suggest we simply increase your dose until -- \nMIRANDA \n(venom) No!   Goddamnit! No! He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down. \nMIRANDA \nI'm sorry. Is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen? \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA (CONT'D) \n(beat; struggling) I want to believe you. I do. So I'll take your word for it -- you're not involved in this -- but you take mine: I didn't write this and I didn't kill my husband. He studies her.     Finally nods.   New tactic: \nPETE \nAlright. Let's say you didn't write this -- \nMIRANDA \nNumber one: I'm right-handed. Number two: I would have had to bring an X-Acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't I? Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope. \nPETE \nI think it's time you look at these. Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid. Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe. And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says: \n\"NOT ALONE.\" \nMiranda immediately tosses it away from her.      Repulsed -- \nFLASH CUT TO: \nFLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMiranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it. \nINT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) \nPETE \nYou wrote that. Any idea why? \nMIRANDA \n(panic rising) No, I didn't. No, I didn't! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it up for her to study again. \nPETE \nYou're the only person who can figure out what this means. Try to remember. Stop holding back. She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to shake as all of it finally comes flooding in -- \nFLASH CUT TO: \nFLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles. Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands. Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA. Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares -- WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there, beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up at: \nTHE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA \nshows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.) Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment -- When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it. \nINT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER \nMiranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at the marks on the door handle, towels and wall. \nGasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming back to her body and realizing what she's done, she slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as she can to make it all go away, and we -- \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBLACKNESS \nSilence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES. \nFADE IN: \nINT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY \nMiranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know. But at some point she must have turned off the water. She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked with blood. The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul, the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of blood, mortified at what she will find. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSoon enough the press will make the Manson Family reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air. Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front door. She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete Graham behind them. \nTeddy Howard is top notch. He's going to do everything in his power -- and he's quite resourceful -- to prove you're not fit to stand trial. Miranda, I know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying -- \nMIRANDA \nWho is that? Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete. \nPARSONS \nExcuse me? \nMIRANDA \nThe girl in the picture. WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl. \nPARSONS \nMy daughter. Miranda looks up at this, perplexed. \nMIRANDA \nShe's the girl I saw. \nPARSONS \nYou're obviously mistaken. \nMIRANDA \nI'm positive. She was hurt, bleeding. Is she all right? Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks. \nPETE \nMiranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office. You're just confused -- \nMIRANDA \nNot about this. Is she all right? \nPARSONS \nNo, she's not... all right. (beat) Rachel committed suicide six years ago. This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning. \nMIRANDA \nHow? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE \nMiranda, that's none of your -- \nPARSONS \nThat's okay. (to Miranda) Rachel was a very troubled girl. Handicapped since birth. She was born mute. My wife and I tried everything to help her fit in but... but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life. (beat) And she finally succeeded. Jumped off Ashley Bridge. She was only seventeen years old. Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here. She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like. \nMIRANDA \nI'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil. Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore.    Rises. \nPARSONS \nPeter, can I speak to you? The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her paranoia -- \nPETE (O.S.) \n... Textbook psychotic pattern... manifestation of guilt... \nPARSONS (O.S.) \n... much she knows about Rachel? \nPETE (O.S.) \nI'm telling you she doesn't... Concocted alternate reality... \nPARSONS (O.S.) \nI'm trusting you... crawling with cops. A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT \nMiranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes, looks this way and that, then closes them again. She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall. Squinting to cover every inch of the room. And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner. Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined. She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it. She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING LOUDER as she reaches the shadow -- She stretches out her hand and finally touches... NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling stupid. \nMIRANDA \nThis is not going to work. I'm sick of being watched, and I know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad. She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head. \nMIRANDA \nI'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm alive -- this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways. So whatever you are, whatever it is I'm making up here -- I'm letting you go, I'm setting you free. I'm the wrong person. And I need to sleep. I'm not afraid and I don't believe and I'm fully aware that this is all in my mind -- fiction -- a concocted alternate reality -- and I acknowledge it. And now I'm done with it. I'm going to sleep now. The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And now she climbs back in bed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR \nMiranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency exit door all the way at the end. TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase, shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their cells, awakened by the COMMOTION. Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty feet, fifteen, ten -- When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and pins her down. The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down -- \nMIRANDA \nIt's him! It's him! Jesus Christ, it's him! The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and we -- \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others. \nPARSONS \nWe've transferred her to a higher security room on the fifth floor. That's my final concession to any type of special treatment. \nPETE \nAnd the night staff? \nIRENE \nThey insist her room was properly locked, what else could they say? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE \nCould there be any truth to her claim? \nPARSONS \nPeter, we have one hundred and forty employees. Thirty-five work maintenance. They all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform. I'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure -- but I don't want a news van parked outside day and night. It makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it? Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way. \nPETE \nI perused Miranda's files on Chloe McGrath -- they're damn comprehensive. Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her. Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up: \nPARSONS \nThe scariest gift God gave us is our minds. And a bright person like Miranda -- she's grasping at straws here -- who knows what her brain is telling her, now that it's snapped. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY \nA better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is seated, observing her deteriorating state. \nMIRANDA \nDid you live here when Rachel killed herself? \nPETE \nYes. As a matter of fact, I was part of the search party that found the body. \nMIRANDA \nPhil must have been a wreck. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE \nYou can imagine. Actually, Phil was in Houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened. \nWhat was that?     Miranda reacts to this. \nMIRANDA \nAnd this is confirmed. There are hospital records and so forth? \nPETE \nI'm sure there are.   Can we get back on track now? Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket. \nMIRANDA \nWhat about these other dates, was Phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead? A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon. \nPETE \nWhere are you going with this? First I'm a suspect in Doug's death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own daughter? \nMIRANDA \nRachel Parsons disappeared six years ago. A week later she's a suicide. Andrew White, four years ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon, two years ago. Don't you find that unusual? He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article: \nPETE \nWhat same M.O.? One jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car. Who gave you this? \nMIRANDA \nNot one left a suicide note. In fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides? \n(CONTINUED) \nHold it, Simon! He hides the loot behind his back, busted.       She holds the door open and tosses him his yellow shirt. \nCLAIRE \nWhat do you think I am, laundry service? \nSIMON \n(relieved) Won't happen again, ma'am. She turns and exits.     The doors slide shut.   Meet our rapist. \nINT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY \nBustling with activity. The room is divided into two:          a large main area where the patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff. BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table. Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch nearby. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHELLEY \n... She'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras. Is that the strangest shit you've heard? \nJENNA \nHeard stranger. But she's a case. \nSHELLEY \nAnd she always put on a happy face. Man, what an optometrist. Optometrist?     Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it go. \nJENNA \nYou narced her out, didn't you? Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little buzzed yourself. Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck. Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna -- \nSHELLEY \nAll work, that woman.   Work, work, work. \nJENNA \nWhat are you talking about? \nSHELLEY \nShe's like an alcoholic.   But with work. \nJENNA \nWhat work? \nSHELLEY \nNot safe to tell you.   Wish I could. Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food. \nUPSTAIRS \nParsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area. \nBACK TO MIRANDA \nTrying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares at her untouched food, glassy-eyed. \nMIRANDA \nI saw what happened. I'm sorry. No reaction. \nMIRANDA \nHave you told anyone?   Chloe? Nothing. \nMIRANDA \nLook, Chloe -- the person who did this to you is not the devil. And if you can identify him, I'll make sure the motherfucker is arrested. Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers. \nCHLOE \nDoctor, did you just say 'motherfucker'? \nMIRANDA \nDo you know his name? Maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform? Think. Chloe simply stares.    Finally shakes her head. \nCHLOE \nMan, you must really hate me. \nMIRANDA \nWhat?   I don't hate you. \nCHLOE \nYou hate me because now you're just the same as me. You must feel so embarrassed. \nMIRANDA \nI don't hate you. And I don't feel embarrassed. \nCHLOE \nThat's just a pat answer you have because you're new at this. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house. Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around back. She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back door. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE \nPOLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room, avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether. Eerie as hell -- \nINT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS \nMiranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport, digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast -- \nINT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nMiranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips the RADIO dial with shaky hands. \nRADIO DJ (V.O.) \n... Weather forecasters predict heavy winds tonight as a major thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow. You're listening to KLPG, 101.4 on your dial. This next honky-tonk heartbreak classic is... She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes. Rachel's.     Inside the car. Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom. Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180 and slides to a halt in the middle of the street -- Facing the direction of her house again. \nEXT. STREET \nMiranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath, making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a U-turn. \nINT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMiranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked. She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES -- \nMIRANDA \nNo. The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone. \nMIRANDA \nWhy are you doing this to me? A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMiranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys. We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes. She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now. BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS fastened around the insulators of a thick power line. From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys. And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some invisible force -- Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed Miranda -- She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like lightning. A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets. \nMIRANDA \n(fighting tears) What do you want from me? No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented: \nMIRANDA \nWhat is it you want me to do?!! A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound. It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nClearly Rachel wants her back in the house. \nMIRANDA \nI can't. (softly) Please, please don't make me go back in there. But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car. \nINT. SIMON'S CAR \nMiranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here. She's never asked a ghost for permission before: \nMIRANDA \nBear with me, I'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay. She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE \nMiranda stands in her living room, staring at her handiwork. Frozen with dread. The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains. The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc. The faded writing on the wall:       \"NOT ALONE.\" Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's supposed to be looking for. \nMIRANDA \n(piecing it together) Not alone. What happened to you happened to other girls. (beat) I understand. And I'm sorry. But there is nothing I can do about it now. It has nothing to do with me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNot knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump. The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL \nBLAST. \nShe stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and immediately doubles over in pain -- \nMIRANDA \nShit. She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin. Blood already seeping from the nasty cut -- \nINT. BATHROOM \nMiranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut. And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel. Inside the room with her -- Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have STOPPED. A silent beat. She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful. And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola. She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING \nLOUDER. \nMIRANDA \nNo.   No.   No... Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMiranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt. The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again -- the image is gone. \nIt is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far corner of the room. She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank- repossessed property. The address is in Willows Creek. Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel wanted her to see. She stares at it. PUSH IN ON the picture as we -- \nEXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY \nA car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and Pete step out, rush inside. \nINT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nSheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his case -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nMr. Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution -- \nTEDDY HOWARD \nHold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nMr. Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of -- \nTEDDY HOWARD \n(handing him a paper towel) You had no right to question my client without my presence -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nMr. Howard, this is not a courtroom. Your client was read her rights and she still insisted -- \nTEDDY HOWARD \n-- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client -- Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room, Teddy following closely -- \nINT. ER WAITING ROOM \nParamedics and nurses doing their thing. The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of coffee. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nI'm not a drug expert. I'm simply stating the frigging facts. Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nPhil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts! \nPARSONS \nWhat happened? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHERIFF RYAN \nAn 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word. \nPETE \nWho's the girl? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nA runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update. (to Teddy) Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer. Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to Turlington. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nChrist, the woman's got the entire hospital busy -- Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nWhy are you harassing my deputies? \nTEDDY HOWARD \nI'm only asking him where he got the coffee -- ? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nHe's not at liberty to answer that. You've had enough goddamn coffee already. The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately. \nPETE \nWe need to get Miranda back to the institute. She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nParsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nPhil, how well does your wife know the suspect? \nPARSONS \nWhy do you ask? \nYes, I -- you could say that. Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, \"reading\" her. \nCONSUELO \nShe's very, very angry. And she's not finished with you yet. \nMIRANDA \nI'm sure that's meant to sound comforting but -- \nCONSUELO \nShe wants to show you something. \nMIRANDA \nThat may be so, but I want her to go away. \nCONSUELO \nThen you need to protect yourself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nAnd how exactly would I do that? \nCONSUELO \nMira, first I'm gonna bring you some cascarilla, it's a powder, you get it anyplace, it comes from eggs -- you pour it all over you -- (indicates) Like this -- \nMIRANDA \nLook -- (reading nametag) Consuelo, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I honestly don't think this ghost will go away if I pour some egg powder on myself -- Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda.      She's receiving something here. Shudders. \nCONSUELO \nShe made you do things.   Bad things, didn't she? \nMIRANDA \nYes. \nCONSUELO \nAnd you carried this out for her. She used you as a vessel... Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we -- \nFLASH CUT TO: \nFLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT \nWe're back at the bridge.     Rachel pries open Miranda's mouth. Miranda panics: \nMIRANDA \nWhat are you doing? I'm trying to help you -- ?! Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds. And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) \nConsuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth: \nCONSUELO \nYou were possessed by her. \nMIRANDA \nYes. \nCONSUELO \nAy, probrecita. You're both in terrible danger. She's scared too but she can't step back into the light until she finishes what she started here. And now you're the only person who can help her find the way back. \nMIRANDA \nI don't know how to do that -- I'm not qualified for it. You do it. Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda. \nCONSUELO \nDespair is the only unforgivable sin. You'll be in my prayers, Miranda. Prayers?   What good is that going to do?   Consuelo exits. \nEXT. PARSONS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nTwo POLICE CRUISERS parked outside. \nINT. PARSONS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch, devastated. The SHOT is FRAMED so that we see the bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily tranquilized. Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs. \nON THE LURID POLAROIDS \nPostcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon, Tracy Seaver... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAnd young Rachel Parsons. \nPARSONS \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME \nThe two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME \nMiranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough, somebody else is in the room. She looks around. \nMIRANDA \nNo.   No.   What do you want -- ? And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards her. \nMIRANDA \nI've done everything you've asked me to. My life is ruined. I can't take this anymore. I can't... (faintly) You have to step into the light, Rachel. You don't belong here -- you don't belong... But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her. Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting tears -- \nMIRANDA \nInto the light -- (loudly) Can somebody come in here?       I need help. Somebody, please! \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS - \nSAME TIME \nThe cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights down the corridor. They walk towards them. \nIRENE \nAnd who are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nOfficer Turlington, ma'am. We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night. \nIRENE \nKnock yourself out. Next floor up. (loudly) It's only a power outage, ladies -- let's call it an early night. The cops head down the corridor. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME \nRachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face -- \nMIRANDA \nPlease don't. Why are you doing this? It's over. Over and done! Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on Miranda's eyes and shuts them -- \nFLASH CUT TO: \nMIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE \nin her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her half-naked, bruised. Dead. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nJENNY DIXON \nstaring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also bathed in the strange red and blue light -- \nEND OF MIRANDA'S VISION. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMiranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady. \nMIRANDA \nStop it! I don't want to see this! I can't help you anymore! Stop it! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNow a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half- pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the other side. \nMIRANDA \nLet me out of here! Let me out! There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing at once and Miranda covers her ears -- Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS -- \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR \nThe cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to escape. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT \nFIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush after her. \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE \nSheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nChrist Almighty. Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs. \nINT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR \nOfficer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching frantically with his flashlight -- \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT \nDo it quick.   I won't make fun of you. The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover. \nCHLOE \nNobody better fucking move up there or I'll blow this piggy's head off! Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table. \nCHLOE \nThat means you, fucko. Up on your feet or I'll start by shooting his ear off. A beat.   Officer Turlington rises.      Slow and deliberate. \nCHLOE \n(to Sheriff, sotto) Tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here. Do it. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nTurlington, it's alright. I can -- I'm just going to -- \nCHLOE \nThe grownups are talking.   Don't paraphrase me. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nThe grownups are -- are talking now. Just leave. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level. \nMIRANDA \nChloe?   Can I talk to you? \nChloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door. \nCHLOE \nDreadful timing, I'm real busy. \nMIRANDA \nYou have to let him go.   I'm sorry. Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style -- \nCHLOE \nLook -- let's not confuse things. I like you. But this is my only chance. (to Sheriff) Now take off that goddamn uniform before I get really pissed. The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods.       The Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt -- \nMIRANDA \nWhat are you going to do? Put on his uniform and walk out of here? Think about it, Chloe. They know you have him. The place is crawling with cops. \nCHLOE \nWhat are my options? To grow old in this place? It's clear they will never let me go. Never. Ever. \nMIRANDA \nThat's not true. You have less than a year left here. \nCHLOE \nThat's a lie! I'll never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. No wonder you doctors can't help anyone -- all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe starts sobbing.     Letting everything go -- \nMIRANDA \nYou're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. But I know you, Chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. And you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. It's up to you. This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun. \nMIRANDA \nNo more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness. You have no use for any of that anymore. Your life begins this very second. \nCHLOE \nI'm so tired.    So goddamn tired -- Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the gun. And that's when the power returns. Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO \nLIFE. \nMiranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea White and Jenny Dixon visions. Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the Sheriff, finally struck with the realization: \nMIRANDA \nIt was you, wasn't it? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nWhat are you talking about? She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup- style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED. Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of the slaughter. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \n'Not alone.' That's what Rachel has been trying to tell me all along. Doug was not alone. You were with him. This whole time it's been you. You covered up their deaths to look like suicides. The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking -- \nINT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER \nMiranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game: \nSHERIFF RYAN \nHow did you know? \nMIRANDA \nYou tell me. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nThis isn't one of your word association games, Doctor. Did Douglas tell you that night? \nMIRANDA \nWhy wait this long if he had? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nMaybe it's your amnesia. Maybe you blocked it out. \nMIRANDA \nMaybe. But it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure. He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nYou think me and Doug are monsters. That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. But it wasn't that at all. You do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. Life goes on. \nMIRANDA \nIf you're looking for forgiveness, you came to the wrong place. She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows it. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nOne thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nBe that as it may, you're afraid too -- because you know killing me won't solve your problems. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nMy only problem is you. \nMIRANDA \nWhat about Parsons? And Peter? They know. And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. You miscalculated, now you pay. Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nI hate a bad bluffer. She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung. \nMIRANDA \nI sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle. Can you? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nGo ahead, hit me back. It's what you want. \nMIRANDA \nNo, that's what you want me to do. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nBack to profiling, huh? Your thought process is completely transparent. And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing her opening scene with Chloe. \nMIRANDA \nSo we're even. You left that door open so I'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nI guess we'll find out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nAnd yet you have to make me look like a suicide. With what, your belt? (off his shrug) How would I get access to a belt? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nTrust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything. \nMIRANDA \nSHERIFF RYAN \nDoug settled down once you two got married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver -- He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nOr so he claimed. Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn't resist. I asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure. And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHERIFF RYAN \nYou can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life. \nThey're so close together their noses nearly touch. He gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nThe only soul you can ever count on is yourself -- BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him. Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nWhy, Doctor.   That was unexpected. He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nYou sure about this? He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed -- \nSHERIFF RYAN \nYou need me alive for your story to stick. Be logical now. You know you can't kill me. He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash. \nMIRANDA \nLogic is overrated. \nINT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold whisper, they stand up on their ends. \nPete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door. \nINT. RECOVERY ROOM #1 \nPete looks oddly around the room. \nPETE \nAnybody in here -- ? As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room. Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream. \nTRACY SEAVER \nHello -- ? \nEXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nTurlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues. \nINT. HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nTurlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nSheriff Ryan? No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTurlington peeks in.      checks the stalls. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nSheriff? Nobody. He notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it. \nINT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR \nThe FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete, Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area. \nFRONT DESK OFFICER \nI'm sorry, but nobody is allowed to visit at this hour -- \nPETE \nIs the Sheriff here or isn't he? \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \n(reaching the scene) Help you, gentlemen? \nPETE \nWe're here to see Miranda Grey. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \n", "test1_input": "Gothika by Sebastian Gutierrez \nREVISED SECOND DRAFT \nDecember 8, 2002 \nThe Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian. \nFADE IN: \nOPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS: \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nPUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows. \nINT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING \nMiranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel. \nINT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING \nMiranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nMiranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM. \nEXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING \nMiranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR \nMiranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n\"WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE\" \nThe gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we... \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING \nStark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session: \nMIRANDA \nThis is your stepfather who came to visit you? \nCHLOE \nMy stepfather?  No.   He's dead. (beat) I killed him. Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist. \nMIRANDA \nThat's the first time you admit it. \nCHLOE \nSo? There's a first time for everything. \nMIRANDA \n(jotting this down) It means you're finally past the denial stage. This is good, Chloe. \nCHLOE \nI never killed anyone who didn't deserve it. \nMIRANDA \nYou only killed your stepfather as far as I know. \nCHLOE \nI should've taken care of my mother. She knew all along.    You remind me of her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nI remind you of your mother? \nCHLOE \nAlways so put together. Like you iron your underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the -- \nMIRANDA \n(getting her back on track) Let's get back to your visitor last night. \nCHLOE \nThe Devil. \nMIRANDA \nAlright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain? \n", "test1_true": "He came to fuck an angel. (giggles at that) I'm his dirty angel. Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up. \nCHLOE \nHe grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him and usually I love that, I just do -- maybe you can tell me why I love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough -- As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock. \nMIRANDA \nThat's it until Monday. Try and get some sleep tonight, okay? \nCHLOE \nSure, Doctor. (leans in) Crazy people hear messages from God. Not the Devil. You know that, right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nI didn't say you were crazy. \nCHLOE \nYou don't have to say it. She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the asylum. \nINT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER \nMiranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches. \nPETE \nDr. Grey. \nMIRANDA \nDr. Graham. They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A lot. \nPETE \nPower went out again in our wing. \nMIRANDA \n(knows what's coming) Same here. \nPETE \nIt's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know? \nMIRANDA \nYou're not shrink appropriate and you're about to get promoted. Everybody's afraid of something. \nPETE \nWhat am I afraid of? \nMIRANDA \nYourself. At least you should be. What are you up to this weekend? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE \nWrite a little country music, decline invites to grand social events, drink myself to sleep -- the usual. You? \nMIRANDA \nDoug wants to look at some Real Estate up at Willow's Creek. \nPETE \nAgain? \nMIRANDA \nHe thinks it's fun. \nPETE \nSo is golfing, I'm told.   Who was your six o'clock? \nMIRANDA \nChloe McGrath -- talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup. She's a mess. \nPETE \nI hear Manhattan's full of them. \nMIRANDA \nDon't start with that. I already turned down the job. We're staying. \nPETE \nGood girl. They have reached an office marked \"DR. PHILLIP PARSONS DIRECTOR\" and peer in to see Parsons (50's, distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to exit when he covers the mouthpiece -- \n", "test1_id": 318, "test2_input": "PARSONS \nMiranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and Doug. Are you free tonight? \nMIRANDA \nHe's stuck at a school board meeting. Parsons looks through his appointment book. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPARSONS \nYou've been here a year already, Dorothy's starting to take this personal. How's next Wednesday? \nMIRANDA \nNext Wednesday it is, Phil. He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone call. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT \nMiranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind. A GUARD waves her off. \nEND OPENING CREDITS. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nMiranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road. EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her down. \nINT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nSHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over. \nMIRANDA \nAnybody hurt, Sheriff? \nSHERIFF RYAN \nNah, telephone post just decided to fall. It'll take us a while to clear this up so I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the long way home, Miranda. \nMIRANDA \nIf you say so. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nAnd tell your husband he owes me a phone call. \nMIRANDA \nWill do. Wouldn't want him in trouble with the authorities. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSHERIFF RYAN \nThat a girl. The law never sleeps and all that. You take care now. \nHe taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn. \nEXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nMiranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge. Something definitely creepy about this deserted place -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING \nMiranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the machine. \nMIRANDA \n(into phone) Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick up, pick up. I'm on my way but I just got detoured so I'm... A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up we see: \nPOV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nA TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked. About to get pummelled by us. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMiranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing. METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT -- She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out of it. \nMIRANDA \n(into phone) Stay on the line. Don't go anywhere. The weirdest thing just -- (the phone cuts out) Hello? Hello? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it. No go. \nMIRANDA \nWonderful. She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car. \nEXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT \nMiranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not moving. Just standing there. Her back to us. \nMIRANDA \n", "test2_true": "MIRANDA \nWere you in an accident? Were you attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor. (beat) My name is Miranda Grey... And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip, black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl -- \nMIRANDA \nYou're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural. I'm going to get you to the hospital. Okay? The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard. \nMIRANDA \nDon't be scared. It's going to be fine. Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down. \nMIRANDA \nHands off me, okay? Tell me your name, do you remember your name? The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell. And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nWhat are you doing? I'm trying to help you --?! \nThe girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body. \nSLAM CUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - DAWN \nMiranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A beat. FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP. Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there. She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom. She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door. A glass pane. She peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's inside a cell. She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic -- \nMIRANDA \nHello?   Somebody help me! \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nCAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard. Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens. The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab prison, with separate wings (male and female), research units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center. \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS \nA bored group of female patients listen to a social worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor. Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of orderlies. \nA doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing her tongue, prepare a syringe. Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart. Now we are MOVING up the main building's wall and THROUGH large windows into -- \nINT. FEMALE WING STAIRS \nPete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes -- \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL \nAn ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE. \nORDERLY #1 \nSleeping beauty is awake. Peter forces a smile, enters -- \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL \nMIRANDA \nPeter, what the hell is going on? Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here. \nPETE \nHow do you feel? \nMIRANDA \nHow do you think I feel?    Is this a joke? Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding ring is gone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nWhat are you doing? \nPETE \nGiving you something to calm down. \nMIRANDA \nI don't need to calm down.   What I need is an explanation Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle: \nPETE \nJust take this and we can sit down and chat. \nMIRANDA \nWhy here, why not in my office? She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy. Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving. \nMIRANDA \nI don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me Valium. \nPETE \n", "test2_id": 319, "test3_input": "PETE \nI know, I know. We'll see you then. \nSHERIFF RYAN \nAnd my offer still stands if you need added security. \nPETE \nThank you. She won't go anywhere. I guarantee it. The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive. \nMIRANDA \nThat's why Rachel picked me.    It was Doug. I'm so stupid. Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on about this time. Tries to remain professional. \nPETE \nInside, okay? \nINT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER \nLunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are, whispers something to them. They glance at the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort. Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door. An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear. \nMiranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies. And then, halfway across the room, one of the women stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together. Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them joining Chloe in clapping. \nPETE \nWhat is this? \nIRENE \nShe's a hero. Little Red Riding Hood put the big bad wolf in a coma. Pete nods.     Just what he needed.   The OFFICERS trade looks. \nOFFICER #1 \nThey're not gonna start something, are they? Irene shakes her head, amused. \nIRENE \nYou ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, Officer? The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her, mouths the words \"thank you.\" And Miranda is hauled out the side door. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL \nWhite. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse themselves. Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as well. \nORDERLY #1 \nWe'll be right outside, Doctor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOnce the doors are locked and they're alone, the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear: \nPETE \nI pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back. The best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here. Five. Under my -- \nMIRANDA \n(interrupting) Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts before this. And neither do you. Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on track: \nPETE \nBut you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. The simplest chemical deficiencies can -- \nMIRANDA \nChemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing! \nPETE \nI'm a very open-minded person, but as a doctor -- \nMIRANDA \nNo, you're not. You're a close- minded academic, just like me. You told me once that I was the most logical person you knew, remember? Well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. Rachel Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago -- tossed off the Ashley Bridge by my husband. My harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband -- that's how pathetically blind I've been. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA (CONT'D) \nAndrea White and Jenny Dixon were also abducted and murdered -- now this was before I met Doug but I bet you anything that they both went to his school. Then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions -- namely me -- delayed him from reverting to his sickness. That's why I didn't notice anything. I believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. Then along comes Tracy Seaver and he can't resist. Locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property -- She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing. \nMIRANDA \nHere's Doug's interest in real estate, Pete. Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek. \nMIRANDA \nRachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her -- she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention -- and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem. Made sure I killed Doug because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to her. And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way. Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded. \n", "test3_true": "Is that a threat? \nMIRANDA \nTo whom? \nPETE \nTo me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nTo you? I'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when I tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if I don't do what she wants -- she's going to kill me. Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak, but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A reminder of their very real connection. \nMIRANDA \nI need you to at least consider the possibility that I'm not insane. (beat; pleading) Not as a doctor. As the only person I trust in this world. \nEXT. NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY \nA tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car. \nDOROTHY \nI'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm doing this for Rachel. \nPARSONS \nYou're making a complete fool of yourself. Do you realize what you sound like? She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there. Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets him have it: \nDOROTHY \nWhat do I sound like, Phil? Like one of your patients? Well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me. And I've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed. BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOROTHY \nI'm losing my mind. Our daughter is gone and I miss her and I'm angry. \nShe turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car. \nINT. BANK VAULT - DAY \nA solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a moment. Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He opens it and spills the contents on the table. It is a stack of POLAROIDS. Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales, all blood draining from his face. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING \nThe sky darkens fast.     The storm moving in. \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES' STATION \nTHUNDER RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle. PAN UP to see Consuelo, the round black woman we might remember Chloe beating up earlier. She shakes her head. \nCONSUELO \nIt's gonna be an interesting night. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL \nMiranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and the handle unfastened. Through the door comes Consuelo, carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed. She is on her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCONSUELO \nHow are we doing today? That term again, \"we.\" Doctor-speak.         Miranda doesn't have the energy for it: \nMIRANDA \nJust fine, thank you. \nCONSUELO \nThe spirit is not fine.    She's very unhappy. What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman as if she were crazy, but things have changed. \nMIRANDA \nHow -- how do you know? \nCONSUELO \n(shuts her eyes) But she's only a girl. Do you know her name? \nMIRANDA \nYes.   Rachel. \nCONSUELO \nHave you talked to her? \nMIRANDA \n", "test3_id": 320}

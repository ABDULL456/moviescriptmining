Good luck to you. With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about, arguing -- Life among the insane. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY \nPatients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by Irene. \nMIRANDA \nI don't -- I think I'm alright. \nIRENE \nYou go in last because you're special. (off Miranda's look) It's not a Mexican prison, toots. Everybody here minds their own business. \nMIRANDA \nIf it's all the same, I'd rather -- \nIRENE \nState law says we keep you ladies clean. And I'm a stickler for the law. (beat) Now come on. If you go downtown, you gotta dance. Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like about institutional bathing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the Stones' \"START ME UP.\" \nIRENE \n(checking watch) That's five minutes, group one. (to Chloe's group) Alright, ladies, nice and easy. The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls: names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars, cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda, slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in the corner. A moment later Irene nods for her to go in. \nINT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER \nMiranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her at the tile wall. More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \n(to self) It isn't real. It isn't real. \nOpens her eyes. Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L. Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the drain, too scared to look back up. \nMIRANDA \n(to self) It isn't real. You're hallucinating. Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP, DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her. Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers -- \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA \nMiranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering. \nMIRANDA \nShelley? \nSHELLEY \nAnd pick up those damn cigarette butts. Jesus, TV is dumb -- \nMIRANDA \nShelley, can you do me a favor?? Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look. \nSHELLEY \nThe housewives will find something better to do. \nMIRANDA \nCan you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall? Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her shoulder makes her jump -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIRENE \nEnough privacy for you? \nMIRANDA \nYes.   Thank you, Irene. But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the towel. \nIRENE \nWhat did you do? \nMIRANDA \n", "test1_true": "IRENE \nWhat the hell did you do to yourself?! And now the other patients are curiously watching as orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away. \nINT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER \nTHROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room. \nIRENE \nI looked away for a second. It's unacceptable, won't happen again. \nPARSONS \nNot your fault. Patients always find a way to hurt themselves if that's what they want. \nIRENE \nI just didn't peg her for a cutter, that's all. Parsons watches Miranda through the glass.       She can't look him in the eye. \nINT. REC ROOM - LATER \nMiranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared. \nSHELLEY \nOh my God.   Oh my God. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nYou saw it? \nSHELLEY \nListen, Doctor. Some people, they have a gift. And in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that. It's like that Hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago? It's like that. Doesn't mean you're crazy. It only means your eyes open in a different way. Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but has a sinking feeling. \nMIRANDA \nWhat did it say? \nSHELLEY \nOn the telescope? \nMIRANDA \nDid you see anything, Shelley? Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear. \nSHELLEY \nThat's not tile that wall is made out of . It's a holographic screen. All part of your mission, isn't it? Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish.     Walks away. \nMIRANDA \nThanks anyway. \nSHELLEY \n(taps her forehead) This is all we have. The rest is dust. \nINT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY \nPete and Miranda stare at each other.     A tense beat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nIt was you I called that night. \nPETE \nYes. \nMIRANDA \nDid you mention that to the cops? \nPETE \nNo. \nMIRANDA \nWhy? \nPETE \nI didn't think it would help you. \nMIRANDA \nWhat does that mean? \nPETE \n", "test1_id": 318, "test2_input": "The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house. Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around back. She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back door. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE \nPOLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room, avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether. Eerie as hell -- \nINT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS \nMiranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport, digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast -- \nINT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nMiranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips the RADIO dial with shaky hands. \nRADIO DJ (V.O.) \n... Weather forecasters predict heavy winds tonight as a major thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow. You're listening to KLPG, 101.4 on your dial. This next honky-tonk heartbreak classic is... She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes. Rachel's.     Inside the car. Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom. Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180 and slides to a halt in the middle of the street -- Facing the direction of her house again. \nEXT. STREET \nMiranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath, making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a U-turn. \nINT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMiranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked. She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES -- \nMIRANDA \nNo. The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone. \nMIRANDA \nWhy are you doing this to me? A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMiranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys. We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes. She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now. BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS fastened around the insulators of a thick power line. From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys. And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some invisible force -- Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed Miranda -- She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like lightning. A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets. \nMIRANDA \n(fighting tears) What do you want from me? No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented: \nMIRANDA \nWhat is it you want me to do?!! A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound. It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nClearly Rachel wants her back in the house. \nMIRANDA \nI can't. (softly) Please, please don't make me go back in there. But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car. \nINT. SIMON'S CAR \nMiranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here. She's never asked a ghost for permission before: \nMIRANDA \nBear with me, I'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay. She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk. \nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE \nMiranda stands in her living room, staring at her handiwork. Frozen with dread. The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains. The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc. The faded writing on the wall:       \"NOT ALONE.\" Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's supposed to be looking for. \nMIRANDA \n(piecing it together) Not alone. What happened to you happened to other girls. (beat) I understand. And I'm sorry. But there is nothing I can do about it now. It has nothing to do with me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNot knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump. The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL \nBLAST. \nShe stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and immediately doubles over in pain -- \nMIRANDA \nShit. She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin. Blood already seeping from the nasty cut -- \nINT. BATHROOM \nMiranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut. And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel. Inside the room with her -- Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have STOPPED. A silent beat. She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful. And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola. She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING \nLOUDER. \nMIRANDA \nNo.   No.   No... Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMiranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt. The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again -- the image is gone. \nIt is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far corner of the room. She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank- repossessed property. The address is in Willows Creek. Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel wanted her to see. She stares at it. PUSH IN ON the picture as we -- \n", "test2_true": "EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN \nA \"FOR SALE\" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first few rays of light break through the dawn sky. Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out. She studies the house before walking up the drive. We watch her peek through windows and walk around back, looking for something. What exactly, we don't know. (Neither does she.) She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't looked. \nINT. BARN \nDark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large room, perplexed. There is something about this place. Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning her. With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her. She moves to it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAnd here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops, startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light bulb. She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below. Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs down. \nINT. SECRET BASEMENT \nMiranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness. Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall for a switch. Nothing. \nMIRANDA \n(to self) It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right? Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key- chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it. \nMIRANDA \nHello? She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half- light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named \n\"TRACY MARIE SEAVER.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nIs there anybody here?   Hello? The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation. Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before. It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are several heavy chains. Like a meat rack. And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down, tied around the hands and ankles. Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter away. \nMIRANDA \nGo away!   Fuck off! (We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an almost strobe-light effect:) She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's adrenaline at full tilt -- \nMIRANDA \nC'mon, c'mon, c'mon -- She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly, clinically. The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about; wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood. \nMIRANDA \nWake up, Tracy, wake up -- Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles. The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too late. \nEXT. BARN - LATER \nMiranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and throws up. The bright light outside blinding her momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to register -- \nTHE PATROL CAR \nparked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up and notices her. Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves. His name is TURLINGTON. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nHowdy there. He says this while already strolling over.        Miranda's mind races a mile a minute -- \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nEverything okay? \nMIRANDA \nY-yes. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nThat your vehicle, ma'am? She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet. \nMIRANDA \nYes -- I -- I just pulled over.     I was -- looking for a bathroom. Morning sickness, you know... \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nCongratulations. But I'm afraid this is private property -- you can't just waltz on in. You understand that. She nods, nerves shot to hell.     Starts walking. \nMIRANDA \nI'll be on my merry way now. My husband will never forgive me if I get a ticket for trespassing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops, whips out his gun and trains it on her -- \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nHoly shit. (clicks the safety off) Lady, stay right where you are. Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.     Freezes. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nHands up where I can see them. Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands. \nOFFICER TURLINGTON \nNice and slow, start talking to me. And make it good. Tell me just exactly who that is. A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock. Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive. But just barely. \n", "test2_id": 319, "test3_input": "PETE \nI know, I know.

Knocks twice on the hood and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive. \nMIRANDA \nThat's why Rachel picked me.    It was Doug. I'm so stupid. Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on about this time. Tries to remain professional. \nPETE \nInside, okay? \nINT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER \nLunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are, whispers something to them. They glance at the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort. Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door. An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear. \nMiranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies. And then, halfway across the room, one of the women stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together. Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them joining Chloe in clapping. \nPETE \nWhat is this? \nIRENE \nShe's a hero. Little Red Riding Hood put the big bad wolf in a coma. Pete nods.     Just what he needed.   The OFFICERS trade looks. \nOFFICER #1 \nThey're not gonna start something, are they? Irene shakes her head, amused. \nIRENE \nYou ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, Officer? The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her, mouths the words \"thank you.\" And Miranda is hauled out the side door. \nINT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL \nWhite. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse themselves. Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as well. \nORDERLY #1 \nWe'll be right outside, Doctor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOnce the doors are locked and they're alone, the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear: \nPETE \nI pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back. The best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here. Five. Under my -- \nMIRANDA \n(interrupting) Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts before this. And neither do you. Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on track: \nPETE \nBut you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. The simplest chemical deficiencies can -- \nMIRANDA \nChemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing! \nPETE \nI'm a very open-minded person, but as a doctor -- \nMIRANDA \nNo, you're not. You're a close- minded academic, just like me. You told me once that I was the most logical person you knew, remember? Well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. Rachel Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago -- tossed off the Ashley Bridge by my husband. My harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband -- that's how pathetically blind I've been. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA (CONT'D) \nAndrea White and Jenny Dixon were also abducted and murdered -- now this was before I met Doug but I bet you anything that they both went to his school. Then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions -- namely me -- delayed him from reverting to his sickness. That's why I didn't notice anything. I believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. Then along comes Tracy Seaver and he can't resist. Locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property -- She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing. \nMIRANDA \nHere's Doug's interest in real estate, Pete. Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek. \nMIRANDA \nRachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her -- she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention -- and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem. Made sure I killed Doug because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to her. And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way. Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded. \n", "test3_true": "Is that a threat? \nMIRANDA \nTo whom? \nPETE \nTo me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIRANDA \nTo you? I'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when I tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if I don't do what she wants -- she's going to kill me. Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak, but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A reminder of their very real connection. \nMIRANDA \nI need you to at least consider the possibility that I'm not insane. (beat; pleading) Not as a doctor. As the only person I trust in this world. \nEXT. NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY \nA tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car. \nDOROTHY \nI'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm doing this for Rachel. \nPARSONS \nYou're making a complete fool of yourself. Do you realize what you sound like? She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there. Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets him have it: \nDOROTHY \nWhat do I sound like, Phil? Like one of your patients? Well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me. And I've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed. BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOROTHY \nI'm losing my mind. Our daughter is gone and I miss her and I'm angry. \nShe turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car. \nINT. BANK VAULT - DAY \nA solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a moment. Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He opens it and spills the contents on the table. It is a stack of POLAROIDS. Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales, all blood draining from his face. \nEXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING \nThe sky darkens fast.     The storm moving in. \nINT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES' STATION \nTHUNDER RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle.

MIRANDA'S NEW CELL \nMiranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and the handle unfastened. Through the door comes Consuelo, carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed.

Miranda doesn't have the energy for it: \nMIRANDA \nJust fine, thank you. \nCONSUELO \nThe spirit is not fine.    She's very unhappy. What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman as if she were crazy, but things have changed. \nMIRANDA \nHow -- how do you know? \nCONSUELO \n(shuts her eyes) But she's only a girl.

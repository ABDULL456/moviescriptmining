{"test1_input": "MAX Wait a second. \nBETH Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you feel. \nMAX About what? \nBETH About me. \nMAX I, I... (EXASPERATED) Why are you doing this? Since when have you gotten \"serious\" about relationships? Your last boyfriend dumped you after four days. \nBeth sits up, pulls her jacket closed. \nBETH Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max. \nMAX No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on. \nBETH Max, I don't think this is such a good idea. I mean, it would be really foolish to jeopardize our friendship. \nMAX No, it wouldn't! \nBETH We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm sure you know it wouldn't have worked out. \nMAX I don't know that. \nBETH Please tell me we haven't hurt our friendship. You don't even know how much you mean to me. \nMAX I'm starting to get the idea. \nHe's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view. \nMAX (CONT'D) Things weren't the same after. We quickly became the kind of friends who say Hi on the paths but don't stop walking. Then, she moved across campus and changed majors, and basically, except for the random phone call, I haven't seen her in ages. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMAX, thoughtful. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \n17 INT. LIMBO RADIO 17 \nMax, speaking in the empty station, suddenly gets intense. \nMAX All these dates had one thing in common! And it took Charles, of all people, to point it out to me. \n18 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD \u00ad TODAY -- FLASHBACK 18 \nIt's late January and the campus is showing signs of a temperamental winter. \nMAX (V.O.) This morning, we were skipping class. \nMax and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first, they are only specks in the distance. \nCHARLES Max, you're insane. \nMAX It's ridiculous that even at a liberal school like this, I have to put up with anti-Semitism. \nCHARLES So you got a C minus! Don't you think you're getting carried away? \nMAX He couldn't just fail me, think about it. The paper was about my grandparents' experience in the Holocaust. \nCHARLES Your paranoia has always been out of control, but this is absurd. \nMAX You don't understand, you're not Jewish. \nCHARLES Neither are you! \nMAX But the professor probably thinks I am. \nCHARLES And wasn't that the paper that you handed in two weeks late? \nMAX You know what else? I think he might be German. \nCHARLES Professor Wang? Will you stop it... \nWe can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his head, and is wearing incongruous \"Vegas\" clothes. \nThey walk past and into the University Center. \n19 INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- CONTINUOUS 19 \nIt's a low-traffic time of day. \nCHARLES So what do you want to do tonight? \n", "test1_true": "CHARLES Have you ever noticed that the more Annie Hall you watch, the less successful you are romantically? I think we'd do much better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11. \nMAX What are you talking about? If you're sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but don't blame our sad little lives on it. \n20 INT. GENERAL STORE -- CONTINUOUS 20 \nCharles picks out breath mints. \nCHARLES No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about this over break. Ever since we started watching it, what has your love life been like? And mine? Every semester, we watch this movie, and then spend the semester alone. \nMAX Alone? Last semester you hooked up with like a dozen women. \nCHARLES You know actresses don't count. (POIGNANTLY) I'm looking for a meaningful, sophisticated relationship. Like Frank and Ava. No more shallow dames for this cat. \nMAX (AGITATED) Where did you get this grudge against my favorite film? \nCHARLES I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party. \nMAX And anyway, your theory fails to account for our collective dorkiness and bad haircuts. Plus, look at Sam. \nCHARLES Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman year, and he's in his third year with Jen. \nMAX So look at what not watching can do to you. \nCHARLES Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I was kidding. \n21 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 21 \nMAX What a nightmare. I dunno why I can't stop thinking about these things. I guess I've been a little restless lately, since getting back from winter break. Everything's been kind of weird lately. \nHe grabs a CD from a rack. \nMAX (CONT'D) Hope you enjoyed this week's Reggae Revelry Hour. This is Max filling in for Rasta Ronnie, taking you out with a little Bad Religion. \nHe puts in the CD, hits \"Shuffle/Repeat,\" and leaves. The caller request lines blink furiously. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: white on black: \"SUNDAY\" \n22 INT. COMMON ROOM -- MAX'S SUITE - EVENING 22 \nMax's dormitory suite: four bedrooms off a common room, which has three battered couches, a coffee table, and in a corner, several small fridges and two televisions in a pile. \nChristmas lights are still up. A neon `Guinness' sign dwarfs it all. \nMax and Charles are here, standing, while Sam and Jen sit on one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other. \nCharles puts on his gloves and coat. \nCHARLES Max, you're coming and that's the end of it. When's the last time you went to a party? \nMAX Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into a stranger's house and ate their food under any other circumstance, I'd be arrested. \nCHARLES I'm not taking no. With Sam on board, it's gonna be like old times. \nHe gestures at Sam, who stands. Unlike the hipster from freshman year, Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant. There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back. \nSAM Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in ages. \nJen looks up from her magazine with disapproval. \nJEN You're going out? \nSAM Aw, honey, just for a little while. \nJEN You know I have to work until midnight. It's not my fault the supervisor won't let me out of it. \nShe glares. He teeters between his friends and his girlfriend. His girlfriend wins. He sits back down, trying to hide his disappointment. \nSAM She has a point, guys. I should catch up on my chemistry reading anyway. \nThe guys roll their eyes, let down but unsurprised. \nAcross the room are SCOTT, perpetually poker-faced and reserved, and AMANDA, understated, with the subdued manner of a long-suffering wallflower. \nShe sits off to the side, sneaking looks at Scott. He's watching a golf-related infomercial. \nAMANDA So Scott... How come you're not going out with Charles and Max? \n", "test1_id": 1524, "test2_input": "55 INT. RADIO STATION 55 \nWe ZOOM OUT fast. Max is back in reality, the station crowded and claustrophobic. He tries to regroup. \nMAX (taps the mike) Hello? Uh, Julie...? (clears his throat) So, uh, as I was saying... Um. My friends. Yeah. My friends are weird. Shit. (LONG PAUSE) I think it's time for some music. \nHe grabs for a CD. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: white on black: \"THURSDAY\" \n56 INT. U.C. GENERAL STORE 56 \nMax and Charles stir their coffee. \nCHARLES Fuckin' hate this flavored shit. Anyway, I can't believe the cat in the shag jacket was Andy. \nMAX I don't want to talk about it. \nCHARLES When I knew him as a freshman, he was pre- law... Whew. Anyway, it sounds like things are going well between you and Julie. \nMAX Yeah. This is a real change of pace. Staying away from Annie Hall is like some kind of magic trick. \nCHARLES I was wondering about that. You seem different lately. \nMAX You know how when things are going badly, there are certain parts I like to watch? \nCHARLES Like how you spent your whole sophomore year watching that lobster scene on repeat? \nMAX I realized that I don't know what part to watch when things are going well. \nCHARLES You know, I actually regret mentioning that theory. In fact, Sam and I were thinking of watching it tonight. You in? \nMAX Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really like, that I may actually have a chance with, and you want me to put it all in jeopardy? \nCHARLES Come on. Watching it without you would be weird. Unnatural. That film is you, Max, face it. \nMAX But it's ruining my life. \nCharles drinks his coffee and shakes his head. \nCHARLES Listen, Max. I have to tell you something. I scored last night. \nMAX See? The theory works for you, too. \nCHARLES With Beth. \nMax drops his coffee, thunderstruck. \nMAX What?! \nCHARLES It wasn't premeditated. \nMAX (ANGRY) How could you sleep with Beth? \nCHARLES Look, nobody knows about it. It won't happen again. \nMAX Happen again? Of course not! That might constitute a relationship! \nMax is at a loss. The CASHIER looks over suspiciously. \nCHARLES I'm sorry, Max. I wasn't sure if you'd care. \nMAX I don't care! Oh God, this is my fault! If only I hadn't called her... \nCHARLES What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, man. Let me pay for your coffee. \nMAX You've gotta be kidding. \nHe starts to leave. \nCHARLES Going back to the suite? \nMAX I dunno where I'm going. \n57 EXT. CAMPUS THEATER \u00ad DAY 57 \nMax, distressed, passes the campus theater, where someone is tacking up a poster for Annie Hall. Max sees it and averts his eyes. \n58 EXT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 58 \n", "test2_true": "59 INT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 59 \nMax sees Beth eating alone at a table, reading a Tom Robbins book. He walks over. Beth isn't thrilled to see him. \nBETH Max? What are you doing here? A sudden craving for bird-seed? \nMAX Yeah. I figured I'd had enough actual food this week. \nBETH Well, be careful, someone in the corner is eating egg salad. \nMax sits down across from her. After an awkward pause: \nBETH (CONT'D) Are you okay? \nMAX Yeah, why? \nBETH No reason. Something about you sounded different. \nMAX What? Now? \nBETH No, actually, last night on the... Oh no, he's here. \nMAX But I just left him in the General Store... \nBut she isn't talking about Charles: she's looking across the room at STEVE, a good-looking guy who is talking to a GIRL. \nBETH Who is he with? He never calls me anymore. I think he might be seeing someone. Have you heard anything? \nMAX I don't even know him. What's so special about this guy, anyway? I mean, are you and he...? \nBETH Sort of. Well, no, I guess not. (DISTRACTED) I know something's going on. I'm such a fool. Why are we always attracted to people that are completely wrong for us? Is it because they excite us? \nMAX I guess so. You know, we should try to be more exciting. Like the other day, I waited until the last minute before returning a video. And next time, I swear I'm not going to rewind. \nBETH I can be a rebel too. The other day I went to bed without flossing. \nMAX Boy, are we pathetic. \nBETH Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you know? But sometimes, I feel like... \nMAX Yeah. Me too. \nShe puts on her coat and gathers her things on her tray. \nBETH I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't realize how much I missed you. \nMAX I feel the same way about the Sex Pistols. Missing them is far cooler than having them around. \nBETH That's not what I meant, Max. \nShe heads for the exit. \n60 INT. COMMON ROOM -- EVENING 60 \nSam looks dubiously at Max, who waves his arms and shouts. \nMAX What do you mean, you saw Julie with someone? \nSAM Just that. Nothing more. \nMAX So what are you saying? \nSAM Nothing. They were having lunch. \nMAX Who was he? What did he look like? \nSAM You're over-reacting. \nMAX How could she see someone else? \nSAM You're not even dating! \nMAX But we might be! I can't handle competition, Sam, I'm not the competitive type. \nSAM It was just lunch in the cafeteria. He looked completely normal. \nMAX I can't compete with that! (he fumbles with his coat) Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast. \nHe rushes out the door. \n", "test2_id": 1525, "test3_input": "SCOTT (AS \"CARTMAN\") \"Can't we all just get along?\" \nAMANDA Goddamn it, Scott, I am so sick of you making fun of me! You are the meanest person I've ever met and I don't know why anybody even talks to you! You are such an asshole! \nThey lock gazes for a beat. \nSCOTT Sorry. \nSara comes back in and sits down, sullen. There is a long, uncomfortable silence. \nA WAITER arrives. \nWAITER Are you ready to order? \nJEN SAM No. Yes. \nUnsure, he turns to the next couple. \nCHARLES SARA Yes. No. \nThe waiter looks around, notices the tension. \nWAITER Why don't I come back? \nHe leaves. Awkward silence. \nBETH (CLEARS THROAT) Ah... So... Julie. I heard you switched majors. \nJULIE Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc. \nJEN I'm a Soc. major. \nJULIE Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed something more, ya know, relevant. \nSAM Psych is relevant? \nJULIE (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE) Well, look, I'm only in college for the degree. Most of the stuff they teach us is pointless anyway. \nJulie looks at Max: Say something. \nMAX (FEEBLY) Heheh, I bet that's why they call it \"academic.\" \nJEN College is a great opportunity. It's about more than getting a job. \nJULIE Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world for as long as possible. \nCHARLES I work in theater, so this is great training for me. \nJULIE You call theater the real world? \nSARA Hey! \nNow Julie is hitting Max's leg: Help me out here! But Max is petrified, watching his worst nightmare unfold. \nJEN Some of us work really hard to get through school. \nJULIE Look, my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here. But the truth is, private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years. It's bullshit. \nAMANDA You think social work is bullshit? \nJULIE That's not what I-- \nCHARLES This \"bullshit\" is going to put me in debt for the next forty years. \nJulie punches Max in the thigh. He jumps, blinks. \nJEN Why don't you just drop out if everything's such bullshit? \nMAX So what's everybody going to order then? \nJULIE God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny college brats. \nNobody has anything more to say. Everyone looks away. Max is shell-shocked. \nTOMMY I'm gonna work for NASA! \n90 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MAX'S DORM -- NIGHT 90 \nJulie's car pulls up. Her bumper sticker: \"EAT ANIMALS, DON'T `LOVE' THEM\" \nMax opens the door, gets halfway out, turns back. \n", "test3_true": "JULIE No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to work. \nMAX It'll be fun, just the two of us. \nJulie lights a cigarette off her old one. \nJULIE Okay, see you later. \nShe peels out. \n91 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT 91 \nMax straightens up. Scott comes out of his bedroom. \nSCOTT If she stands you up, are we still not allowed in here? It's my time to watch \"South Park.\" \nMAX Why would she do that? \nSCOTT (SHRUGS) It's already past eleven. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door. \nMAX See? \nMax gets the door. Scott exits, disappointed. Julie enters, smoking. \nJULIE Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe what cross-campus traffic was like. \nMAX That's the worst excuse I ever heard. I mean it. So... you wanna hit the video store? \nJULIE No, you've got something here that I've been looking forward to all week. \nShe grabs Annie Hall from the shelf. \nMAX Ah, shit, no. \nJULIE You must face your fears. Relax, it's a very positive film. You just have to know how to look at it. It's really refreshingly positive. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n92 INT. COMMON ROOM -- 98 MINUTES LATER 92 \nThe closing credits are rolling. Max and Julie look somewhat disconcerted. \nMAX Boy, what an uplifting movie. Such a refreshingly positive message. \nShe doesn't respond. \nMAX (CONT'D) Right? \nJULIE You know, I think I prefer Manhattan. \nMAX How can you say that? Annie Hall is so uplifting! \nJULIE It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the movie tonight, but I should get going. \nMAX But it's still early. \nJulie goes to the door. Max follows. He tries to kiss her. She pulls back. \nJULIE I don't know if this is a good idea right now. \nMAX Okay, how about right... now? \nHe tries to kiss her again. She ducks it, comes back into the room, sits down. Max stands, tense. \nJULIE Listen, since the other night, I've been doing some thinking... \nMAX There's your mistake. Mindless happiness is always better than thoughtful reservation. Unless you're talking about nude bungee jumping. \nJULIE I don't think that this is a good time for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you know, together. Into a relationship. \nMAX But, but... we just saw a movie about how relationships are worth it, no matter what happens. \nJULIE Did we? \nMAX Yeah, I guess we really did. \nJULIE Well, you're right, Max, and this relationship was worth it. \n", "test3_id": 1526}

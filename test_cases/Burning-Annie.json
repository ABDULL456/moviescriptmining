{"train": "BURNING ANNIE \nart imitates life imitates art imitates life \nWritten by \nZack Ordynans \nPRODUCTION DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nAbrupt CLOSE UP on MAX, a plain wall behind him. \n1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1 \nHe is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish, or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment of un-self-consciousness. \nMAX There's an old joke. It comes from \"The Iliad,\" but I think it was popularized by Oscar Wilde. It goes like this: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the woods one day. And he sees this rabbit, also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm, cuz he's been eating Mexican. The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him. (pause, as if for applause) Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life. \nWe can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t- shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks. \nMAX (CONT'D) Growing up, my parents were huge Woody Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a part of my background that I must have been about 16 by the time I realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring the Beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation. Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I? \nAs Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view. It has the call letters of a college radio station on it. \nHigh on the wall behind him, a glowing \"ON AIR\" light is revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears cavernous and completely barren. \n2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME \u00ad FLASHBACK \u00ad DAY 2 \nYOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar. \nMAX (O.S.) Anyway, like the Beatles thing\u00ad and this is the point of that whole long-winded example\u00ad I was force-fed Woody Allen from a young age. I remember watching Bananas when I was about five. Of course, I hated it. \nYoung Max is laughing hysterically at the screen. \nMax stands to the side, watching his younger self and his father. The radio mike hangs in front of him. \nMAX (CONT'D) This is my old house. We lived here, in a dull suburb of New York, until I was ten, when we moved to a different house in a different dull suburb of New York. \nOn TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased by a group of soldiers. \nYOUNG MAX Daddy, why are they running after her? \nFATHER (KINDLY) Someday, you'll understand. Pay attention, you'll learn something. \nYoung Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed. \n3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME \u00ad FLASHBACK 3 \nIn pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing. \nMAX (V.O.) Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw Annie Hall, but it was the first time I actually appreciated it. I was flipping channels on a Saturday afternoon, and there it was, and I was stunned to find I loved it, more stunned to find that my parents may have had a point all along. [MORE] \nMAX (V.O.) (cont'd) Although, they were definitely wrong about Bananas. \nCLOSE ON: Adolescent Max, totally engrossed in the film. \n4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY \u00ad FLASHBACK 4 \nAdolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by in groups. He looks a little lost. \nMAX (V.O.) Oh God, high school. I hated this place. I was a Junior when I gave up trying to fit in. Fortunately, being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots. \nA pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He walks into a water fountain, drops his books. \n5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM \u00ad FLASHBACK 5 \nAdolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball. Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH. \nMax stands to the side and winces. \nMAX There was something in Annie Hall I identified with. Maybe it was the style of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I don't know. All I know is, I kept going back. Different people are inspired by different things, and my source of inspiration became a 20-year-old movie about a failed relationship. \nThe volleyball rolls over and he picks it up. \n6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6 \nFrom behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small, dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear. \nHe now holds a volleyball. \nMAX The pizza, of course. The paramedics took 35 minutes to arrive. \nSTACY I can't believe you! Did you get in trouble? \nMAX The Station Manager said I couldn't go on the air ever again. \nSTACY So what'd you do?! \nMAX I gave him the pizza! \nThey collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically crawls backwards. \nSTACY What? Don't you like me? \nMAX It would never work. \nSTACY How would you know? \nMAX I know. I have a sixth sense. \nSTACY You see dead people? \nMAX I see dead relationships. \nStacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined. \nMAX (CONT'D) (TO CAMERA) That was all true, but there was something else, though. I mean, there I was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the only thought running through my mind was... \n12 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD \u00ad DAY \u00ad FLASHBACK 12 \nMax speaks to someone O.S. \nMAX ...\"What about Beth?\" \nMax is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day. \nMAX (CONT'D) I mean, I know we're just friends, but you really mean a lot to me and we've been spending a lot of time together lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm saying is, maybe we could try going out on a date or something? \nBETH Max... \nMAX I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh... \nBETH Sure. \nMAX We wouldn't have to... What? \nBETH I'd love to. How's tomorrow night? \nMAX Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow night's fine. \nBETH Great. I know the perfect thing. \nShe splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune. \n13 EXT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT 13 \nMax and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats. \nBETH Never? \nMAX Not until Sam and Jen. \nBETH A perfect record. Wow. \nMAX I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week as soon as I saw you together. \nBETH But you can tell with everybody? I don't know if that's sad or incredible. \nMAX Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the only one who can tell. Take any couple. If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's conflicting priorities. If it's not that, it's usually clashing levels of self- esteem. It's always something. \nBETH Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd be afraid to bring any boyfriends home. Oh, uh, sorry. \nAwkward pause. \nMAX Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean I talk about it. I don't say a word to my suitemates. \nBETH You guys never talk about anything important anyway. \nMAX Oh, come on, we have philosophical discussions all the time. \nBETH Like whether Voltron could kill the Transformers? \nMAX Wait a second. \nBETH Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you feel. \nMAX About what? \nBETH About me. \nMAX I, I... (EXASPERATED) Why are you doing this? Since when have you gotten \"serious\" about relationships? Your last boyfriend dumped you after four days. \nBeth sits up, pulls her jacket closed. \nBETH Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max. \nMAX No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on. \nBETH Max, I don't think this is such a good idea. I mean, it would be really foolish to jeopardize our friendship. \nMAX No, it wouldn't! \nBETH We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm sure you know it wouldn't have worked out. \nMAX I don't know that. \nBETH Please tell me we haven't hurt our friendship. You don't even know how much you mean to me. \nMAX I'm starting to get the idea. \nHe's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view. \nMAX (CONT'D) Things weren't the same after. We quickly became the kind of friends who say Hi on the paths but don't stop walking. Then, she moved across campus and changed majors, and basically, except for the random phone call, I haven't seen her in ages. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMAX, thoughtful. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \n17 INT. LIMBO RADIO 17 \nMax, speaking in the empty station, suddenly gets intense. \nMAX All these dates had one thing in common! And it took Charles, of all people, to point it out to me. \n18 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD \u00ad TODAY -- FLASHBACK 18 \nIt's late January and the campus is showing signs of a temperamental winter. \nMAX (V.O.) This morning, we were skipping class. \nMax and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first, they are only specks in the distance. \nCHARLES Max, you're insane. \nMAX It's ridiculous that even at a liberal school like this, I have to put up with anti-Semitism. \nCHARLES So you got a C minus! Don't you think you're getting carried away? \nMAX He couldn't just fail me, think about it. The paper was about my grandparents' experience in the Holocaust. \nCHARLES Your paranoia has always been out of control, but this is absurd. \nMAX You don't understand, you're not Jewish. \nCHARLES Neither are you! \nMAX But the professor probably thinks I am. \nCHARLES And wasn't that the paper that you handed in two weeks late? \nMAX You know what else? I think he might be German. \nCHARLES Professor Wang? Will you stop it... \nWe can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his head, and is wearing incongruous \"Vegas\" clothes. \nThey walk past and into the University Center. \n19 INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- CONTINUOUS 19 \nIt's a low-traffic time of day. \nCHARLES So what do you want to do tonight? \nSCOTT Can't go. Graphic design work. \nAMANDA Oh really? I have work, too, but it's okay, I got a lot done today. What do you have to do? \nSCOTT Graphic design work. \nTOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses. \nTOMMY What's up, all? \nMAX Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge lizard. \nCHARLES Yeah, what are you doing tonight? \nTOMMY Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's just begun, so before the work piles up, I can party. That's why the beginning of the semester rules. \nCHARLES Great, so come party with me. \nTOMMY I can't, I have physics work. \nHe disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door. \n23 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT \u00ad LATER 23 \nA typically lame college party, still early in the night. The furniture is \"student budget modern\" type. A jazz record plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip wine and eat cheese and crackers. \nMax and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand. \nMAX Cheers to a new semester, full of potential that will surely go to waste. \nThey toast. \nCHARLES This is it, I'm telling you. This is the semester I pass all my classes and meet the dame of my dreams. \nMAX Good luck, and may she have a sister. \nCHARLES More importantly, may she grant us our occasional freedom. \nMAX Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any more than you. \nCHARLES He's become a total non-entity. Freshman year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now it's like Frank and freakin' Peter Lawford. \nMAX Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now we share a room and he's like a stranger. \nCHARLES Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her for me so it doesn't look like I'm interested. \nMAX Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall. \nCHARLES Look, all I said was, it would explain our lives. \nMAX The problem is, every crazy theory explains something. I took a class last semester with a professor who claimed that the planet is being destroyed by white, male, meat-eating capitalists. \nCHARLES So? Everybody knows that. \nMAX But she had a theory that explained how: apparently racism, sexism, socialism, environmentalism, and vegetarianism are all inherently linked. I brought a Big Mac to the first class, and I thought I was going to be the victim of a vegan- socialist uprising. \nSam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys. Excitement. \nSAM Hey! I made it! \nCHARLES I can't believe it. \nMAX Wow, the laws of nature have stopped working. Maybe I should try to meet some chicks after all. \nCHARLES How'd you get away? \nSAM I told her I was going to the lab. She doesn't mind if I'm working while she is. How's the party? \nMAX Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with this wine and cheese? What kind of party doesn't even have beer? \nCHARLES I can get into this. It's better than those frat parties. Check out the fox in the beret. \nSAM Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen, homework, and labs, I hardly have time for anything. \nCHARLES You could always change your major. You'd have a lot more free time. \nSAM I feel the same way about science that I do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. [MORE] \nSAM (CONT'D) I have doubts about both, actually. But still, what could be dumber than changing your major for a girl? \nMAX Changing your girl for a major. \nHe doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does. \nCHARLES Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in ages. Say hi for me. \n27 EXT. FRANNIE'S \u00ad DAY 27 \nMax walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an umbrella and scans the skies. \nBETH Wasn't it supposed to rain? \nMAX I dunno. \nBETH Max, it's been ten minutes and we're still discussing the weather. \nMAX So? Think of all the people who've died in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a worthy issue. \nBETH I just feel like there are other things we could be talking about. You're the one person I could rely on to say something original. \nMAX Okay, okay. (BEAT) So, what classes are you taking? \nBETH This was a mistake, wasn't it? \nMAX What? No. \nThey stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon. \nBETH Look, let's just call it a day. I was excited to hear from you, but I can't take you like this. \nA COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They hesitate. Suddenly, from inside: \nCHARLES (O.S.) Max! Beth! Come sit with us! \nMAX No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To be honest, it's nice being with someone besides my suitemates for a change. \nThey look in and see... \n28 INT. FRANNIE'S \u00ad CONTINUOUS 28 \n...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge table. They are waving them in. Beth enters, Max reluctantly follows. \nJEN Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you! \nAMANDA It's been so long! \nEveryone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but has no choice. He sits. \nJEN How did we ever fall out of touch? We shouldn't let that happen again. \nBETH I know! I even miss this place. I live on the wrong side of campus now. You guys still come here? It's so dark and the menu is tiny. \nCHARLES It never changes, that's why. \nSAM (TO JEN) What are you gonna get? \nJEN Maybe an omelet. \nMAX Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic. \nJEN So don't get the eggs. \nMAX It's just that, it's the smell. It's the smell that bothers me. \nJEN Are you serious? How can you be allergic to the smell of my eggs? \nBETH Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just incredibly picky about food. \nCHARLES Even other people's. \nMAX Look, if you're going to have eggs, let me at least switch seats with Sam, so I'll be farther away from it. \nSAM Max, what's up with you today? Join a support group. \nCHARLES If it really bothers you, why don't you and Beth switch? \nThis would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back. \nSAM What about people at other tables? Should we ask the management to stop serving egg- products to people upwind of you? \nJEN Why can't you just get along with everyone for once? \nMAX Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch. Come on, Beth, get up. \nCharles takes two mugs off the floor, throws their contents into a plant, and pours. \nTommy is on one end of a couch, sneaking looks at Amanda, in the middle, who is sneaking looks at Scott, on the other end. \nAMANDA (TO SCOTT) How was your day? \nTOMMY (ANSWERING HER) My day sucked. I spent six hours in the lab and four hours in class. And tonight, I have to study for two tests. \nCHARLES Ouch. \nTOMMY It better be worth it when I get into grad school. \nAMANDA Scott, how's the design project coming? \nSCOTT Slowly. There are a couple problems. \nAMANDA Huh. \nScott gets up and leaves the room. \nTOMMY Listen, I have an extra ticket to this concert tomorrow night. \nCharles, Sam, and Max look on with alarm: is he really going through with this, here, now? Amanda takes the bait. \nAMANDA The Ani DiFranco show? Awesome! That's been sold out for weeks! \nTOMMY It's not Ani DiFranco, it's better-- two, front row seats at the Campus Choir charity show. \nAMANDA Oh. \nTOMMY So do ya wanna go? \nAMANDA I dunno. Why don't you call me tomorrow during the day. \nTOMMY Okay, great. \nAMANDA It's getting late. See you guys later. \nSAM - MAX - CHARLES Bye. \nTOMMY See you tomorrow. \nAmanda exits. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Wow, that went pretty good. \nCHARLES Using Ani DiFranco to get laid. I've gotta try that. \nSAM She'll never give up on Scott. \nTOMMY It's not like I expect anything, I just like to spend time with her. \nScott wanders back in with a copy of Wired magazine. Tommy stands. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Scott, do you mind if I take Amanda to a concert tomorrow night? \nSCOTT Why would I? \nTOMMY I didn't think so, but not asking would be wrong. \nSCOTT No, it wouldn't. \nTOMMY But... \nSAM It's not even a date. \nTOMMY It's nothing serious, but it is a date. \nCHARLES But they're going as friends. \nSAM They are friends. \nMAX She probably won't even go. \nScott sits and reads his magazine. Tommy drops heavily into a chair. \nTOMMY Whenever you're done, someone please give me an update on my sex life. \nCHARLES How does \"sex life\" enter, if she might not be going, and if she does, it's just as friends? \nSAM Wait, can you be on a date with someone you're not dating? \nMAX No, you're thinking of Chasing Amy. \nSAM Which one had all the comic book stuff? \nMAX They both did. \nSAM What about the Star Wars stuff? \nMAX Mallrats, Clerks, and Dogma. \nSAM What about the last one? \nMAX Doesn't count, it was just an ad for all his other films. \nSAM You gotta admit, it's fucking cheap for a movie to refer to other movies. \nMAX Why? We do it real life. We're doing it right now. What you're saying is, if this was a movie, it wouldn't be any good. \nSAM Yeah. Our lives would make an awful movie. \nMAX But if our lives were a movie, you'd never be able to say that. You'd be giving the critics the perfect quote to pan it with. \nSAM So fucking what? It's a shitty movie! \nSam drops his controller and gets up. \nMAX Are you okay? \nSAM How come you only play this one video game? \nMAX Video hockey is my game. Like a swan, I mate for life. \nSAM More like the loon. \nMax looks him over. \nMAX Holy shit, you and Jen broke up. \nSAM Yeah. Your prediction finally came true. Come on, let's hit the bar. I need a drink. \n33 INT. COFFEE BAR \u00ad DAY 33 \nA crummy collegiate dive. Sam and Max drink coffees. \nMAX Okay, so what happened? \nSAM We were just hanging out, and she told me she loves me. Completely out of the blue. She says things like that sometimes, things like \"I love that you're my boyfriend,\" ya know? But usually when we're in bed or something. But this time it was different, all we were doing was watching TV. \nMAX Porn? \nSAM Almost. It was \"our\" show, the one we like to get romantic to... \n34 INT. JEN'S DORM ROOM \u00ad SAM'S FLASHBACK 34 \nSam and Jen watch \"The X-Files.\" Max stands, observing. Jen can't see him. \nSAM (TO MAX) I was just tired of trying to tell her what she wanted to hear all the time, so I tried to be honest. (TO JEN) We've been together a long time and I really care about you, but I don't know if I love you. This is tough to say, but I think something might be missing from our relationship. \nJEN Something's missing? \nSAM Well, not completely... I don't know if I can explain it. See... (FUMBLING) There are three things I look for in a girl: heart, body, and mind. And well, you've got the body. \nMax is stunned and laughs. Jen is stunned, too, and runs out. \nMAX (TO CAMERA) Jesus. You think you know someone pretty well and then they do something like this. \nSAM When she comes back, she slaps me in the face and makes me leave. Then she calls, crying, and asks me to come over. When I go back, she kicks me out and says she never wants to see me again. \nMAX Fifty bucks says there's a message on the machine when we get back. \nMax sits, and the background DISSOLVES back TO: \n35 INT. COFFEE BAR \u00ad PRESENT 35 \nSAM Is it really so bad? I couldn't lie to her. \nMAX Don't you know that no matter how often girls tell you they want honesty, they never really mean it? Nobody does! \nSAM Look, I fucked up, alright? I didn't know what to say. \nMAX It's too bad it ended like this. I'm really sorry. \nCHARLES You have no choice. If you back away now, she'll never get to see the rest of your annoying personality traits. \nMAX You're right. I can't deprive her of that. \n37 INT. THE PUB -- JULIE'S TABLE 37 \nJulie is with ANDY and MARK. Andy is your basic hippie, resplendent in a ridiculous green shag jacket. Mark has a cap and is wearing a J Crew long-sleeve shirt over a Dave Matthews Band t-shirt. \nMax approaches. \nJULIE Max! What's going on? \nMAX Hey. \nJULIE Do you guys know Max? This is Mark... \nMARK Wassup. \nJULIE ...And Andy. \nANDY Hey Max, how's it hanging, bud? \nMAX Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is that real carpet? \nANDY Yeah, man. I couldn't believe my luck when I saw it. This shade of shag is, like, so rare. I was like, woah... \nMARK Hey, are we gonna burn this or what? \nANDY Yeah, man. Hey, you guys are like all invited, if you can handle some kind bud... \"Maui wowey,\" you know? \nMAX Aloha? \n38 INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT \u00ad A LITTLE LATER 38 \nMark, Julie, and Max sit around a wooden table in a small apartment's kitchen. Andy puts on a CD. \nANDY Hey man, you like Zappa? \nMAX Dweezil or Moon Unit? \nANDY Frank. (then gets it, laughs) Man, that isn't even funny. You should check out \"Apostrophe\" some time. \nMAX \"Apostrophe\"? \nMARK It's an album. \nMAX I thought he was correcting my grammar. \nMARK Can I get anyone beers? Julie? \nJULIE Sure. \nANDY You know it. \nMAX Okay. \nMark distributes beers to everyone but Max. \nMARK Sorry, Max, we don't have enough. \nMAX Uh, yeah, sure. \nJULIE You want mine? \nMAX No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer. I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass, Killians. \nMARK (DISDAINFUL) That's so... British. \nMAX It's a coincidence, I swear. \nJulie has trouble opening her beer. Mark rushes over with his keychain. \nMARK I thought Guinness was going to be cool, but it sucks. Made me nauseous. \nANDY Dude, puking blows. That's why I smoke weed. You get high right away and no hangover! \nAndy pulls out a baggie of marijuana, and rummages through the closet. \nMAX Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm paranoid enough as it is. \nMARK Yeah, well, some people just can't handle their bud. \nJULIE No, well, a little, sure. But there are always men around. During fire drills, more guys come out than girls. Never the same ones either. They come and go. \nMAX I bet they do. \nJulie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her in the doorway. \nJULIE I had a good time tonight, but next time, let's have some real fun. \nMAX Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack Nicholson and a case of Schnapps. \nJULIE Good night, Max. \nJulie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: white on black: \"WEDNESDAY\" \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP of a schedule's column heading: \"Wednesday\" \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \n40 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE RADIO STATION \u00ad DAY 40 \nMax reads the schedule on the door. His watch says 11am; he finds Wednesday 11am: \"Julio's Death Metal Jamboree.\" He peeks behind the door-- the station is empty. \nHe starts to slip inside when... \nBETH (O.S.) Max! \nHe whirls, closing the door guiltily. Beth comes down the hall, laden with books. \nMAX Uh, hi... \nBETH It was great running into your friends, but... you know... I feel bad about what I said. Do you want to get together later? \nMAX I don't know, I'm sure I have something to do that I've forgotten. \nBETH Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of touch, but we can't even have lunch? \nMAX We had breakfast. \nBETH Every time we try to do anything, you have an excuse, or forget to show up, or you cancel. \nMAX You cancel on me, too. \nBETH I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you know, awkward. \nMAX Look, the whole thing was my fault. Let's drop it, okay? \nBeth throws up her hands, turns away. \nMAX (CONT'D) Okay, lunch, you win. \nBETH Now you're only going because I gave you a hard time. \nMAX Guilt is a powerful force. Just be glad it's on our side for once. \nBETH Okay, how is the Kidney Bean at noon? \nMAX Awful, just like every other time of day. Their food is just birdseed prepared fancy. \nBETH The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon? \nMAX Fine. \nShe leaves. Max finds his old slot on the schedule and crosses it out. Then he slips into the station. \n41 EXT. CVS 41 \nA shitbox pulls up. Sam drives, Max rides shotgun. Scott and Amanda are in back. \nAMANDA And then I got to thinking, you know, I really think I like vanilla. \nSam turns off the car. \nSAM I'll be right back. \nMAX Me too. \nSAM I'll be right back. \nMAX Me too. \nThey leave. \nAmanda and Scott are alone in the back. Amanda looks tense. \nAMANDA Scott, can I ask you something? \nSCOTT Okay. \nAMANDA It's just that, sometimes, you're really cool and other times you act like I'm not even here. Or like you don't want me around. \nSCOTT Yeah. \nAMANDA Well, I was wondering if... never mind. \nSCOTT Okay. \nA moment passes. \nAMANDA All right, look, I'm just going to come right out with it. I think I like you. I think I, I really like you. \nSCOTT I know. \nAs she opens her mouth, Scott opens the car door and exits. \n44 INT. CVS \u00ad PRESENT 44 \nSCOTT So where are the socks? \n45 INT. PUB \u00ad THAT NIGHT 45 \nAn absurd metal band plays on-stage. The room is packed, and the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit. \nMax wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here awhile. \nJULIE Hey! \nMAX Oh, hey! It's good to see you. \nThe surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting off on the energy of the room. \nThe SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm. \nMAX (CONT'D) Who are these guys? \nJULIE They're Anhedonia. They're \"sludge-core.\" \nSINGER You're all a part of the conspiracy! You're all human! Every one of you wore diapers! You're all full of shit! \nThe singer storms off. The band follows. The crowd applauds with some confusion. Julie whistles loudly and claps. \nJULIE That's their trademark. They insult the crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in. We were lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes. \nMAX Luck had nothing to do with it. \nJULIE Look, the mike's not even broken. They were just tired of playing, but they wanted to give us something to remember. Now that's showmanship. \nMAX You have to wonder about any band whose highlight is their exit. \nJULIE It worked for The Who. \nMAX I'm sorry, the who? \nJULIE Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a joke a celebrity DJ would make? \nMAX I still can't believe you tuned in. It's like an invasion of privacy. \nJULIE You're a riot. Let's get out of here. \nShe pulls him away. \n46 INT. STUDY LOUNGE \u00ad UNIVERSITY CENTER \u00ad MINUTES LATER 46 \nThe lounge is empty. Julie sits on a couch. Max sits next to her, but seems uptight about getting too close. \nMAX So, uh, I'm sorry about that thing with, uh, Chip was it? \nJULIE Oh, Mark. He's been following me around for years. He's easily threatened. \nJULIE Sounds perfect. \nThey walk out. \nMAX Say, did that guy look like...? \nJULIE Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that too. \n47 INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT 47 \nMax is relaxed and chatting while Julie drives. \nMAX I've been able to do it since high school. \nJULIE That's a scary gift. I mean, even if people are destined to break up, the will to stay together is very powerful. \nMAX That's the real tragedy. Look at all the unhappy couples in the world. \nJULIE I don't know if your gift is really that special, Max. I mean, we break up with everyone we ever date... Until the one we stay with forever. \nMAX See how ridiculous dating is? \nJULIE How did you get this attitude if you love Annie Hall? \nMAX What do you mean? That's what Annie's all about. \nJulie looks dubious. Max flicks on the radio. \nDJ ...\"college radio for the masses,\" and that's it for me. (sound of CDs falling) Whoops! Anyway, next up is Verbal Diarrhea, with Todd Duke. \nMAX Why is your radio set to the campus station? \nJULIE Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I first heard your show. \nMAX I thought Beth told you about me. \nJULIE It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met you, your show's not important. \n48 INT. PRETENTIOUS CAFE \u00ad A LITTLE LATER 48 \nThe kind of place that's perfect for Parents Weekend. At this late hour, it is filled with young professionals. There's a dance floor, where couples dance to the standards. Max and Julie are at a table in the corner, looking out of place. \nJULIE (SMIRKING) This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting mix of people here, you've got these men with their suits, taking their waitress girlfriends out to impress them into bed, because they can't get them any other way. Really, as if a fast car can ever make up for a small dick. \nMAX If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski mask and an Uzi. \nJULIE Guys, always obsessed with dick size. \nMAX Well, sure, there's that, but it would also be nice to have a car with a heater. \nJULIE Let's guess which couples are destined to break up. How about them? \nIndicates a COUPLE dancing. \nMAX No, I can't tell just by looking. I need some info. \nTheir waitress, DONNA, arrives. \nJULIE Hi! Do you have a boyfriend? \nMax is aghast. Donna stares a beat. \nDONNA Yeah. \nJULIE (TO MAX) What do you need to know? \nMAX Uh, just a description. \nJULIE Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a psyche major. \nDONNA Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny. Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God. Has a sweet tooth. Uh... \nMAX That's plenty. \nDONNA So can I take your order? \nJULIE We're not ready, thanks. \nDonna puts her pad away. \nDONNA So what was that all about then? \n61 INT. DORM HALLWAY \u00ad SHELLY HALL 61 \nMax knocks on the door to Julie's suite. Nothing. He paces, frustrated. Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell. \nJUDY Hello? Can I help you? \nMAX Yeah, do you know where Julie is? \nJUDY Hey! Are you Max? \nMAX Yeah... \nJUDY Oh wow! You're just like she described. Hi, I'm Judy. I'm sure she mentions me all the time. \nMAX Oh, yeah, Judy. Right. \nJudy unlocks the door and holds it open. \nJUDY Come in, come in. Make yourself at home. \nMAX Uh, thanks. \n62 INT. JULIE'S SUITE 62 \nMax enters cautiously. The common room couldn't be more different than his own, clean and tasteful. \nJudy hangs her coat up. \nJUDY This may be completely inappropriate, but can I ask you something? The tattoo\u00ad did it hurt? \nMAX (THINKING FAST) Uhhhh... No! I mean, not much. \nJUDY Why didn't you use your frat's logo? \nMAX Well, uh, the guy said it's too hard to draw two grown men kissing. Say, which one is Julie's room? \nJUDY On the left. She's got the single. \nMax pushes Julie's door open with one hand while keeping an eye on the front door. \nMAX So...! Uh, do I come here often, would you say? \nJUDY (O.S.) What? \nThe front door opens and Julie enters. \nJULIE Max! What are you doing here? \nMAX Judy let me in! \nJudy comes out of her room. \nJUDY You know, I think I'm going to get a tattoo, too. \nJULIE Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max. \nJUDY What? You're Max? \nJULIE Yeah, isn't he great? \nJUDY Sure. \nGlaring at him, she goes into her room and closes the door. \nJULIE What a surprise! What brings you here? \nMAX I was, uh, in the area and thought I'd pop in. Find out how your day went. \nJULIE It was excellent, how was yours? \nMAX Great. I had lunch with a dear, dear friend. \nJULIE Yeah? Anyone I know? \nMAX Probably not. She's a foreign exchange student. Spends a lot of time modeling. \nJULIE Really? \nMAX Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone. We had, uh, quite a lunch. Lots of shellfish, and wine. And, uh, rhino's horn. \nJULIE For lunch? \nCHARLES Not if you count this huge purse she had. She was rummaging through it and finally had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out of that thing. Anyway, it made me think of Annie Hall. \nMAX Oh, great. \nCHARLES Although Julie dresses better. \nMax slowly lowers his controller. \nMAX What are you saying, I like her because she's like Annie Hall? \nCHARLES I didn't say that. \nMAX Oh my God, I think you're right. \nCHARLES I didn't say that. \nMAX I don't want to like someone because she reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't. \nCHARLES Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes. \nSam returns, sees what they are playing. \nSAM Look at you two. Wouldn't something else be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye? \nCHARLES Great game. \nMAX No. I don't know how to play it. \nSAM Lucky for you, I actually have time to teach you. Normally I would be having lunch with Jen. \nMAX Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch! \nMax gets up and runs out. Charles and Sam exchange a look. \nSAM Man, he'll do anything to avoid change, won't he? \n70 INT. THE FABULOUS DINER \u00ad DAY 70 \nBeth is alone, working on a salad. Max runs up and jumps into the booth. \nBETH (not looking up) So glad you could make it. \nMAX Hey, I'm here, right? \nBETH Thank God for small favors. \nMAX I'm sorry. Are you still upset about the thing with Steve? \nBETH Yeah, a little. This semester isn't shaping up too well. It's tough getting back into the groove of things and, you know, being on campus. Yourself? \nMAX Well, you know. Nothing even worth mentioning. \nBETH But there's something? Really? \nMAX It's nothing. \nBETH Who is it? Do I know her? \nMAX Actually, um, yeah, it's Julie. \nBETH Julie! She's great. Why aren't you thrilled? \nMAX Well, I'm not sure I'm that into her. \nBETH This I gotta hear. \nMAX She reminds everyone of Annie Hall. \nBETH Well, of course, why do you think I sent her to you? \nMAX God, I'm such an idiot! That film is finding more and more ways to ruin my life. \nMax pounds his head against the table but Beth is amused. \nBETH What're you talking about? \nMAX Look at my life. Look at this thing with Julie. \nBETH Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or maybe, the Millennium Edition. \nMAX The worst part is, maybe I knew this all along. \nBut if I did I would kneel down and ask Him Not to intervene When it came to you \n77 EXT. STREET -- SUNRISE 77 \nA boy and a girl hold hands as they cross an icy street. \n78 EXT. QUAD -- SUNRISE 78 \nSquirrels play in the light. \n79 EXT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- SUNRISE 79 \nThe sun reflects off the University Center windows and back onto the snow. \nNot to touch a hair on your head To leave you as you are But if He felt He had to direct you Direct you into my arms... \n80 INT. RADIO STATION 80 \nThe lights are low. Max is at the console, staring into space. Nick Cave is playing softly on the monitors. \nInto my arms... oh Lord... Into my arms... oh Lord... \nThe phone RINGS. Max snaps out of his reverie and stares at it in horror. After several rings, he answers it. \nMAX Hello. Nobody is here right now. Please leave a message. BEEEEEEEP. \nSPLIT SCREEN between Max and \n81 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 81 \nJulie, in bed, smoking. \nJULIE Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the way. \nMAX You're listening? I told you not to listen! \nJULIE Come on, you're funny, you have good taste in music... \nMAX Hey, where'd the music go? \n82 INT. DORM ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 82 \nTwo STUDENTS, lying in bed together, listen to the radio. \nJULIE (O.S.) (on the radio) I don't know. \nMAX (O.S.) (on the radio) I don't get it, it stopped when I picked up the phone. \n83 INT. RADIO STATION -- CONTINUOUS 83 \nMax pushes up a slider and hears the following coming out over the monitors: \nJULIE (O.S.) I'm just calling to say that you left your underpants and took mine. \nMax reacts, then SCREECHING FEEDBACK rips over the airwaves. \nMAX Woah! \nContinue SPLIT SCREEN with \n84 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 84 \nWhere Julie is frantically pulling the chord out of the back of her radio. \nMax fades the phone out, the music up. \nMAX Don't be too proud of your five seconds of fame. More people would hear us if we shouted out the window. \nJULIE My radio days are over, I'm now deaf. \nMAX Didn't I tell you not to listen to my show? \nJULIE You were only playing music. \nMAX Well, all these songs are about you. \nJULIE Wow... You're a real piece of work, you know that, Max? \n85 INT. MAX AND SAM'S ROOM \u00ad MORNING 85 \nMax enters and takes off his coat. Sam sits up, annoyed. \nSam comes in, totally morose. Silently, he joins them in three-player mode, then quickly kills himself with a rocket launcher. \nMAX You just came from Jen's, huh? \nSAM Yeah, we just broke up for good. \nCHARLES Oh, man, I'm sorry. Was it you or her? \nSAM Me. Us. Both. It was just time, I guess. (puts down the joystick) I have to go, uh, mail a letter or something. \nHe puts on his coat and leaves. Charles, Tommy, and Max exchange looks. Max turns off the game. \nMAX Well, that took the wind out of my sails. \nCHARLES (NOTICING TOMMY) What's up with you? Got another date with Amanda? \nTOMMY It wasn't a date. \nCHARLES A no-show, huh? \nTOMMY Yeah, but it's okay. Today's her birthday, and she invited me out for dinner at a nice restaurant. \nCHARLES She invited all of us. \nTOMMY Oh? Well, that's cool, too. \nMAX It's barely lunch, why are you dressed up? \nTOMMY I don't want to wait til the last minute to pick out my clothes. \nCHARLES Are you really wearing that tie? \nTOMMY Damn, I knew this was the wrong one! \nHe runs into his room. Charles laughs at him. \nMAX I don't wanna go to a birthday party. I'm broke, and I wanna hang out with Julie. \nCHARLES So take her. And pray Sara's not there. \n87 EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT \u00ad EVENING 87 \nMax and Julie walk through the snow together, toward a parking lot. She's taking deep drags off a cigarette. \nJULIE This has been some crazy week. I still have a six page paper due Monday. \nMAX Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced, in 14 point type, that's only like 500 words. If a picture's worth a thousand words, that's like a bad photocopy. \nJULIE Don't worry about it, I needed a break. Good to get out and enjoy the weather. \nMAX What are you, from Maine? \nJULIE No. \nMAX Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able to handle something like that. That's a hard thing to drop on a person. \nJULIE I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far from Canada. \nMAX Shit, I'm sorry. \nJULIE It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had a few close friends. That's all you need. It's quiet up there, dull but nice. \nMAX It sounds it. \nThey get to her car, and he surprises her by kissing her. She responds, after a hesitation. \n88 INT. JULIE'S CAR \u00ad EVENING 88 \nMax sits tensely in the passenger seat. \nMAX Look out for that truck! \nThe truck's about two blocks away. \nJULIE Will you relax? I know how to drive. \nMAX Watch the driveway! \nJULIE (ANNOYED) I've got it under control, Max! \nMAX Anyway, everyone's dying to meet you. \nSCOTT (AS \"CARTMAN\") \"Can't we all just get along?\" \nAMANDA Goddamn it, Scott, I am so sick of you making fun of me! You are the meanest person I've ever met and I don't know why anybody even talks to you! You are such an asshole! \nThey lock gazes for a beat. \nSCOTT Sorry. \nSara comes back in and sits down, sullen. There is a long, uncomfortable silence. \nA WAITER arrives. \nWAITER Are you ready to order? \nJEN SAM No. Yes. \nUnsure, he turns to the next couple. \nCHARLES SARA Yes. No. \nThe waiter looks around, notices the tension. \nWAITER Why don't I come back? \nHe leaves. Awkward silence. \nBETH (CLEARS THROAT) Ah... So... Julie. I heard you switched majors. \nJULIE Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc. \nJEN I'm a Soc. major. \nJULIE Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed something more, ya know, relevant. \nSAM Psych is relevant? \nJULIE (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE) Well, look, I'm only in college for the degree. Most of the stuff they teach us is pointless anyway. \nJulie looks at Max: Say something. \nMAX (FEEBLY) Heheh, I bet that's why they call it \"academic.\" \nJEN College is a great opportunity. It's about more than getting a job. \nJULIE Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world for as long as possible. \nCHARLES I work in theater, so this is great training for me. \nJULIE You call theater the real world? \nSARA Hey! \nNow Julie is hitting Max's leg: Help me out here! But Max is petrified, watching his worst nightmare unfold. \nJEN Some of us work really hard to get through school. \nJULIE Look, my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here. But the truth is, private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years. It's bullshit. \nAMANDA You think social work is bullshit? \nJULIE That's not what I-- \nCHARLES This \"bullshit\" is going to put me in debt for the next forty years. \nJulie punches Max in the thigh. He jumps, blinks. \nJEN Why don't you just drop out if everything's such bullshit? \nMAX So what's everybody going to order then? \nJULIE God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny college brats. \nNobody has anything more to say. Everyone looks away. Max is shell-shocked. \nTOMMY I'm gonna work for NASA! \n90 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MAX'S DORM -- NIGHT 90 \nJulie's car pulls up. Her bumper sticker: \"EAT ANIMALS, DON'T `LOVE' THEM\" \nMax opens the door, gets halfway out, turns back. \nMAX Was? Is. Wait... Oh, shit! \nMax covers his face, breathes deep. \nJULIE Are you okay? Will you please calm down? I like you very much, but I told you, I just got out of a serious relationship, and it ended really badly. We saw each other almost every day at the beginning, but by the end of the semester, I hadn't seen him in a month. He stopped returning my calls and stuff, and I mean, he basically avoided me, then I heard he was seeing one of my friends. \nMAX But that was him, not me. \nJULIE It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've been trying but it's hard. Relationships are very difficult to maintain. There are so few successful couples. \nMAX What's successful? Like, my parents have been married thirty years, but-- \nJULIE My parents are divorced. \nMAX Okay, bad example. But why think ahead? We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our time together? \nJULIE Max, I did, believe me. \nMAX What was all this, I mean, was any of it\u00ad \nJULIE I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late. \nMAX But it might lead to... happiness. \nTommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the TV and sits down. Max stares at him. Tommy suddenly realizes he isn't alone. \nTOMMY Uh, re-run. \nHe turns it off and quickly exits. Max tries to pull himself together. \nJULIE Say something. Are you okay? \nMAX I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did I listen to Charles instead of Annie? \nJULIE Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie. \nMAX What are you talking about? It's a fucking textbook. \nShe stands. \nJULIE You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you. \nMAX I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye. \nJulie leaves. The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects. Max stares at it, upset and thoughtful. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: white on black: \"SUNDAY\" \n93 INT. COMMON ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 93 \nPAN left to right across people's chests: an X-Files shirt, a lounge shirt with a wide collar, a Stephen Hawking shirt, an Ani DiFranco shirt... \nPULL BACK to reveal, l to r, Sam, Charles, Tommy and Amanda, sprawled on the couches, from Max's POV in the doorway. \nThey're drinking vodka out of coffee mugs. The TV is on but the sound is off. Everyone looks tired and sad. \nMax sits. Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American. \nSAM Why are humans smarter than chimps if we have 99% of the same genetic material? \nMAX Who says we're smarter? \nSAM Look who I'm asking. You think a red blood cell is a prison for a gang member. \nMAX Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned anything useful in my classes, I'd be rubbing it in your face. \nIn Scott's usual spot is Amanda and Tommy. \nTOMMY So Amanda. Have a good weekend? \nAMANDA Yeah. \nTOMMY Mine was good too. Get any good birthday presents? \nAMANDA Yeah. \nShe gets up and leaves the room. \nSAM By the way, Max, what ever happened with that girl you were seeing? \n", "test1_input": "CHARLES Charles. I'm an actor. \nJULIE (TO MAX) You okay? You look like you're in pain. \nMAX You don't get it, I can't do my show if I even suspect someone is listening. Now I have to change time slots. Again. \nJULIE I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to listen. \nMAX (INCONSOLABLE) No, it's no good, the whole episode is ruined. This is a disaster. \nCHARLES I work in theater a lot. \nJULIE Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show actually kind of sucked. \nMAX What?! \nJULIE Just kidding! It was awesome. \nCHARLES I also direct. \nMAX Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know which episode you ruined. \nJULIE At one point you dialed a phone sex line. It was hilarious. It's not every day someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss politics. \nSam quickly pulls Charles away as he starts to comment. \nMAX And she hung up. \"This isn't the place for that kind of talk...\" \nJULIE Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a minute, you should talk about whatever you want. You know the country's in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her. \nMAX Perhaps she'd been screwed by politicians. Phone sex is just pretend but politics... I know my ass is still sore. \nHe catches himself and falters. Julie notices something. \nJULIE Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over- protective friends. It was nice meeting you, though. \nMAX Wait, wait. How did you know about my show? \nJULIE Someone mentioned you. \nMAX Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would have to be someone I know. \nJULIE It was from a good source. I was told I'd like you, but to really know you, I should hear your show. \nMAX What, really? \nShe appraises him for a beat. \nJULIE It was Beth. \nAnd with that, she leaves. Max watches her, loses her in the crowd. Something catches his eye across the room. \nMAX'S POV: Sam is in a corner, trapped by an upset Jen. From his gestures, he is on the defensive. \nCharles moseys over. \nCHARLES Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out of work, so she went to the lab to surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and then Tommy gave away that he was here. \nMAX Busted. \nCHARLES And how. Let's bail before the beheadings begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later. \nThey put on their coats. \nMAX How can you stand that show? \nCHARLES I told you, it's research. It's why I got three phone numbers, Max, while you were talking to that cutie. \n24 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT STAIRWELL 24 \nMAX \"Cutie\"? \nCHARLES That's right. You get her name? \nMAX We just met. I was working up to it. \nCHARLES Man, you're worse at picking up chicks than me. We are one sad couple of bozos. \nMax looks at him like he's insane. \n25 INT.

Anyway, uh, just checking in, I guess. Hope your break was okay. Uh, and---- \nBEEEEEEEP. The machine cuts her off. Max sighs, picks up the phone, dials. \nMAX Hello? Beth?... Sorry... Hello...? Hey, how's it going?... Yeah, in person... Too long... So anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and also, stop telling people to listen to my show... Of course I'm serious... Stop laughing... Of course I haven't changed... \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: white on black: \"MONDAY\" \n26 INT. COMMON ROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING 26 \nSara sleeps on a couch. Charles, wearing only boxers, hung over and mostly asleep, passes through the living room. He stubs his toe and crashes into the wall. \nCHARLES Ow! Shit! Ow! \nHe continues into the bathroom. Sara wakes up and looks around groggily. A FLUSH. Charles walks out of the bathroom and blinks at Sara with surprise. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um... \nSARA It's all right, this isn't the first time this has happened. At least this time I'm not the naked one. \nCHARLES It's just that, I mean, I'm just surprised to see you here. \nSARA Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you came back, or something. I was planning to go home, but I guess I fell asleep. \nShe waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She reluctantly gets to her feet. \nSARA (CONT'D) Anyway, I, uh, I've got a bunch of stuff to do. I'll see you later. \nCHARLES Bye. \nAs she leaves, Max comes in, still in last night's clothes. \nMAX You all right? \nCHARLES She's around all the time! I chose to live with my hombres, not her. She's got to realize that we're not right for each other and get on with her life. \nMAX No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or something. \nCHARLES Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe. \nMAX That sucks. Bad way to start the day. \nCHARLES The toe's the least of it. \nMAX This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you were complaining about not having any girls. Now you're complaining because you have one. \nCHARLES I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted to her once, too. What happened? \nMAX Want me to tell you? \nCHARLES No! I think I've heard enough from the Nostradamus of failed relationships to last a lifetime. \nMAX Speaking of failed relationships, I was thinking about your Annie Hall theory. Specifically, I was thinking that you're insane. \nCHARLES I said I was joking, so why do you keep bringing it up? \nMAX It's like you insulted my religion. Like, \"Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be why you're not getting laid...\" \nCHARLES Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be more fun. \nMAX It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest about the futility of romance. \nCHARLES You're just a wuss. The very thought of not seeing that movie scares you. You're like a junkie, you need movie methadone. Like, from now on you can only see Manhattan. \nMAX Forget it, I hate Manhattan. \nCHARLES You think addicts like Methadone? \nMAX My Uncle Harry didn't seem to mind. \nCHARLES So what are we doing for lunch? \nScott enters. \nSCOTT You mean breakfast. \nMAX Actually, I'm supposed to eat with Beth. \n", "test2_input": "55 INT.

Anyway, it sounds like things are going well between you and Julie. \nMAX Yeah. This is a real change of pace. Staying away from Annie Hall is like some kind of magic trick. \nCHARLES I was wondering about that. You seem different lately. \nMAX You know how when things are going badly, there are certain parts I like to watch? \nCHARLES Like how you spent your whole sophomore year watching that lobster scene on repeat? \nMAX I realized that I don't know what part to watch when things are going well. \nCHARLES You know, I actually regret mentioning that theory. In fact, Sam and I were thinking of watching it tonight. You in? \nMAX Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really like, that I may actually have a chance with, and you want me to put it all in jeopardy? \nCHARLES Come on. Watching it without you would be weird. Unnatural. That film is you, Max, face it. \nMAX But it's ruining my life. \nCharles drinks his coffee and shakes his head. \nCHARLES Listen, Max. I have to tell you something. I scored last night. \nMAX See? The theory works for you, too. \nCHARLES With Beth. \nMax drops his coffee, thunderstruck. \nMAX What?! \nCHARLES It wasn't premeditated. \nMAX (ANGRY) How could you sleep with Beth? \nCHARLES Look, nobody knows about it. It won't happen again. \nMAX Happen again? Of course not! That might constitute a relationship! \nMax is at a loss. The CASHIER looks over suspiciously. \nCHARLES I'm sorry, Max. I wasn't sure if you'd care. \nMAX I don't care! Oh God, this is my fault! If only I hadn't called her... \nCHARLES What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, man. Let me pay for your coffee. \nMAX You've gotta be kidding. \nHe starts to leave. \nCHARLES Going back to the suite? \nMAX I dunno where I'm going. \n57 EXT. CAMPUS THEATER \u00ad DAY 57 \nMax, distressed, passes the campus theater, where someone is tacking up a poster for Annie Hall. Max sees it and averts his eyes. \n58 EXT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 58 \n", "test2_true": "59 INT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 59 \nMax sees Beth eating alone at a table, reading a Tom Robbins book. He walks over. Beth isn't thrilled to see him. \nBETH Max? What are you doing here? A sudden craving for bird-seed? \nMAX Yeah. I figured I'd had enough actual food this week. \nBETH Well, be careful, someone in the corner is eating egg salad. \nMax sits down across from her. After an awkward pause: \nBETH (CONT'D) Are you okay? \nMAX Yeah, why? \nBETH No reason. Something about you sounded different. \nMAX What? Now? \nBETH No, actually, last night on the... Oh no, he's here. \nMAX But I just left him in the General Store... \nBut she isn't talking about Charles: she's looking across the room at STEVE, a good-looking guy who is talking to a GIRL. \nBETH Who is he with? He never calls me anymore. I think he might be seeing someone. Have you heard anything? \nMAX I don't even know him. What's so special about this guy, anyway? I mean, are you and he...? \nBETH Sort of. Well, no, I guess not. (DISTRACTED) I know something's going on. I'm such a fool. Why are we always attracted to people that are completely wrong for us? Is it because they excite us? \nMAX I guess so. You know, we should try to be more exciting. Like the other day, I waited until the last minute before returning a video. And next time, I swear I'm not going to rewind. \nBETH I can be a rebel too. The other day I went to bed without flossing. \nMAX Boy, are we pathetic. \nBETH Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you know? But sometimes, I feel like... \nMAX Yeah. Me too. \nShe puts on her coat and gathers her things on her tray. \nBETH I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't realize how much I missed you. \nMAX I feel the same way about the Sex Pistols. Missing them is far cooler than having them around. \nBETH That's not what I meant, Max. \nShe heads for the exit. \n60 INT. COMMON ROOM -- EVENING 60 \nSam looks dubiously at Max, who waves his arms and shouts. \nMAX What do you mean, you saw Julie with someone? \nSAM Just that. Nothing more. \nMAX So what are you saying? \nSAM Nothing. They were having lunch. \nMAX Who was he? What did he look like? \nSAM You're over-reacting. \nMAX How could she see someone else? \nSAM You're not even dating! \nMAX But we might be! I can't handle competition, Sam, I'm not the competitive type. \nSAM It was just lunch in the cafeteria. He looked completely normal. \nMAX I can't compete with that! (he fumbles with his coat) Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast. \nHe rushes out the door. \n", "test3_input": "MAX Ummm, no. \nJULIE Isn't that it on the end there? \nMAX No. \nJULIE Sure it is. \nMAX Um, no, it's just the box. The tape inside is wrestling. \nJULIE No, it isn't. \nMAX Um, it's been recorded over... \nJULIE You don't believe your friend's theory, right? \nMAX No, of course not. \nJULIE Because it's insulting. A cop-out. \nMAX I, I know, it's just, I watched it last week. How about Airplane? \nJULIE Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall. \nMax puts in Airplane. Julie and Max sit on a couch together. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n73 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT -- LATER 73 \nAirplane plays. Julie and Max share a blanket. Max turns toward Julie just as she turns toward him, and their lips end up in the same place. Julie pulls back. \nJULIE What are you\u00ad? \nMAX Huh? \nJULIE Why did you back away? \nMAX Why did you? \nJULIE It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed away. \nMAX Really? I'll, I'll have to remember that later. \nMax turns back to the movie. A beat passes. Julie looks at him, amused. \nMAX (CONT'D) Actually, my memory's not what it used to be. If I don't act on this information now... \nThey kiss. Max pulls the blanket up over them. The sound of KISSING. Then: \nJULIE Ow. \nMAX Sorry. \nJULIE No, it's okay. \nMore KISSING. \nMAX Are you comfortable, I mean, is this okay? \nJULIE It's okay. Shut up already. \nSuddenly, the sound of a LOCK TURNING. Max and Julie quickly get out from under the covers. Sam and Tommy enter, oblivious to the quick recovery of innocence on the couch. \nTOMMY You're crazy! You know how important your sense of smell is? \nSAM Come on! What about touch? Missing the smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to not being able to enjoy sex. (SEEING THEM) Oh, hey, Max. \nMAX Hey. Guys, um, this is Julie. Julie, this is my roommate Sam, and that's Tommy, who also lives here. \nJULIE Nice to meet you guys, but I was just leaving. \nMAX What? \nJULIE I have work to do before class tomorrow. \nMAX But the movie is... Okay. Do you want me to walk you home? \nJULIE Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you. \nMax leaves with Julie. \n", "test3_true": "74 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 74 \nMax and Julie collapse onto the pillows, exhausted from sex. Her room is extremely disorganized, decorated in an idiosyncratic mix of punk rock icons and nature scenery. \nJULIE I wish I had a cigarette. \nMAX I wish I smoked. \nJULIE Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys smoke. \nMAX Yeah, and it's the only thing between me and my dream of becoming Steve McQueen. \nThey lie in each other's warmth, under the blanket. \nJULIE So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh? \nMAX You call that pillow talk? (SHRUGS) We used to be. There were times I would have been lost without her. Other times, it was like the lost leading the lost. \nJULIE She really cares about you. \nMAX We tried something once, but it was a disaster. \nJULIE It's great that you're still friends. \nMAX Sometimes I'm not sure if I have a say in it. On a campus this small, it's like she's everywhere. \nJULIE Sometimes this place annoys me. There's so much bullshit. My semester off was the right idea. What happened to old- fashioned hard work? \nMAX That's what summers are for. The school year is for reckless debauchery. \nMax looks at the clock. \nMAX (CONT'D) Jesus, I have to get going. I'll never get my homework done if I sleep all weekend. Ah, fuck it, who cares. \nJULIE Why not just set your tuition on fire? \nMAX This, coming from the girl who thinks college is bullshit. \nMax just lies there, comfortably resting with a small smile. \nJULIE So, get on up, lazy. \nMax sits up and puts one foot on the floor before realizing he'll be naked if he stands. He tries to grab his jeans with his toes. Julie observes him dryly. \nJULIE (CONT'D) How can you be shy, after, you know...? \nMAX It's different. Some things aren't quite as impressive in the light of day. \nJULIE You have a problem with nudity. \nMAX Of course not. I'm a big fan of it. \nMax picks up his pants. Julie taps him on the shoulder and flicks the sheet up to flash him. He starts and drops them. She laughs. \nJULIE It's too easy. \nMax puts his jeans on, shoves his underwear and socks in his pocket. \nMAX What are you doing tomorrow? \nJULIE A double-shift, I get out at five. This week's gonna suck. I have homework that can't be avoided. \nMAX The worst kind. \nMax is dressed. They smooch. Max leaves. Julie lies in bed, thoughtful. \nNick Cave begins to croon \"Into My Arms\"... \n75 EXT. JULIE'S DORM -- SUNRISE 75 \nMax leaves the building and stops to look at the winter sunrise. \nSUPER: black on white: \"SATURDAY\" \nI don't believe In an interventionist God But I know, darling That you do \n76 EXT. LIBRARY -- SUNRISE 76 \nStudents work in the library as light refracts through icicles in the window. \n"}

LISA Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away. 
PAUL You're not serious. 
LISA Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him. 
60 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- STAIRWELL. NIGHT. 60 
Lisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace. She sees Darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of a dark hallway. She walks over' to him and crouches down. 
60 CONTINUED: 60 
LISA Hey... You know I really love you, right? 
DARREN Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute. 
LISA I guess I'm not very consistent. 
DARREN I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly. 
- LISA I gotta go home. 
DARREN 
OK... 
61 INT. RAMON'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 61 
Joan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps. 
RAMON (O.C.) Joan? Are you all right? 
JOAN Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door. 
62 OMIT 62 
63 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS. DAY. 63 
The. last students file out except Lisa. Mr. Aaron is erasing the blackboard. 
MR AARON Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa? 
LISA Are you still mad at me about the test? 
MR AARON What's going on, Lisa? 
64 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS - A FEW MINUTES LATER. DAY. 64 
Lisa and Mr Aaron sit at his desk. 
64 CONTINUED: 64 
LISA .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place. 
MR AARON What does your being rich have to do with anything? 
LISA You know what I mean. 
- MR AARON No, I don't. 
LISA Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver. 
MR AARON OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed. 
LISA Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door. 
MR AARON Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes. 
LIONEL I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe. 
MR AARON You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door. 
MR AARON (CONT'D) All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school... 
64 CONTINUED: (2) 64 
LISA I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little. 
64A TIME PERMITTING. 64A 
65 EXT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY. 65 
Through a window we see Mr Aaron and Lisa talking (MOS). 
66 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 66 
Lisa is watching TV. Joan comes in dressed for the opera. 
JOAN Does this-make me look fat? 
LISA Um, a little. 
JOAN Well, there's nothing I can do about it. 
LISA Where are you going? 
JOAN The opera...! 
LISA Why are you going to the opera? 
JOAN It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime. 
LISA Uh, no thanks. 
JOAN Why not? I bet you'd like it. 
LISA I don't like that kind of singing. 
JOAN But you like classical music. 
LISA Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing. 
66 CONTINUED: 66 
JOAN LISA But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting. 
JOAN Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute. 
LISA OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it. 
JOAN What is the matter with you? 
LISA Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera! 
JOAN Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!" 
LISA I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times! 
JOAN OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon. 
LISA Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think. 
JOAN Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that? 
LISA I guess you would. Withdrawn. 
66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 
JOAN Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you? 
LISA Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!

CHARLIE Yeah. I guess so. 
ARNOLD (stiff with liquor) Eddie -- Eddie. So what do you think, Eddie? You think I ought to go through with this marriage? 
EDDIE I don't know about you, Arnold, but if it was me, boy, I'd be in China by now. (back to Charlie) Who have the Yankees got on first? Skowron. Boy, how they touted Skowron. All right, he's having a lucky year. 
CHARLIE Yeah.... 
EDDIE (continuing) ... Well, I mean, is there any argument? Hodges is the best first baseman in both leagues.... 
ARNOLD So, Eddie, what do you think? You think I ought to marry her, go to China, or what? 
EDDIE Arnold, if it bothers you so much, call her up and tell her to forget the whole deal. (back to Charlie) All right Hodges is having a bad year -- but how about last year? He hit over .300. He only hit thirty- five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs---- 
ARNOLD So, Eddie... 
EDDIE Arnold! Get rid of her! You're driving me crazy! 
Arnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps. 
EDDIE (continuing) All right, who's on second? We got Charlie Neal or Gilliam, for that matter, and this isn't even counting Jackie Robinson, head and shoulders, even with a trick knee, the best second baseman in both leagues if they'd let him play there. We got three guys, for Pete's sake, who can outplay anybody the Yankees put on second. 
Arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter. Then walks out of shot. 
EDDIE (continuing) Ever see Charlie Neal go to his right? That Yankee guy, what's his name -- he can't go to his right. And don't forget Neal gets a lot of bases on balls, and once he's on the bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher ... 
The bartender decides to take issue. 
BARTENDER What's Brooklyn going to do for pitching? 
EDDIE Never heard of Newcombe? Never heard of Erskine? 
BARTENDER What have you got to compare with Ford, Kucks, McDermott, Turley--- 
EDDIE McDermott -- McDermott hasn't pitched a full game since last year. 
BARTENDER The best relief pitcher in both leagues. 
EDDIE What's the matter with Eddie Roebuck? 
BARTENDER How do you compare Eddie Roebuck with McDermott? 
EDDIE What are you, a Yankee fan? 
BARTENDER Yeah. 
EDDIE Well, drop dead. (turns angrily back to Charlie) A Yankee fan. 
There is a sudden bellow off. 
ARNOLD'S VOICE Hey! 
Eddie and Charlie slowly turn to look in Arnold's direction. CAMERA PANS to see Arnold from their point of view, a wavering, drunken young man standing in front of the phone booths.

DEAN (CONT'D) Does it hurt? 
CINDY It stings a little. 
Dean tries to pick up Cindy. She struggles against it. Finally he cradles her like a squirming baby. 
CINDY (CONT'D) No, no... Put me down. It's okay... 
Dean huffs a little. Cindy adjusts her weight, self- conscious. He hefts her down the hallway to the bedroom. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Dean awkwardly sets Cindy down on the circular spaceship bed. 
DEAN Wait wait wait. 
He flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning. He runs out of the room. Cindy watches the room around her spin. Dean returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses. He kneels above her and pours them two shots.

DEAN (CONT'D) To numb the pain. Doctors orders. I'm an anesthesiologist. 
CINDY I'm spinning. 
She sits up. They toast. Dean gulps his. Cindy takes a sip. 
DEAN Drink up. We haven't gotten loaded together in years. 
He tops off her glass, refills his own, and quaffs it. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I gotta take a piss. Don't fall asleep. 
He kisses her on the forehead, stumbles. Cindy hears Dean urinating. She is sickened by it. She tries to set her full glass on the floor that spins beneath her. The toilet flushes. The drink tips over. A loud crash comes from the BATHROOM. Cindy sits up. 
CINDY What are you doing in there? ...Dean?! 
An agonizing moan comes from down the hall. Cindy staggers off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Are you all right? Dean... 
She pushes the door but it is blocked. Dean moans louder. Cindy pushes again and inches it open. She sticks her head in, sees him laying on his back looking up at the ceiling. 
DEAN (SLURS) I fell over.

CINDY Ew. Come on, get up. 
DEAN Nope, I want you to come here first. I want you to laugh. 
Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He lets out an "ow" before extending his hand. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Come close. I want to hear you... I want to tell you... Shh, come here... 
Cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor. Their faces are close, eyes locked. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You want to hear a joke? OK. What's better than winning a gold medal at the Special Olympics? 
CINDY What? 
DEAN Not being retarded. 
Cindy looks down. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Hey...that's not funny? How come you don't think I'm funny any more? I tell you something funny. You laugh. I see you laugh. But you don't really laugh so much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy. 
CINDY Dean... Come on, it's time for bed. 
DEAN No I want to make you laugh. 
Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Hello...

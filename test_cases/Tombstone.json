{"test1_input": "MATTIE I hope they're good. \nSTILLWELL (shouting from below) Lady, they better be good. \nDoc enters, Kate on his arm.  The  women exchange uneasy nods. \nDOC Kate, you know the Earps. \nThey sit as White enters with Mayor JOHN CLUM and wife. \nWHITE Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife. \nCLUM Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder - \nWYATT Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you. \nWhile the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, White sits next to Wyatt, pointing out the different Cowboys and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we PAN over them: \nWHITE Well everybody's here except the Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal. Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all Hate Mex, but he hates 'em Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank Stillwell.  That's Behan's little Deputy, Billy Breakenridge. Follows the Cowboys around like a Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's Rimrod; the one looks like an Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best Gun alive they say.  He's kinda Different.  Curly Bill's the only One he talks to.  I mean they're All rough boys, but Ringo... I Don't know.  I really don't \nMusic.  The house lights dim.  The audience hushes.  A spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: \"Professor Gillman and His Ballet of Gravity.\"  Out in the audience, Barnes groans: \nBARNES Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff. \nThe curtain goes up.  PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts tossing Indian clubs in the air.  The audience starts groaning but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes.  Having seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts: \nSTILLWELL Hey profesor!  Catch this! \nStillwell raises his pistol and FIRES.  An Indian club explodes in the Professor's hand.  Screams and scattered laughter in the audience.  The Professor is frozen in utter shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out loud: \nGILLMAN They shot me!  I don't believe it! \nA chord of music and the curtain drops like stone. Applause.... \nEXT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nThe other acotrs hustle the Professor off the stage, appalled. The 1st Actress turns to MR. FABIAN, a handsome, slightly raffish classical tragedian. \n1ST ACTRESS My God, they're shooting at us! They're actually shooting at us! What'll we do? \nFABIAN Only thing we can do, dear-be Good.  In any event, at least we Won't have to wait for our Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now This is theater! \nINT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT \nMore music and another card reads: \"Selections From the Bard of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis.\"  The curtain rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga.  In the audience, Curly Bill's mouth drops: \nCURLY BILL Prettiest man I ever saw \nFabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in doublet and tights.  The whores in the gallery hoot and cheer. Fabian bows. \nSTILLWELL How come he ain't wearin' no pants? \nBARNES (points to whores) That's how come. \nFABIAN Ladies and gentlemen, the St Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V. To set the Scene, England is Now at war with France. Everything rests upon the battle About to begin.  Henry, the young King of England, addresses his men Thusly: \"My cousin Westmorland? No, my fair cousin-\" \nAnother GUNSHOT and a bullet SPANGS into the column next to Fabian with a shower of plaster.  Without missing a beat, Fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues: \nFABIAN \"If we are marked to die, we are enow/ To do our country loss; and if to live./ The fewer me, the greater the share of honour...\" \nIn the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively. \nBARNES He's got nerve, I'll say that. What do you think, Billy? \nStarry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking: \nBREAKENRIDGE Oh, he wonderful! \nGROUNDS Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love. \nRaw laughter from the others.  Breakenridge sinks in his seat. \nCURLY BILL Let him alone. \nOn stage Fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of the ripest ham: \nFABIAN \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;/ For he today that sheds his blood with me/ Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile./ This day shall gentle his Condition;/ And gentlemen in England now a-bed/ Shall think Themselves accurs'd they were no Here./ And hold their manhood Cheap whiles any speaks/ That Fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day!\" \nWild applause and cheering.  Fabian bows with elaborate modesty. \nCURLY BILL That's great!  That's our kinda stuff! \nThe curtain falls.  Another card: \"Faust - or the Devil's Bargain\" and the orchestra whirls into \"Danse Macabre\" by Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley- esque designs and images of death and damnation.  A light comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting alone with his books.  Then a hooded Satan dances across the stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina.  The old man succumbs, signing Satan's contract.  The audience watches in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys: \n", "test1_true": "CURLY BILL Know what I'd do?  I'd take the Deal then crawfish and drill that Ol' Devil in the ass.  How 'bout You, Johnny?  What would you do? \nRINGO I already did it. \nSatan makes a flourish.  A flash-pad EXPLOSION transforms the old scholar into a young student.  The ballerina flits by. The student offers her gold.  They dance, swirling about the stage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, mirroring their every move like a puppet master.  Finally, having gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back into the old scholar sitting with his books.  Satan appears over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord.  Thunderous cheering and applause.  The curtain rises again and the performers come out for bows, all except Satan. \nDOC Very instructive \nWYATT But who was the Devil? \nSuddenly Satan bounds out, removing the hood.  It's Josephine. \nMORGAN It's that woman from the coach! \nWYATT I'll be damned... \nJosephine spots Wyatt's box and smiles.  Doc raises an eyebrow: \nDOC You may indeed.  If you get lucky. \nEXT - ALLEN STREET - NIGHT \nAfter the show and theatergoers, including the Earps, stroll homeward arm-in-arm down Allen, all looking up at the clear night sky above.  At the Oriental Wyatt stops, turning to Virgil: \nWYATT Comin' to the Oriental, Virge? \nALLIE Not tonight! Tonight me and my Old man're gonna have some fun. Get moving, old man! \nShe laughs, shoving Virgil down the street.  He looks at Wyatt: \nVIRGIL Her maiden name was Sullivan. \nWYATT (kisses Mattie) Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you. \nMATTIE (grabs his hand) No, stay.  Please stay with me. \nWYATT Honey, I gotta start makin' money. \nMATTIE Oh, all right. \nWYATT Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while. \nMATTIE No, no, I don't want to keep you. \nWYATT No really, I can stay a while. \nMATTIE Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well. \nWYATT All right, well, good night. \nAnother kiss and he heads for the Oriental with Morgan. Mattie walks on after the others, fishing through her bag for her bottle of laudanum.... \nDELETED \nINT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT \nThe saloon is packed.  TRACK along the bar at floor level past a wild array of high-button shoes, patent leather pumps, and stack-heeled boots with jingling silver spurs.  Track again at shoulder level past an equally wild array of slouch hats, pork-pies, derbys, and wide-brim sombreros.  Wyatt sits against the wall, dealing faro with Doc at his side, Morgan on lookout while a sweaty overdressed HIGH ROLLER makes bets, gnashing his teeth and drumming his fingers n a fever of impatient greed: \nHIGH ROLLER All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go! \nWYATT I'm your man... (deals card) You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire. \nHIGH ROLLER Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go! \nWYATT Awful lot of money. \nHIGH ROLLER Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen. \nWYATT You're the doctor. (deals card) sad news, friend. \nHIGH ROLLER Damn!  All right, wait a minute... \nThe high roller lays a set of deeds out on the table as.... \nINT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT \nA break in the game.  Wyatt studies the deeds as Morgan and Doc look on.  Kate sits to one side, blowing smoke rings contentedly. \nWYATT So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name. \nDOC And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure. \nMORGAN Hey Doc!  Come on now. \n", "test1_id": 2859, "test2_input": "CURLY BILL Anybody else? \nNo takers.  Curly Bill turns back to business: \nCURLY BILL All right.  Billy, go after Ike And cool him off then go find the McLaurys, tell 'em what happened And keep an eye on things.  Wes Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too. Rest of you come with me.  We're Goin' to Mexico. \nThey mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind.... \nEXT - DESERT - DAY \nWyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high hill.  Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops.  Josephine is 100 yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare. \nWYATT Oh, hell... \nLooking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut.  He follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of Josephine.  She waves.  He groans: \nJOSEPHINE Well, hello. \nWYATT We've never actually met.  My Name's- \nJOSEPHINE Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky. \nWYATT I know what it means. \nSuddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, aroused by the presence of the mare. \nJOSEPHINE What is it? \nWYATT Easy now... That mare's in season. \nJOSEPHINE Oh... (calms her horse) Now she's starting.  How do they know? \nWYATT They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up. \nJOSEPHINE I have a better idea, let's run It out of them! \nBefore Wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop.  Wyatt pauses, debating with himself.  Finally: \nWYATT Yeah, I'm an oak all right. \nHe takes off at a dead run.  Catching up, the horses find their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them.  Coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice.  Josephine heads right at it. \nWYATT You're not that crazy, are you? \nJOSPEHINE Oh, yes I am! \nA crack of her crop and she streaks toward it.  Wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit.  The sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like a little girl.  They light on the other side and gallop on.... \nEXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR \nThey pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell.  Wyatt dismounts, helping Josephine.  He takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on. \nJOSEPHINE That was lovely! \nWYATT You know you almost got us both Killed back there? \nJOSEPHINE Fun though, wasn't it? \nWYATT You'd die for fun? \nJOSEPHINE Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed. \nWYATT I laugh sometimes \nJOSEPHINE Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy? \nWYATT Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. \nJOSEPHINE You're a little touchy about it. \nWYATT I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy? \nJOSEPHINE Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife? \nWYATT What about her? \nJOSEPHINE Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? \nWYATT Where do you get these questions? \nJOSEPHINE Just answer. \nWYATT I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know. \n", "test2_true": "WYATT How would you know? \nJOSEPHINE Just doesn't, that's all. \nWYATT Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. (pauses) All right, what's your idea of heaven? \nJOSEPHINE Room service. \nWyatt laughs, almost in spite of himself.  Josephine beams. \nJOSEPHINE See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though. \nWYATT You mean Behan? (sees her shrug) Then why are you with him? \nJOSEPHINE Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring. \nWYATT The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that. \nJOSEPHINE Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest. \nWYATT Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it. \nHe looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds. \nJOSEPHINE What's wrong? \nWYATT I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts. \nJOSEPHINE I know, me too.  What should we do About it? \nHe takes her in his arms and kisses her.  She sinks in his arms.  He kisses her again then falls to her knees, throwing his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds of her skirts. \nWYATT God... \nShe runs a hand through his hair.  He stands, lifting her with him until they are face-to-face and she can feel him pressing into her.  After a beat: \nJOSEPHINE You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that. \nWYATT Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth \nEXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR \nThey loll on the rock, facing each other, clothes in disarray. \nJOSEPHINE I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall. \nWYATT Fortuitous even. \nJOSEPHINE And I don't even know your full name. \nWYATT Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp. \nJOSEPHINE And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie. \nWYATT Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie. \nJOSEPHINE I hate Sadie. \nWYATT Well you'll always be Sadie to me. \nJOSEPHINE Always? \nWYATT Getting late.  We better get back. \nHe looks away and stands, helping her up.  They go to their horses.  He lifts her up into her saddle and stands awhile, arranging the folds of her skirt.  After a beat: \nJOSEPHINE So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude. \nWYATT Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is. \nJOSEPHINE You feel bad about this?  About me? \nWYATT I didn't mean it that way. \nJOSEPHINE You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy. \nWYATT I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me. \nHe mounts and rides off with a wave.  She watches him awhile.... \nINT - FLY'S PHOTOGRAPHIC GALLERY - DAY \nA Victorian photographer's studio behind the O.K. Corral.  A large skylight overhead illuminates the backdrop as CAMMILIUS S.

Finally: \nWYATT Goodbye. \nWyatt opens the coach door for her.  She gets in.  It pulls out with a crack of the driver's whip.  She and Wyatt hold each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance. Then: \nWYATT Damn... Damn! \nCreek Johnson steps up next to him.  Wyatt looks at him: \nWYATT See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason. \nJOHNSON Good God, you're really- \nWYATT Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust. \nEXT - COLD CAMP - NIGHT \nA cold camp in the hollow of a mountain.  Wrapped n blankets, Grounds and Hunt sip cold coffee.  Grounds shivers.  Hunts pats him: \nHUNT No fire tonight, son.  Too many Riders out. \nGrounds grunts.  Suddenly there's an O.S. SOUND.  Both jump up. \nHUNT Who's that? \nBreakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles. \nBREAKENRIDGE It's Deputy Breakenridge. \nThey relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief. \nHUNT Sister Boy!

Breakenridge tenses: \nBREAKENRIDGE Don't try it! \nGROUNDS Sister Boy, just go to hell! \nGrounds raises his pistol.  Breakenridge recoils in fright, stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally FIRES.  Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief on his dying face.  Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling.  Breakenridge FIRES again.  Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and falling to his knees.  He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs timidly: \nBREAKENRIDGE Sorry. \nHunt falls over, dead.

{"train": "TOMBSTONE \nTOMBSTONE \nAn original screenplay By Kevin Jarre \nFourth draft \nMarch 15, 1993 \nROLL PROLOGUE OVER MAIN TITLE:  a collage of old photos, prints, etc., and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream.  The first images show the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their violence.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef.  Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives. In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover'. 'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used.  But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street.  In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun.\" \nA dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest.  Next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols FLASHING around the room like a strobe light: \nV.O. NARRATION \"Straight-up at 75 yards or eye- to-eye at point-blank range, the greatest gunman of all time was an Illinois abolitionist farm boy named James Butler Hickok, better known as Wild Bill, the Prince of Pistoleers.  But Wild Bill worked His trade on the side of justice And as marshal of cowtowns like Hays City and Abilene he became a Legend, the one man who stood Between law and chaos.\" \nNow Hickock sits facing us, playing poker as a shabby-looking FIGURE with a gun steals up behind him and FIRES..... \nV.O. NARRATION \"Wild Bill's fame spread nation- wide but his end came quietly in the spring of '76 when a strange cross-eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his head, apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a celebrity.\" \nNow a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner, raising hell as 2 mustachiod young LAWMEN walk up, trying to quiet them down. \nV.O. NARRATION \"In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson were Becoming known as fast-guns.  But Their fame had nothing to do with Shooting.\" \nSeeing it's hopeless, the lawmen whip out their pistols and start clubbing the drover's making them stagger and grimace, holding their heads.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"Earp and Masterson operated more like modern policemen, using teamwork and persuasion to keep order.  Still, sometimes things got out of hand.\" \nAn ARMED DROVER creeps up behind the lawmen, about to fire.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"But Wyatt had a guardian angel.\" \nA REED-THIN FIGURE with a sawed-off shotgun steps from the shadows behind the drover and FIRES.  The huge blast WHITES- OUT the screen for an instant, making the drover seem to disappear.  The lawmen spin around.  The thin man breaks the shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed. Earp looks at him in shock, mouthing the word \"thanks\". \nV.O. NARRATION \"John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was the son of an aristocratic, highly cultured southern family. Trained in Philadelphia, he had Embarked on a career as a society Dentist when he contracted Tuberculosis.  Advised to practice In the west where it was thought The climate and clean air would Prolong his life, Doc soon Realized it was all only a matter Of time and gave up dentistry to Become a professional gambler and Gunman...\" \nThe scene shifts to an elegant Victorian home: a stern Jewish patriarch orders his darkly beautiful DAUGHTER upstairs as her weeping mother looks on.  The girl huffs up the stairs followed by her little white dog.  Next, the girl and dog are seen escaping through a window to the street below and a waiting cab. \nV.O. NARRATION \"Others headed east.  Bent on becoming an actress.  Josephine Marcus defied her wealthy and Very proper San Francisco Jewish Family to run away with a Traveling theatrical company, Braving the perils of the Frontier on her own.  Dangerous as This might seem, it was another Age and women were so rare, their Presence so cherished that they Could travel virtually anywhere In the west in perfect safety.\" \nNow we see HORSEMEN silhouetted against the night sky, a hand knocking on a door, figures conferring in darkness, then more riders, moving west in restless haste toward the rising sun.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"At about this time the Texas Rangers, having eliminated the Commanche threat, turned their Attention to the outlaw gangs Marauding along the Rio Grande, Cleaning up the border strip in 4 Years of hard riding.  Those they Could not indict or convict the Rangers put down in their Black Book, letting it be known that They could either leave Texas or Face summary execution.  This Resulted in the mass migration of The absolute dregs of the Texas Underworld to the most dangerous, Uncivilized part of the entire Country, the southeast corner of The Arizona Territory.\" \nA jagged, moonlit landscape, a lone prospector and his burro moving along a ridge, a pick digging into a rocky ledge, an ore car emerging from a mine shaft, finally a hilltop cluster of tents becoming the skeletal wood-frame beginnings of a town.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"Harsh and inhospitable, savaged in turn by the Apache and Mexican bandits, this had always been an accursed place, a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself could never prosper, much V.O. NARRATION (cont.) less civilization.  Then in 1879, a prospector named Ed Schiefflin set off alone into the Dragoon Mountains.  Friends told him he Was crazy, that the only thing He'd find in this Godforsaken Place would be his tombstone. Instead he found silver, lots of It, and overnight the town of Tombstone sprang up.  Mining Taking out millions in ore.  Land Value shot sky-high and Speculators and gamblers and Opportunists of all nations Scrambled in by the thousands to Make Tombstone queen of the Boomtowns, so rich that the Latest Paris fashions, hard to Find even in the biggest cities, Were sold there by the wagonload From the makeshift storefronts.\" \nAn engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving north, a newspaper story of a massacre in Mexico, congressmen railing at each other, shaking their fists.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"Meanwhile, the exile Texans had banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang. Seizing controp of the Surrounding countryside they Robbed stagecoaches at will while The big absentee business Interests employed them as tax Collectors and strongarm men.  But The backbone of their trade Remained border rustling, Periodic raids into Mexico to Steal cattle while engaging in What was described as a virtual Orgy of murder and violence.  The Raids became so frequent and so Bloody that the Mexican Government formally protested to U.S. President Chester A. Arthur, Prompting heated debate in Congress.  General Sherman Declared that the only possible Way of bringing order was to send In the army but in the wake of Civil War Reconstruction federal Intervention in civilian affairs Was politically impossible.\" \nPounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night-riding HORSEMEN kicking hell-for-leather across the desert moonscape.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"With only some 100 members, the gang was an elite body of gunmen, known by the red silk sashes they wore around their waists. Fiercely proud of their Terrifying reputation and Answerable to no one, they were a Law unto themselves, finally Emerging as one of the earliest Examples in American history of Full-scale organized crime.\" \nEND MAIN TITLE as the screen fades to an ominous black and.... \nV.O. NARRATION \"They called themselves the Cowboys.\" \nEXT - SONORA DESERT/CANYON ENTRANCE - DAY \nBurning daylight, hard reality.  A squad of uniformed MEXICAN RURALES rides through the Sonora desert, sabres glinting in the sun.  Approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard- bitten CAPTAIN signals them to stop, leaning down to study a jumble of hoofprints on the ground.  He turns to the anxious- looking YOUNG RURALE on his right, speaking in Spanish via subtitle: \nCAPTAIN It's them, only an hour north. \nYOUNG RURALE But this is the border. \nCAPTAIN You saw what those animals did at That rancho.  You think a border Is going to stop me?  No, I'm Going to see them suffer for what They did!  I swear it on my soul! \nThe Captain spurs his horse and they ride on at a gallop, plunging into the canyon.... \nDELETED \nEXT - SKELETON CANYON - NIGHT \nThe full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls of the canyon as the Rurales ride through.  At the bend the Captain halts them.  The young one starts to speak but the Captain shushes him, peering into the darkness.  A few beats then: \nCAPTAIN Turn around!  Fast!  Now! \nBut suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death.  Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale alive.  Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them.  With broad-brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver- studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates. These are the Cowboys:  OLD MAN CLANTON, the ageless, white- bearded leader;  CURLY BILL BROCIUS, 2nd-in-command, smiling, bull-necked;  IKE and BILLY CLANTON, the old man's sons; FLORENTINO, a Mexican half-breed;  and JOHNNY RINGO, dark, Byronic, with an air of something very strange.  The Old Man nods to Florentino: \nDAKE I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience. \nWYATT Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too. \nDake retreats.  Wyatt turns back to his horse testily. Suddenly: \nO.S. VOICE Boy, I'd know that sour face Anywhere. \nWyatt turns.  His brothers stand behind him, smiling.  Though VIRGIL is a little older and heavier.  MORGAN a little younger and slimmer, they're otherwise identical to Wyatt, right down to their style of dress.  Wyatt breaks into a grin, hugging them both, his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm. \nMORGAN Well how do we look? \nWYATT Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you! \nVirgil's blonde wife ALLIE, small, fierce, and Irish, steps up with Morgan's fair, cameo-lovely young LOUISA in tow. \nVIRGIL Wyatt, you remember Allie \nALLIE Good God, well he better. \nWYATT (hugs her, laughing) Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet. (turns to Morgan) Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest. \nVIRGIL But she doted on the frowner \nWyatt's handsome blonde wife MATTIE enters from the street: \nMATTIE Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any- \nWYATT Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer. \nVIRGIL Mrs. Earp?  Land O' love, it finally happened!  Mattie it's a Pleasure! \nAll exchange greetings and hugs.  Wyatt positively beams: \nWYATT Boy, I sure been dreamin' about This.  God!  Since forever!  Wait! \nHe turns them toward the stationhouse window, arranging them in a group and pointing to their reflection. \nWYATT There, look at that!  God Almighty \nWyatt smiles, shaking his head. Morgan's starts to speak, but: \nWYATT Don't talk, just...yeah. \nThey stand silently, studying themselves, together as a family.  Wyatt still shaking his head happily, drinking it in. Finally: \nWYATT All right, now let's go make our fortune. DELETED \nEXT - WAGON - MAGIC HOUR \nA large woman, Wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses the majestic, forbidding Arizona desert with its red volcanic rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so mysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics.... \nEXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT \nA camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with stars.  After dinner.  The women, Virgil, and Morgan sit by the fire.  Morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound. Louisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, turning to Mattie: \nLOUISA Don't you love their hair?  They All have the same hair. \nJust then Wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the moonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur. It's clear he's a magnificent horseman.  Virgil smiles: \nVIRGIL Look at him go, will ya?  I tell You, that's the real Wyatt, born In the saddle. \nMATTIE Oh, he can go all right. \nALLIE Can he then? \nMATTIE Rather ride than eat. \nThe women cackle lasciviously.  Virgil groans at Allie: \nVIRGIL Try to be a lady, will you? \nWyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse. \nMORGAN Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em? \nWYATT Hope so.  Clean up with this boy. \nLouisa turns to Mattie, fishing in her bag: \nLOUISA Mattie hon', did you say you Needed some laudanum?  I have a Bottle right here.  Just be Careful.  It's full of hop. \nMATTIE You're a lifesaver!  Don't worry, I just get headaches sometimes. \nDOC Isn't that a daisy? \nBAILEY Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper. \nDOC Now Ed, are we cross? \nDoc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun-butt under his coat. \nBAILEY Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'. \nDOC Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it. \nNow a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well steals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated .38 Colt Lightning and .45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table. \nDOC There, now we can be friends Again.  But remember, Ed, Friendship is trust-so please Don't hurt me. \nDoc bats his eyelashes.  Bailey jumps up, boiling.  A long, sweaty moment, then Bailey LUNGES.  Doc spring up, grabbing him by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit. Bailey screams and doubles over.  Doc gives him two more blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're having.  But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE that there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand.  The bartender reaches for the shotgun under the bar.  Kate pulls a Derringer from her muff and puts it to his ear. \nKATE Touch that gun, I burn you down! \nHe backs off.  Kate covers the room.  Bailey drops to his knees. \nBAILEY Oh, my God... \nDOC Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good. \nEyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into Bailey's face.  Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position. Kate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking around the room.  Then both back up to the door. \nDOC Well, good evening then. \nThey exit.  The others look down at the groaning Bailey lying in a pool of his own blood.  A GAMBLER shakes his head: \n1ST GAMBLER Judas... \nEXT - STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT \nDoc and Kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the hotel. \nDOC I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling. \nKATE I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started \nKate points to 2 horses saddled and packed outside the hotel. \nDOC My sweet clever Magyar, so that's Why you're not wearing a bustle. \nDoc gives Kate a peck on the cheek as they mount and ride off... \nEXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGES - DAY \nA small cottage at the edge of town.  As the Earps drive up we SEE a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the street while her husband tries to comfort her.  3 small children stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as Cowboys FRANK STILLWELL, cocky, arrogant, and PETE SPENCE, lean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the cottage into the street while snarling things like, \"shut up...deadbeats...move it!\"  The Earps stop, staring at this scene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight.  Virgil restrains her, Stillwell looks up: \nSTILLWELL What're you lookin' at? \nVirgil looks at Wyatt who shakes his head.  They drive on as.... \nEXT - ALLEN STRESS, TOMBSTONE - DAY \nUnlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half- finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond.  We HEAR the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy- gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases.  They pull up in front of the Grand Hotel and step down.  JOHNNY BEHAN, handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands: \nBEHAN Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town? \nWYATT Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers- \nBEHAN Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right? \nWYATT Gave all that up.  Going into business. \nBEHAN Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you... \nEXT - TOMBSTONE OUTSKIRTS/COTTAGE - DAY \nThe Earps and Behan stand on the porch of the very same cottage we saw the Cowboys evict the family from. \nBEHAN The one next door and the one Across the street are vacant too. Same rent and I'll throw in a Good cleaning.  Believe me, you Won't find a better deal within Town limits. \nWyatt looks enquiringly at his brothers.  They shrug.  He's calling the shots.  Wyatt shrugs back.  Finally: \nWYATT Guess we'll take all three. \nEXT - O.K. CORRAL/ALLEN ST. - DAY \nA large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot. Wyatt's big horses feed in their stalls while Wyatt faces the stableboy: \nWYATT I'm getting tired of your gas. Jerk that pistol and go to work. \nTyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone.  Wyatt slaps him again. \nWYATT I said throw down, boy. \nAnother slap.  Tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his chin. \nWYATT You gonna do something or just Stand there and bleed? \nTyler's done.  Wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to Joyce. \nWYATT No, I didn't think so.  Here, Milt.  Keepsake, hang it over the Bar.  All right, youngster.  Out You go... \nWyatt takes Tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room like an unruly child.  At the door he gives the ear a twist. \nWYATT And don't come back.  Ever. \nTyler winces.  Wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns to Joyce casually: \nWYATT See how easy that was? \nEXT - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET (STAGECOACH) - DAY \nLater.  Wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner. \nWYATT Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental. \nVIRGIL Acquired? \nWYATT So to speak. \nDown the block, unseen by the Earps, a wild-eyed Tyler is advancing on them with a sawed-off shotgun.  He is within 20 feet when suddenly: \nO.S. VOICE Why Johnny Tyler, you madcap, Where are you going with that Shotgun? \nTyler spins around to see Doc standing in a doorway, smiling. Tyler freezes. \nTYLER Doc.  I didn't know you were in town. \nWyatt spots Doc and walks up, brothers in tow.  Though they don't so much as shake hands, we sense a strong bond between the 2 men. \nWYATT Doc!  How the hell are you? \nDOC Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect. \nTYLER Wyatt?  Wyatt Earp? \nMORGAN Going into business for Ourselves.  Wyatt just got us a Faro game. \nDOC Since when is faro a business? \nWYATT Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade? \nDOC I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house. \nWYATT Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads. \nDOC That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything. \nThey laugh.  Frozen there.  Tyler begins to tremble.  Finally: \nDOC Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all About you.  You can go now.  Just Leave the shotgun. \nTYLER Thank you. \nTyler scuttles off as Behan approaches affably.  Doc sniffs. \nWYATT Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday. \nDOC Forgive me if I don't shake hands. \nBEHAN So how's Tombstone treating you? \nWYATT Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track. \nBEHAN Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up. \nDOC Little ahead of yourselves, Aren't you?  This is just a mining Camp. \nBEHAN See how everyone dresses?  Awfully Toney for a mining camp.  No, the Die's cast, we're growing, be as Big as San Francisco in a few Years.  And just as sophisticated. \nDOC I can hardly wait. \nMATTIE I hope they're good. \nSTILLWELL (shouting from below) Lady, they better be good. \nDoc enters, Kate on his arm.  The  women exchange uneasy nods. \nDOC Kate, you know the Earps. \nThey sit as White enters with Mayor JOHN CLUM and wife. \nWHITE Wyatt, this is Mayor Clum and his wife. \nCLUM Your reputation precedes you.  I wonder - \nWYATT Not a prayer.  Nice meetin' you. \nWhile the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, White sits next to Wyatt, pointing out the different Cowboys and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we PAN over them: \nWHITE Well everybody's here except the Old Man.  Got the blade, Billy Grounds, Zwing Hunt, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, Tom and Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton's The youngest.  Wild one.  Then the Breeds, Hank Swilling, Pony Deal. Florentino's Mex-breed.  They all Hate Mex, but he hates 'em Special.  Johnny Barnes, Frank Stillwell.  That's Behan's little Deputy, Billy Breakenridge. Follows the Cowboys around like a Puppy.  And the big boys: Curly Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's Rimrod; the one looks like an Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best Gun alive they say.  He's kinda Different.  Curly Bill's the only One he talks to.  I mean they're All rough boys, but Ringo... I Don't know.  I really don't \nMusic.  The house lights dim.  The audience hushes.  A spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: \"Professor Gillman and His Ballet of Gravity.\"  Out in the audience, Barnes groans: \nBARNES Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff. \nThe curtain goes up.  PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts tossing Indian clubs in the air.  The audience starts groaning but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes.  Having seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts: \nSTILLWELL Hey profesor!  Catch this! \nStillwell raises his pistol and FIRES.  An Indian club explodes in the Professor's hand.  Screams and scattered laughter in the audience.  The Professor is frozen in utter shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out loud: \nGILLMAN They shot me!  I don't believe it! \nA chord of music and the curtain drops like stone. Applause.... \nEXT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nThe other acotrs hustle the Professor off the stage, appalled. The 1st Actress turns to MR. FABIAN, a handsome, slightly raffish classical tragedian. \n1ST ACTRESS My God, they're shooting at us! They're actually shooting at us! What'll we do? \nFABIAN Only thing we can do, dear-be Good.  In any event, at least we Won't have to wait for our Notices.  Exciting, isn't it?  Now This is theater! \nINT - SHIEFFELIN HALL - NIGHT \nMore music and another card reads: \"Selections From the Bard of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis.\"  The curtain rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga.  In the audience, Curly Bill's mouth drops: \nCURLY BILL Prettiest man I ever saw \nFabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in doublet and tights.  The whores in the gallery hoot and cheer. Fabian bows. \nSTILLWELL How come he ain't wearin' no pants? \nBARNES (points to whores) That's how come. \nFABIAN Ladies and gentlemen, the St Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V. To set the Scene, England is Now at war with France. Everything rests upon the battle About to begin.  Henry, the young King of England, addresses his men Thusly: \"My cousin Westmorland? No, my fair cousin-\" \nAnother GUNSHOT and a bullet SPANGS into the column next to Fabian with a shower of plaster.  Without missing a beat, Fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues: \nFABIAN \"If we are marked to die, we are enow/ To do our country loss; and if to live./ The fewer me, the greater the share of honour...\" \nIn the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively. \nBARNES He's got nerve, I'll say that. What do you think, Billy? \nStarry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking: \nBREAKENRIDGE Oh, he wonderful! \nGROUNDS Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love. \nRaw laughter from the others.  Breakenridge sinks in his seat. \nCURLY BILL Let him alone. \nOn stage Fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of the ripest ham: \nFABIAN \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;/ For he today that sheds his blood with me/ Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile./ This day shall gentle his Condition;/ And gentlemen in England now a-bed/ Shall think Themselves accurs'd they were no Here./ And hold their manhood Cheap whiles any speaks/ That Fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day!\" \nWild applause and cheering.  Fabian bows with elaborate modesty. \nCURLY BILL That's great!  That's our kinda stuff! \nThe curtain falls.  Another card: \"Faust - or the Devil's Bargain\" and the orchestra whirls into \"Danse Macabre\" by Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley- esque designs and images of death and damnation.  A light comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting alone with his books.  Then a hooded Satan dances across the stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina.  The old man succumbs, signing Satan's contract.  The audience watches in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys: \nWYATT Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything. \nDOC So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others? \nWYATT Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up. \nDOC I see.  And what would you do if \"she\" walked in her right now? WYATT \"She\"? \nDOC You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan. \nWYATT I don't know.  Probably ignore her. \nDOC Ignore her? \nWYATT I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc. \nDOC I'll remember you said that. \nDoc point.  Josephine has just walked in with the other actors. \nWYATT Oh, hell... \nShe spots Wyatt and starts toward him but he looks away, as if ignoring her.  She stops.  Behan steps up to her, tipping his hat, very gallant.  They move toward the bar.  Wyatt turns to Doc. \nWYATT Satisfied? \nDOC I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak. \nJosephine and Behan chat at the bar.  White nudges Joyce: \nWHITE Since when'd you start servin' Ladies in here? \nJOYCE Actresses.  It's different. \nMr Fabian enters, dramatically gotten-up like Lord Byron.  The whole bar bursts into applause.  He bows.  Breakenridge jumps up from his table, excited: \nBREAKENRIDGE Here, Mr Fabian, have this table. \nHe seats Fabian near the faro game, gets him some champagne. \nFABIAN Oh, thank you.  You're very kind. \nBREAKENRIDGE Mr. Fabian, I've got to tell you, That's the most wonderful thing I Ever saw.  What was that? \nFABIAN Henry's all right but he's no Match for the Melancholy Dane. (sees his confusion) Hamlet, dear friend, the supreme Role of any actor worth his salt. \nDOC (leans in, points to Wyatt) Here's a man you should meet, Mr. Fabian.  Excellent character study For you, the real-life actual Melancholy Dane. \nFABIAN Indeed, sir?  How so? \nDOC Well he hems, he haws, he talks Out of both sides of his Mouth-but all on a very high Plane, just like Hamlet. \nWYATT Getting drunk, Doc. \nDoc chuckles.  Suddenly Curly Bill looms over the faro table with Ringo and a drunken Ike Clanton. \nCURLY BILL Wyatt Earp, huh?  I heard of you. \nIKE Listen, Mr. Kansas Law-dog.  Law Don't go around her.  Savvy? \nWYATT I'm retired. \nCURLY BILL Good.  That's real good. \nIKE Yeah, that's good, Mr. Law-dog, 'cause law don't go around here. \nWYATT I heard you the first time. \nCURLY BILL Shut up, Ike. \nRINGO (steps up to Doc) And you must be Doc Holliday. \nDOC That's the rumor. \nRINGO You retired, too? \nDOC Not me.  I'm in my prime. \nRINGO Yeah, you look it. \nDOC And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him? \nKATE You don't even know him. \nBEHAN Have you been out in the street? Somebody's got to do something. \nCLUM You're the Sheriff. \nBEHAN It's not County business, it's a Town matter. \nOutside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover. Curly Bill cackles.  Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt: \nWYATT Why don't you just leave it alone? \nWHITE No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card- \nWYATT None of my business, Fred. \nWyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing.  White draws himself up and exits.  Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting. White steps out into the street.  We feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is trembling.  He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly Bill: \nWHITE Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy... \nCurly Bill spins around.  White's gun stares him in the face. \nCURLY BILL Well, howdy, Fred! \nBack in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc. \nWYATT Maybe I ought to go out there. \nDOC You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep. \nDoc lays his head down on the keys, passes out.  Wyatt frowns for a moment.  Finally he stands, turning to Morgan: \nWYATT Go wake up Virgil. (turns to Joyce) Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you? \nJoyce hands him a Colt from under the bar.  Outside White covers Curly Bill, trembling harder now.  An adrenaline rush in a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so vulnerable.  Even his voice has a quavering edge to it: \nWHITE Hand that over.  Come on now. \nCURLY BILL Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun. Here she is. \nWith a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt- first.  White reaches for it, visibly relieved.  But quick as a snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and FIRES POINT BLANK into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast so close it sets his clothes on fire.   Curly Bill turns just as Wyatt flashes into frame and SLAMS him over the head with his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap.  Wyatt glances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest.  Clum runs up: \nWYATT Put his clothes out. \nClum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt starts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself surrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys. \nIKE Turn loose of him. \nWYATT He just killed a man. \nBILLY He said to turn loose of him. \nWYATT Well I'm not so go home. \nIKE Swear to God, Mister, step aside Or we'll tear you apart. \nThe Cowboys tense up, ready for action.  Wyatt holds his ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike: \nWYATT You.  Come here a second. \nIke steps up, full of brass.  Without warning Wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head back.  Wyatt cocks the pistol.  The other Cowboys hush.  Ike freezes.  Wyatt's eyes bore into him. \nWYATT You die first, get it?  The others Might get me in a rush but before That I'm gonna make your head Into a canoe.  Understand? \nIke stands stock still.  Billy steps forward, undaunted: \nBILLY He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him! \nThis is it.  The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, but: \nO.S. VOICE And you, you simpleton, you're next. \nAgain a hush.  Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with his .38 trained on Billy.  Billy sneers: \nBILLY Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's So drunk he's probably seein' Double. \nDoc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on Billy: \nDOC I have two guns.  One for each of you. \nBilly pauses, chastened.  Suddenly there's another commotion as Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from behind with shotguns. \nVIRGIL All right, look out!  Break it up. Go home, all of you, go home now... \nThis breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the Cowboys disperse.  Wyatt lowers his pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy Curly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail. \nWYATT Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this. (turns to Morgan) Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him. (no answer, pauses) Oh no, don't tell me... \nMorgan looks down in sheepish silence.  Then he pulls back his coat, revealing the Deputy's badge on this vest.  Wyatt groans. \nMORGAN Like you said, Wyatt.  We're Brothers.  Gotta back your Brother's play.  Just did like I Figured you would. \nWYATT Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White. \nMORGAN Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all. \nWYATT Yeah? \nMORGAN Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt. \nWYATT All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else. (turns to Morgan) It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg. \nMORGAN What're you talkin' about? \nWyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby brother, looking deep in his eyes, his voice soft, plaintive: \nWYATT All the years I worked the Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job.  I don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but... I don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain.  At First I just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside.  But When it finally sunk in what I'd Done... Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way. Not ever. (pauses) Didn't even make a dent, did I? (stands, exits) You're both makin' a big mistake. \nEXT - DESERT, HOOKER RANCH - DAY \nArmed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes scanning the tracks beneath him.  He rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house.  He dismounts, studying tracks as rancher HENRY HOOKER rides up, strong, noble-looking, like something from a Frederic Remington canvas.  Wyatt nods. Hooker nods back. \nWYATT This Hooker's ranch? \nHOOKER That's right.  And I'm Hooker. \nWYATT You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion? \nHooker suddenly falls silent, looking at the ground nervously. \nWYATT Well you must've seen somethin', The trail runs right by your Waterhole. (no answer) Oh, I see.  So it must've been a Cowboy, right?  Really got you People treed, don't they? \nHOOKER Look, Mister, it's fine for you Boomers to court trouble, you're Just passin' through.  Us Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I Can do's point you up to the cut. That's their roost. \nWyatt nods his thanks.  Hooker looks down, ashamed.  Wyatt stares at him a moment.  There's something genuinely troubling about so strong a man living in fear.  Wyatt rides on, shaking his head.... \nINT - DESERT CAMP - DAY \nA small camp near a clump of trees.  Pony Deal brews coffee while McMasters leans against a fallen oak log feeding an eager pack of mongrel pups from a block of jerky as Wyatt rides up. \nMCMASTERS Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas! \nWYATT McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with- \nMCMASTERS Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither. \nWYATT I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back \nMCMASTERS Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen? \nEXT - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nWyatt and McMasters ride along side-by-side through the hills. \nWYATT So what about you Cowboys anyway? \nMCMASTERS If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone. \nWYATT Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done... \nMCMASTERS There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher. \nEXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DAY \nA wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents, water and fee troughs, rope corrals, etc.  Cowboys cut out steers while others crouch around fires, cooking, looking up with naked hostility as Wyatt rides up.  McMasters points to the edge of camp where Billy Clanton is currying Wyatt's stallion. \nMCMASTERS You seem like a nice fella.  Like To've know you better.  Had you lived. \nWyatt rides on, making for Billy.  Ike steps up with INDIAN HAWK SWILLING, the giant half-breed.  They walk alongside Wyatt. \nIKE Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here? \nSWILLING How 'bout I just drag you off That horse and eat you blood raw? \nWyatt ignores them, riding up to within 20 feet of Billy and dismounting.  Billy looks up, supremely confident and unconcerned. \nWYATT Where'd you get that horse? \nBILLY Beauty, ain't he? \nCURLY BILL Anybody else? \nNo takers.  Curly Bill turns back to business: \nCURLY BILL All right.  Billy, go after Ike And cool him off then go find the McLaurys, tell 'em what happened And keep an eye on things.  Wes Fuller and Bill Claiborne, too. Rest of you come with me.  We're Goin' to Mexico. \nThey mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind.... \nEXT - DESERT - DAY \nWyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high hill.  Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops.  Josephine is 100 yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare. \nWYATT Oh, hell... \nLooking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut.  He follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of Josephine.  She waves.  He groans: \nJOSEPHINE Well, hello. \nWYATT We've never actually met.  My Name's- \nJOSEPHINE Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky. \nWYATT I know what it means. \nSuddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, aroused by the presence of the mare. \nJOSEPHINE What is it? \nWYATT Easy now... That mare's in season. \nJOSEPHINE Oh... (calms her horse) Now she's starting.  How do they know? \nWYATT They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up. \nJOSEPHINE I have a better idea, let's run It out of them! \nBefore Wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop.  Wyatt pauses, debating with himself.  Finally: \nWYATT Yeah, I'm an oak all right. \nHe takes off at a dead run.  Catching up, the horses find their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them.  Coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice.  Josephine heads right at it. \nWYATT You're not that crazy, are you? \nJOSPEHINE Oh, yes I am! \nA crack of her crop and she streaks toward it.  Wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit.  The sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like a little girl.  They light on the other side and gallop on.... \nEXT - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR \nThey pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell.  Wyatt dismounts, helping Josephine.  He takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on. \nJOSEPHINE That was lovely! \nWYATT You know you almost got us both Killed back there? \nJOSEPHINE Fun though, wasn't it? \nWYATT You'd die for fun? \nJOSEPHINE Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed. \nWYATT I laugh sometimes \nJOSEPHINE Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy? \nWYATT Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. \nJOSEPHINE You're a little touchy about it. \nWYATT I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy? \nJOSEPHINE Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife? \nWYATT What about her? \nJOSEPHINE Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? \nWYATT Where do you get these questions? \nJOSEPHINE Just answer. \nWYATT I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know. \nFLY What mood would you like for this Picture, Miss Marcus?  Any Particular occasion you're Commemorating? \nJOSEPHINE O.S. I want to remember exactly how I Looked on this day so I want you To take a picture of me... \nShe steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from head to toe.  Though it partially obscures her form, we can see that she's completely nude underneath.  Fly gasps. \nJOSEPHINE ...all of me. \nFly fumbles with his camera, his composure gone.  She turns to a nearby mirror, studying herself-black tresses, rounded lips, maddening curves, and smokey eyes-a dark angel.  She smiles: \nJOSEPHINE Because I'm wonderful. \nINT - WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMattie lies in bed, lost in an opium dream.  She snaps out of it and sits up as Wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing at the half-empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand. \nWYATT That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff. \nMATTIE I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been? \nWYATT Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'? \nMATTIE I don't know.  I'm all right. \nWYATT Really?  You sure? \nMATTIE Sure I'm sure.  What is this? \nWyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight: \nWYATT Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be? \nMATTIE Wyatt, what're you talkin' about? \nWYATT Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it. \nINT - ORIENTAL - NIGHT \nDark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, Doc is at the corner table with Virgil, Behan, Ike Clanton, and the McLaurys.  Josephine lounges by the piano, luscious in a white gown, singing \"Frankie and Johnny\" in a torchy voice.  Wyatt enters, blanching at the sight of Josephine.  Joyce appears at his elbow: \nJOYCE New singer.  Ain't she somehin'? \nWyatt nods weakly.  Josephine gives him a half-smile.  Wyatt blushes.  Morgan approaches. \nMORGAN Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go. \nWYATT I know.  And nobody can make him. \nThey go over to Doc's table and sit down.  Doc beams drunkenly: \nDOC Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair. \nWYATT Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc. \nDOC Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself. \nWYATT (touches his shoulder) But Doc- \nDOC I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much \nWYATT Sorry, sorry... \nKATE (puts arm around Doc) That's right.  Doc can go all day And all night and then some. Doc's my man.  Doc's my lovin' Man.  Have another one, lovin' man. \nShe kisses Doc.  Behan nudges Wyatt: \nBEHAN What d'you think of the singer? \nWYATT Nice voice. \nBEHAN That's not what I meant. \nBehan gives him a wink.  Wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat. This hand is down to Doc and Ike and the pot is huge.  Doc shows his hand.  Ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage: \nIKE Son of a bitch!  That's twelve Straight hands!  Nobody's that lucky. \nThe Earps stiffen as the Cheshire cat smile comes over Doc: \nDOC Why, Ike, whatever do you mean? \nVIRGIL Come on, boys, take it easy. \nDOC Maybe poker's not your game, Ike. I know, let's have a spelling Contest! \nAt the last possible instant, Curly Bill flashes into frame along with Stillwell and Spence, grabbing Ringo from behind while the Earps step in front of Doc. \nCURLY BILL Johnny, don't, Jesus!  Come on, Son... (turns to Earps) Never mind.  He's drunk. \nThey haul Ringo up the street, out of earshot.  Ringo is boiling: \nRINGO I want them spitting blood! \nCURLY BILL Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time. (turns to others) I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy! \nHe pulls Ringo into a doorway, away from the others.  Tears in his eyes, clawing the air, Ringo is beside himself. \nRINGO There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die! \nCURLY BILL Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground. \nINT - ADOBE HOUSE - NIGHT \nAn adobe rancho in the Sonora desert, small, humbly furnished. Inside a Mexican family, 3 children, a husband and young wife eat dinner.  Suddenly Curly Bill and Ringo BURST IN, guns drawn, shouting in Spanish.  Everyone freezes and as the children start crying we feel the family's sense of inner terror.  Curly Bill looks the trembling young wife over, nodding at Ringo: \nCURLY BILL See son, there is a God after all! \nEXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - DUSK \nNightfall and the wind HOWLS down the street, kicking up dust in swirling columns.  A FLASH of lightning streaks down from the purple clouds and a THUNDERCLAP crashes in our ears, echoing through town into the hills, making the horses neigh and fidget... \nINT- ORIENTAL - DUSK \nBut inside it's bright and warm.  Florentino is alone at the bar, nursing a drink while Wyatt deals for Morgan and a few others.  Virgil looks out at the storm, shaking his head: \nVIRGIL Gonna be one of those nights. \nEXT- RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK \nThe Cowboys are gathered on a rise.  Curly Bill stands before them, silhouetted against the boiling sky, arms outstretched, exulting in the storm's fury.   He turns to his men, eyes ablaze: \nCURLY BILL All right, boys.  Now's the time To get woolly. \nINT - JOSEPHINE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJosephine sits by the window, reading Swinburne.  A KNOCK at the door.  She answers it.  Behan enters.  She bristles, but: \nBEHAN Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em. \nJOSEPHINE I don't understand. \nBEHAN You will after tonight.  Bet on it. \nINT - PARLOR, VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAllie and Louisa sip tea by a blazing fire in the hearth, warming themselves against the storm's cold.  Mattie sits nearby, sewing. \nALLIE God, it's a cold night.  Come up To the fire, Mattie. \nSuddenly there's a KNOCK at the door.  Louisa looks out the window.  Outside is the tall silhouette of a WOMAN in a dark cloak. \nLOUISA It looks like a woman. \nAllie opens the door.  Josephine enter, breathless, comes into the parlor.  Mattie sits up in shock.  The others gather round. \nJOSEPHINE Please, I know it's awful me Coming here, but listen, I can't Say why, but I think something is- \nAnother KNOCK.  Allie goes to the window.  There's a weird sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as outside we again see a cloaked woman's SILHOUETTE. \nALLIE Now who in... It's another woman. \nAllie starts to open the door but Josephine suddenly leaps up and: \nJOSEPHINE No!  Look out! \nWith her dancer's quickness she dashes across the parlor, grabbing Allie and pulling her to the floor just as a tremendous SHOTGUN BLAST rips through the open doorway.  The chandelier overhead explodes, showering the screaming women with broken glass and a harsh MALE VOICE cuts through the air as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness: \nMAN'S VOICE Everybody dies! \nINT- ORIENTAL - NIGHT \nThe sound of the gunshots are lost in the wind and thunder as Virgil gets up, yawning: \nVIRGIL Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in. \nWYATT Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there. \nVirgil nods, exiting with a wave.  Wyatt and Morgan keep playing, hardly noticing as moments later, Florentino walks out.... \nMorgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge.  Wyatt drops into a corner chair, defeated.  Morgan makes a shot, leaving only the 8 ball.  A few beats.  Seeing Wyatt's misery, Morgan softens, poking him with the cue.  Wyatt looks up. Morgan taps the middle pocket.  Wyatt shakes his head. \nMORGAN How much you wanna bet? \nWyatt holds up his watch.  Morgan frowns.  Wyatt raises his brows: \nWYATT I just got it fixed. \nMORGAN You're on. \nMorgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, looking over at Wyatt in triumph.  Wyatt applauds, rolling his eyes just as a BULLET SPANGS into the wall by his head.  Wyatt dives for the floor as ANOTHER SHOT pierces the window.  Wyatt jumps up, bounding to the door to see several FIGURES cash into the darkness.  Wyatt turns back and freezed.  Morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking and shuddering involuntarily.  Wyatt rushes to him.  The dog whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters.  Wyatt is trembling. \nWYATT No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ! \nINTO - ORIENTAL - NIGHT \nThe curious crowd outside, watching through the windows. Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt pulled up.  The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making Morgan writhe in perfect agony.  The doctor turns to Wyatt: \nDR. GOODFELLOW Hold him. \nWyatt takes Morgan in his arms.  The doctor probes.  Morgan jerks violently.  Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM. Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter hysterics. \nWYATT Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus! \nAnd now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip.  The doctor snarls, about at the end of his rope. \nDR. GOODFELLOW I said hold him, God damn it! \nWYATT Somebody shut that dog up! \nMorgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's. \nMORGAN You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too. \nWYATT Will somebody get the damn dog out- \nMORGAN Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'? \nWYATT Easy Morg, don't think about that now. \nMORGAN Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing. \nTears well up in Wyatt's eyes.  He touches his brother's face. Morgan's eyelids start fluttering.  Wyatt squeezes his hand. \nWYATT Morgan?  Morgan! \nThe dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the next moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the mourning.  Wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at the blood on his hands.  Standing in the crowd across the street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him.  Behan grabs her.  She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, starts running toward Wyatt.  Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head: \nWYATT No, no, get away, get away from me... \nJOSEPHINE Wyatt... \nShe keeps coming.  Wyatt panics.  Finally, in desperation: \nWYATT Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away From me! \nShe pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying. Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt.  Doc pulls her back: \nDOC Can't you see why he did it? \nThe howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone. Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, staring at his bloody hands.... \nEXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY \nThe wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, hitched and ready.  Virgil is up front with the women, arm in a sling, pale.  Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby.  Finished loading, Wyatt looks around.  People line the street, watching in silence.  Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze. The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active. Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat, her little white dog scampering after her.  Passing Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits.  She doesn't even break stride.  Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring look. \nCURLY BILL Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her. \nPassing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him.  Doc sighs: \nDOC And so she walked out of our Lives forever. \nWithout a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off.  He pulls up in front of the Cowboys. They make a show of pretending to hide their guns.  Wyatt looks straight ahead: \nWYATT I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back. \nCURLY BILL Well... 'bye. \nRINGO (sniffs) Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died. \nCURLY BILL (stifling a laugh) Oh, Jesus, Johnny... \nAllie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob.  The Cowboys snicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight ahead, and drives on.  A few beats then Curly Bill turns to Ike: \nLUCINDA Your colors. \nWyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up: \nWAGONMASTER Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell! \nThey shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men.  They take off at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall and the desert beyond.  Unable to contain himself any longer, Lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast: \nLUCINDA'S SON Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man, Whistling death and bloody Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder In his heart!  Wyatt and his he- Devils, holy terrors and true, Five black centaurs blowin' fire And quicksilver!  Ride out and Charge and shoot and strike and Cleave and hack and thrust home! Don't let up and give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One's smashed and smote and Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all And break 'em up and bang their Heads together in a bunch and Give no quarter though they be Ten times ten thousand! \nWyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a cavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a single bound and pass into the desert.  An immigrant FATHER grabs his infant son, lifting him up. \nILLINOIS MOTHER What're you doing? \nILLINOIS FATHER Someday he'll be able to say he Was there when Wyatt Earp rode Out to bring the law. \nMusic up, avenging and bright, as Wyatt and his men ride through the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy black coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in unison. \nWYATT All right, let's wring 'em out! \nThey break into a dead run, streaking across the frame.  As they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth. Johnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of being alive: \nJOHNSON Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'. \nEXT - RUSTLERS PARK - LATE DAY \nThe sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge overlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several Cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on bedrolls, laughing and drinking.  On the other side, at the foot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over a fire, cooking.  Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating.  Spence turns to Pony Deal who shrugs: \nPONY DEAL Maybe they smell a wolf. \nSPENCE (turns to other Cowboy) Go up there and take a look. \nThe Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far side of the ridge.  Spence and the others continue cooking. Moments later a CRASHING SOUND comes echoing over the ridge like thunder.  The Cowboys look up, startled.  Pony Deal points: \nPONY DEAL Look! \nThe pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge.  The Cowboys exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far end of the ridge.  Then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the speed of a flame.  They are within a few yards of the fire when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and: \nBARNES Look out! \nSpence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before Wyatt and his horsemen SLAM into them with terrifying impact, the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves.  The Cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols BLAZING in air, horses rearing and snorting. \nWYATT United States Marshals!  Reach! \nEveryone freezes.  A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back behind the others, trying not to be spotted.  Meanwhile Doc leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's forehead. \nDOC Say something witty. \nThey herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, \"Get over there!\",  \"Move it!\", etc.  But Barnes brazens up to Wyatt: \nBARNES Hey, you can't come- \nA loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone. \nWYATT One more word and I'll blind you. Get over there! \nPONY DEAL (to McMasters) Hey brother, what're you doin'- \nMCMASTERS I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move! \nWYATT All right, run 'em off. \nDoc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their herd with pistol shots.  Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt: \nSWILLING Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like To eat you blood raw! \nA queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling. \nWYATT All right, breed.  Dig in. \nAnd then Wyatt DRILLS him in the jaw with a straight right hand.  Swilling drops like a stone.  Wyatt hauls him up by the hair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, and pile-drives a left hook to his gut.  Swilling topples back into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes out.  Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and makes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling. \nDOC It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut. \nWYATT (faces Cowboys) Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours. \nAt the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off bareback.  McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its scabbard: \nMCMASTERS Florentino!  He's getting away! \nWYATT Drop his horse. \nMcMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 Winchester and FIRES.  100 yards away, the bullet hits Florentino's horse in the shoulder with a \"thunk\".  It drops, tumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into the ground.  He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts running.  Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, closing the distance in seconds.  Florentino gasps and runs faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top of him.  He turns and FIRES on the run.  A branch next to Wyatt's head EXPLODES.  Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his Buntline, impervious, unstoppable.  Florentino turns for another shot just as the black PILES into him, sending him flying and tumbling him down an embankment.  He scrambles to his feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with deliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in front of him.  Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, shaking his head: \nCURLY BILL Easy now, it's only five men. Been havin' it their way 'cause They been surprising you.  Hittin' The waterholes and that Judas McMasters is showin' 'em right Where they are.  Pretty damn cute. But nobody's cute as me. (points to dirt map) Next up's Black Draw.  But that Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's Where they'll expect us to hit, We'll hit the one after.  Iron Springs.  That's where they show Next.  Only I'm gonna be there First.  And throw a little party. \nCurly Bill grins, his coarse face radiant in the firelight... \nEXT - WYATT'S CAMP - NIGHT \nDoc sits by the fire, shaking and shivering and sweating. Vermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket, but: \nDOC Don't touch me! \nVERMILLION Sorry... \nHe pulls back.  Doc wraps himself in the blanket.  After a beat: \nVERMILLION You really look awful. \nDOC Not half as bad as I feel. \nVERMILLION Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed. \nDOC Wyatt Earp is my friend. \nVERMILLION Hell, I got lot's of friends. \nDOC (turns, glares at him) I don't. \nMeanwhile at the other side of the camp, Wyatt and McMasters huddle over the map, Johnson walks up: \nJOHNSON Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it. \nWYATT There's no reasoning with him. \nMCMASTERS (points to map) Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning. \nWYATT They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs. \nEXT - IRON SPRINGS - DAWN \nA camp near a waterhole with 2 Cowboys crouched by a fire, sipping coffee.  Wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking it and dismount, unseen. \nMCMASTERS There they are.  No herd though. \nWYATT We'll go around that way, come up on foot. \nThey pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected. But suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and: \nMCMASTERS Ambush!  Get down! \nAnd suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side EXPLODES IN GUNFIRE.  Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, hugging the rocks.  A bullet RICHOCHETS into a rock at Johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him wince: \nJOHNSON Christ! \nHunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting: \nCURLY BILL Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you? \nWyatt and his men react to his voice.  The fire continues. Suddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them.  Doc points: \nDOC Look! \nCURLY BILL Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you.  Another Minute or two, gonna have you in A crossfire!  How do you like that? \nSeeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent Wyatt: \nMCMASTERS He's right.  They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us. \nAnd now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual naked fear.  But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his life. \nCURLY BILL 'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks! \nCrouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles.  A confident ripple of laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got them.  On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly. \nVERMILLION Ain't takin' me alive, damn it! \nMcMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging helplessly: \nMCMASTERS Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked. \nThey really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt for a solution.  He remains silent.  Then suddenly, in this supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply: \nWYATT No. \nJOHNSON What? \nSeeing each other, Wyatt and Josephine freeze.  Wyatt approaches: \nWYATT Sorry about your friend. (pauses) And I'm sorry about... \nJOSEPHINE I forgave you the moment you said it. \nWYATT You did.  Well... thank you. \nThe driver jumps back onto the stage, motioning to the others. \nJOSEPHINE I have to go. \nWYATT Wait! \nShe stops.  Wyatt falters.  There's so much he wants to say, but... Finally: \nWYATT Goodbye. \nWyatt opens the coach door for her.  She gets in.  It pulls out with a crack of the driver's whip.  She and Wyatt hold each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance. Then: \nWYATT Damn... Damn! \nCreek Johnson steps up next to him.  Wyatt looks at him: \nWYATT See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason. \nJOHNSON Good God, you're really- \nWYATT Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust. \nEXT - COLD CAMP - NIGHT \nA cold camp in the hollow of a mountain.  Wrapped n blankets, Grounds and Hunt sip cold coffee.  Grounds shivers.  Hunts pats him: \nHUNT No fire tonight, son.  Too many Riders out. \nGrounds grunts.  Suddenly there's an O.S. SOUND.  Both jump up. \nHUNT Who's that? \nBreakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles. \nBREAKENRIDGE It's Deputy Breakenridge. \nThey relax and lower their pistols, heaving sighs of relief. \nHUNT Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid- \nBREAKENRIDGE You shouldn't've killed Mr. Fabian.  You shouldn't've done That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin' You both in for it. \nHUNT What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look, Just go home 'fore you get hurt. \nBREAKENRIDGE Don't want to kill you but I will If I have to.  I'm warning you. \nGROUNDS No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy! \nGrounds steps forward menancingly.  Breakenridge tenses: \nBREAKENRIDGE Don't try it! \nGROUNDS Sister Boy, just go to hell! \nGrounds raises his pistol.  Breakenridge recoils in fright, stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally FIRES.  Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief on his dying face.  Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling.  Breakenridge FIRES again.  Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and falling to his knees.  He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs timidly: \nBREAKENRIDGE Sorry. \nHunt falls over, dead.  Breakenridge stares at the bodies, hardly believing it himself.... \nEXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER'S RANCH - MORNING \nWyatt and his men are on the porch, listening to Hooker: \nHOOKER ...brought 'em in draped over their saddles.  Little Billy Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done It.  So I guess the law's finally Arrived in southeast Arizona. \nWyatt shakes his head, hardly comprehending what he started.... \nEXT - COWBOY CAMP #3 - DAY \nThe Cowboys are camped on a mountaintop overlooking Hooker's ranch in the valley below.  A messenger rides up with a letter for Behan as Ringo paces, studying the set up with Ike. \nRINGO Hooker's got around 15 or 16 Hands.  We could take 'em right Enough but it might be a mess. Keep the place bottled up for Now, see if we can figure a way To flush 'em. \nBehan suddenly steps up, beside himself, holding up his message: \nDOC What does he want?  He wants revenge. \nWYATT Revenge?  For what? \nDoc looks at him, a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes. \nDOC Being born. \nWyatt looks down again and it's a long time before he speaks: \nWYATT Remember how I said it all Happened so fast with Curly Bill I didn't have time to think about it? Well I've had plenty of time To think about this.  I spent most Of my life since I was born not Knowing what I want out of life, Just chasin' my tail.  But now, For the first time I know exactly What I want.  And who.  And that's The damnable misery of it. (pauses, looks at Doc) I can't beat him, can I? \nDoc shakes his head.  Wyatt nods then stands, ready to exit, but: \nDOC No, wait, I'll go with you... \nDoc struggles to sit up, sweating and trembling, finally falling back down, almost passing out.  Wyatt puts a hand on his forehead. \nDOC I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry. \nWYATT That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry. \nDOC Never got to wear one of those. \nDoc points to Wyatt's badge.  He takes it off, pressing it into Doc's hand.  Doc smiles then does pass out.  Wyatt exits.... \nEXT - FRONT PORCH, HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY \nIt's late, almost sunset.  Wyatt steps onto the porch where Hooker and the others wait.  He glances back into the house, looking at the unconscious Doc through the open bedroom door. \nHOOKER Don't worry.  They want him They'll have to go over us first. \nWyatt nods gratefully, offering his hand.  Hooker takes it, abashed.  Wyatt mounts up with Johnson and Vermillion.  They ride off at a slow gallop, 3 figures against the twilight sky.... \nEXT - HOOKER HILL/COWBOY CAMP #3 - LATE DAY \nRingo waits atop the hill with Ike and the 3rd Cowboy watching as Wyatt's group rides out: \nRINGO Only three.  They left somebody Behind.  Let's go take a look. \nEXT - HOOKER RANCH - LATE DAY \nRingo and the others ride up.  Hooker steps up with several hands. \nHOOKER What're you doin' here? \nRINGO Who's in there? \nHOOKER It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine He's dyin'. \nRingo squints through the front door of the house to the open bedroom where Doc lies unconscious, chest heaving, sweating. \nRINGO Drag him out here, let's have a look. \nHOOKER I looked the other way when you Did a lot of foul things but I Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin' Man.  Not as long as he's under my Roof.  I draw the line there. \nHooker and his men look resolute.  Ringo smiles, nodding: \nRINGO All right, Hooker.  I'll be back In about an hour.  We'll see how Brave you are then. \nHOOKER I'll be here. \nRingo and his men ride off.  At the crossroads they stop, Ike peeling off. \nRINGO Soon as I'm through with Wyatt, Swarm down with the whole bunch And finish off Creek Johnson and Texas Jack. \nAnd they gallop off in opposite directions as.... \nEXT - SULPHUR SPRINGS CANYON - LATE DAY \n2 Cowboys, Ringo's seconds, ride up to where Wyatt and his men stand dismounted, waiting.  One points to a thicket nearby: \n3RD COWBOY He's waitin' for you by the big Oak, quarter mile up that trail. \nEXT - NORTH ROAD - LATE DAY \nBehan and the other Cowboys wait at the road above the canyon. 30 strong, mounted and ready.  Ike rides up, full of anticipation: \nIKE Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done We're gonna take care of the others. \nBEHAN Aren't we giving them safe conduct? \nIKE Sure we are.  All the way to hell. \nJOHNSON I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too. \nEXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET \nAlert by the shots, Ike turns to Behan and the others. \nIKE All right, get ready... \nEXT - CANYON MOUTH - SUNSET \nVermillion and Johnson are mounted, watching while Doc tries to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness. Though on his feet, it's clear Doc is as sick as ever, sweating and panting, running on sheer animal courage.  Wyatt stands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will him into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time Doc looks back.  Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg over his horse and drops into the saddle.  Wyatt mounts, turns to his men, pointing: \nWYATT All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way. \nJOHNSON Colorado's closer \nWYATT So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us. \nVERMILLION We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin- \nJOHNSON It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end. \nWyatt looks at Doc, who shrugs.  Wyatt swings his horse alongside, suddenly noticing his badge on Doc's chest.  Doc smiles wanly: \nDOC I just wanted to see what it felt Like.  Here... \nHe starts unpinning it but Wyatt stops him, pressing his palm onto the badge over Doc's heart.   A last look around each other then Wyatt signals and they start up the north road at the lope, four abreast, the last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.... \nEXT - NORTH ROAD - SUNSET \nFrom a lookout position above, a COWBOY calls down to the others: \n4TH COWBOY Riders comin'. \nBehan heaves a sigh of relief, glancing around at the others. \nBEHAN Well I guess Ringo did it. \nBut suddenly Ringo's seconds gallop up from the flank: \n3RD COWBOY Ringo's dead \nBEHAN What? \nStraining to see in the falling light, the cowboy on the rock shouts excitedly: \n4TH COWBOY That's Wyatt Earp's bunch! \nThe word starts to spread, the crowd of horsemen BUZZING. Suddenly, off in the distance, the 4 horsemen come into view, coming straight at them at a lope. \n3RD COWBOY They're comin' right at us! \nDown the road, Wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns, holding them at the ready as they break into a gallop.  The Cowboy on the rock jumps down, mounting his horse. \n4TH COWBOY Here they come!  Get ready... \nThe Cowboys line-up on a rise, blocking the road.  They draw their guns.  Wyatt and his men keep coming, now 200 yards away.  Behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning his bowels: \nBEHAN Oh, no... \nNow Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now only 100 yards away.  The Cowboys tense up more and more, biting lips, grinding teeth.  The 4th Cowboy turns to the nearby 3rd Cowboy: \n4TH COWBOY What d'you think? \n3RD COWBOY I think it's time to start Workin' for a livin'. \nBEHAN Me too! \nThey break and run.  So does another.  Suddenly the whole mass of them EXPLODES in panic with horsemen riding in all directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light.  Ike looks around, screaming at them, beside himself as the 4th Cowboy rides by: \nIKE Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em? \n4TH COWBOY Why don't you? \nThe others keep going, leaving him behind.  But seeing Wyatt bearing down on him, Ike finally bolts himself, pounding off hell-for-leather into the hills.  Wyatt and his men keep coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, grim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, superb, and unutterably beautiful.  As they approach, only Breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave.  Wyatt points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting another rise and passing into legend.... \nINT - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nThe CLOCK on the wall of this private DENVER hospital room ticks gently but inexorably as Doc lies in bed with FATHER FEENEY, a Catholic priest, sitting at his side.  Painfully emaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, Doc is so weak it's all he can do to even move his eyes.  But he brightens as Wyatt enters: \nDOC Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds. \nWYATT How you feelin', Doc? \n", "test1_input": "IKE Bastards think they can cheat me? \nJOYCE Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home. \nIke reaches across the bar and slaps him.  Joyce scowls, more irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it.  The few other patrons left look up drowsily.  Ike nods in drunken satisfaction, picking up his rifle: \nIKE And I don't take no mouth from Any bartenders neither.  There, See?  Give somebody a rap on the beezer, get some God damn respect Around here.  Now you tell the Earps and Doc Holliday if I see 'em on the street, I'm gonna send 'em all to hell on a shutter.  You tell 'em that. \nIke and the McLaurys storm off as Virgil and Morgan step out onto the street.  Wyatt turns to them in disbelief: \nWYATT What the hell's going on? \nEXT - ALLEN ST/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY \nWalking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph office: \nIKE I want to send a telegram. \nEXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY \nWe start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim HORSEMEN come galloping out of the desert toward us.  Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne ride into town, trotting by the jail with the Earps looking on. \nVIRGIL Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream. \nWYATT Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though... (pauses, sighs) Guess you better swear me in. \nINT - WYATT'S HOUSE - DAY \nIn tight on a brass-mounted wooden case.  It opens to reveal a gleaming Colt .45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, \"To Wyatt Earp, Peacemaker...\"  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's legendary sidearm.  Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on. \nMATTIE Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. \nWYATT Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things. \nEXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY \nBehan and Jospehine watch from the hotel as the 6 Cowboys, all but Ike armed with pistols, walk side-by-side down the middle of Allen. \nBEHAN I'm terribly afraid this looks Like the end of the Earp brothers. \nJosephine goes pale... \nEXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY \nThe Cowboys swagger by defiantly, giving the Earps sidelong glances.  Meanwhile, the street starts to BUZZ, townspeople beginning to notice that something is happening. \nVIRGIL Here they are again.  Look at 'em. \nWYATT Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on. \nSuddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big gold-headed walking stick. \nMORGAN What're you doin' out of bed, Doc? \nDOC What the hell's going on?  I've Had five people walk up to me Saying the Clantons and McLaurys Are gunning for me. \nEXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY \nA vacant lot behind the OK Corral with Fly's Gallery on the left and the Harwood house on the right.  The Cowboys stand in a knot near their horses, passing a bottle around. \nFRANK Like to teach those bastards a lesson. \nBILLY Probably already scared them to death. \nTOM You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do? \nIKE (grabs bottle) Gimme that. \nEXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY \nVirgil comes out of the nearby Wells Fargo office with a huge Stevens 10 gauge shotgun just as Joyce runs up. \nJOYCE Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral. \nWYATT Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this. \nDoc turns on Wyatt, genuinely shocked and hurt. \nDOC That's a hell of a thing for you To say to me. \nVIRGIL What the hell're we gonna do? \nWYATT Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest. \n", "test1_true": "WYATT You'll never make that stick. \nVIRGIL They're carrying guns in town. \nWYATT Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor? \nVIRGIL (pauses, thinking) No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law. \nWYATT (pauses) All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer. \nVirgil trades the shotgun for Doc's cane.  Doc folds the shotgun under his cloak.  They get set, waiting for Wyatt's cue.  Finally: \nWYATT Well... Come on, boys. \nThey start down Allen, footsteps pounding the board sidewalk, Virgil and Wyatt in front, Morgan and Doc in the rear. Bystanders step aside, trading whispers as they pass, turning onto 4th St... \nEXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY \nBehan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the Cowboys. \nBEHAN They're on their way over here. \nEXT - FREMONT STREET/OK CORRAL - DAY \nThe Earps and Doc turn off 4th onto Fremont St. Creek Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's. \nJOHNSON There they go.  Look kinda like preachers. \nVERMILLION Yeah.  Or undertakers. \nThe vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are fighting nerves now.  Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and nothing like their legend.  It's only Doc, bringing up the rear, who couldn't care less.  Wyatt narrows his eyes: \nWYATT Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head. \nVIRGIL Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'. \nWYATT (sees onlookers) Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this? \nJust then Behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring: \nBEHAN You don't have to worry about a Thing.  I just went down there and Disarmed them. \nVIRGIL You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys. \nThe Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery. Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around at each other, setting themselves.  Now at the end of the sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates.  Wyatt mutters under his breath: \nWYATT Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass... \nThe Earps slow their step, gathering themselves.  This is it, no turning back now.  The Cowboys spread out.  As the Earps get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric with tension.  But as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds.  Finally they stop.  The 2 groups are facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart.  Doc raises the shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face. Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane: \nVIRGIL We've come to arrest you.  Throw Up your arms! \nA weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do.  Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to their guns.  The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their pistols.  Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood: \nVIRGIL Hold!  I don't want that! \nSuddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt and dash into Fly's gallery.  Everyone else stands frozen, breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's wide-open eyes.  Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him: \nWYATT Oh, my God... \nBilly and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, everything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and FIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot.  Morgan FIRES, blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house.  Tom darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt shrieking like a woman: \nIKE No, no, please!  I don't have a gun! \nWYATT This fight's commenced.  Get to Fightin' or get away! \nWyatt hurls him aside.  Ike sprints for the gallery.  Tom FIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse.  Billly bounces back up, howling, and FIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf.  He drops to one knee.  Tom FIRES again.  Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split second.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot SLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off.  Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in his shoulder. \nMORGAN I'm hit. \nDoc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the fight, FIRING wildly.  Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK.  The whole scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling into the street, each man jockeying for position.  Inside the gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in. He snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window. Ike's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear.  He spins around, calling to Doc: \nWYATT Behind us! \nIn a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then with one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken glass. \nBEHAN Come on! \nBehan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their lives.  Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly indestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt,  Wyatt RETURNS FIRE.  Eyes wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the smoke: \nFRANK I got you now, you son of a bitch! \nDOC You're a daisy if you do! \n", "test1_id": 2859, "test2_input": "Doc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest. Frank FIRES.  The bullet grazes Doc's holster.  Frank trudges closer, about to fire again but Doc DRILLS him through the heart while in the next millisecond Morgan FIRES from his prone position on the ground, the big .45 BLAST carrying away the top of Frank's head.  As the last shot echoes through the hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears: \nBILLY More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun... \nHe keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step timidly into the street.  Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted only some 20 seconds.  Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan strides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt: \nBEHAN All right.  You're all under Arrest. \nWyatt looks at him in utter disbelief.  Finally: \nWYATT I don't think I'll let you arrest Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow. \nMore bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing.  The Earp women run up from the west end of Fremont.  Josephine fights her way through the crowd from the east.  She and Wyatt catch sight of each other.  She grins, tears in her eyes.  He nods, smiling.  Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes.  And so does MATTIE who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run to their men, hugging them.  Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his breath: \nDOC You call that shooting? \nFLY (comes up to Wyatt) The McLaurys are both dead.  Billy Clanton's just about gone. \nWyatt nods, pocketing his gun, sadly surveying the bloody scene. \nWYATT Guess we did our good deed for today. \nDELETED \nEXT - BOOT HILL - SUNSET \nFireworks EXPLODE in the darkening sky as a cortege of 50 Cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward Boot Hill, the crude little grave yard, Curly Bill and Ringo in the lead, Ike right behind with the 3 coffins and a banner saying: \"Murdered On The Streets Of Tombstone\".  As they take places at the gravesite Wyatt approaches Curly Bill. \nWYATT I'm sorry.  If there was any other- \nCURLY BILL I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it. \nWyatt nods, tips his hat, walks off.  Looking after him, Curly Bill whispers: \nCURLY BILL Don't worry about a thing \nDELETED \nINT- MORGAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMorgan lies in bed, his shoulder in bandages.  Wyatt sits by him \nWYATT How you doin', boy? \nMORGAN Fine.  Better. \nMorgan looks out the window, staring at nothing.  He looks tired, older, all the fun and youthful zest gone from his face. \nMORGAN You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish... \nWYATT I know, kid.  I know.  Me too. \nWyatt touches his arm, a look of unutterable sadness in his eyes.  This is the one thing he didn't want for his little brother.... \nEXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - NIGHT \nThe Cowboys are gathered around a huge bonfire, sparks drifting up toward the heavens, faces vivid in the firelight like an ancient warrior host.  Curly Bill faces them, bottle in hand: \nCURLY BILL Here's to the memory of Billy Clanton and Tom and Frank McLaury.  They went out real Cowboys, dead game right up to Their last kick.  They won their Places at the big table with Davy Crockett and Wild Bill and Old Man Clanton.  They're up there Right now tradin' shots with 'em. And they'll never be forgot.  Not Ever.  Hundred years from now There'll be men settin' around a Campfire, passin' a bottle, Tellin' stories about those boys. They're what you call immortal. And I say God bless 'em. \nThey all drink, long and deep, Ringo wiping away tears.  Then: \nCURLY BILL All right, first we hang back, Just bide away till everybody Thinks this's blown over.  Then... \nINT - DRESSING ROOM/BEDROOM, WYATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while Wyatt finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his face, looking in the cabinet for a towel.  Opening the bottom drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor. Laudanum bottles, all empty.  Mattie looks up as Wyatt comes out, bottle in hand: \nWYATT Mattie.  What about this? \nMATTIE (looks up, keeps ironing) I need it. \nWYATT 'Least you admit it. \nMATTIE Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night. \nWYATT Look, Mattie, I know you're- \nMATTIE You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold. (pauses) What's between you and that Jew woman? \nThis catches Wyatt off-guard.  He looks at her.  She sneers. Then: \nWYATT All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear. \n", "test2_true": "Wyatt falls silent.  Mattie stands, staring at him a moment, then: \nMATTIE Until you can do that we've got Nothing to talk about, Wyatt. Nothing.  Now leave me alone. \nShe keeps ironing.  Wyatt looks as if a building fell on him.... \nEXT - TOUGHNUT STREET - DAY \nBehan comes out of Nellie Cashman's, spots Josephine going down Toughnut.  He catches up to her, pacing her.  She keeps walking. \nBEHAN Listen, I want to talk to you. \nJOSEPHINE Not now.  I don't have time. \nBEHAN (grabs her) I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man. \nJOSEPHINE My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer. \nBEHAN You whore!  You filthy whore! \nA HAND reaches into frame, spinning Behan around.  Morgan stands there, arm in a sling, red in his eye: \nMORGAN You don't talk that way to a Female human being!  Not ever! \nBEHAN Look, I don't want to take Advantage of an injured man but You better- \nWith his good arm Morgan SLUGS Behan in the mouth.  Behan drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from the blow.  Morgan turns to Josephine, leading her away. Across the street Curly Bill and Ringo share a flask, watching, Ringo looking even odder than usual.  Curly Bill chuckles: \nCURLY BILL So she's Wyatt's slice now.  Looks Like we got another name for the Tally book. \nEXT - ALLEN STREET/ORIENTAL - LATE DAY \nLater.  The Earp brothers stand in front of the Oriental. \nMORGAN Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you. \nWYATT I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing. \nWyatt looks down, miserable.  Virgil looks up at the sky: \nVIRGIL Getting warmer.  Guess spring's comin'. \nJust then Morgan sees Breakenridge passing by in silence. \nMORGAN Hello, Billy.  I say hello, Deputy. \nBREAKENRIDGE (turns to them) I don't want to talk to you.  Those Men you killed were my friends. I'm just a nothing, but if I Wasn't I'd fight you, I'd fight You right now.  So I don't wanna Talk to you. \nHe hurries away, eyes tearing up.  The Earps look on in amazement. \nWYATT All they ever did was make fun of him. \nO.S. VOICE Sister Boy should've stuck around. \nThey turn.  A liquored-up RINGO stands behind them on the sidewalk like an apparition, murder in his eyes, hands thrust into the pockets of a long black buffalo coat, ivory gunbutts peeking out. \nVIRGIL What d'you want, Ringo? \nRINGO I want your blood and I want you Souls and I want them both right now. \nWYATT Don't want any more trouble, Ringo. \nRINGO (steps up to Wyatt) Well you got trouble and it Starts with you. \nWYATT I'm not gonna fight you, there's No money in it.  Sober up.  Come On, boys. \nWyatt turns into the Oriental.  His brothers follow.  Ringo howls: \nRINGO Wretched slugs, don't any of you Have the guts to play for blood? \nO.S. VOICE I'm your huckleberry. \nRingo turns.  Doc stands there, smiling that Cheshire cat smile. \nDOC That's just my game. \nRINGO All right, lunger.  Have at it. \nThey face each other, eyes blazing, about to reach critical mass. \nDOC On three?  You call it. \nRINGO Here it come: one-two- \n", "test2_id": 2860, "test3_input": "WYATT Sure... \nJOHNSON One thing.  We come through this Alive, can we keep the badges? \nWyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward the stream by himself.  Moments later, McMasters approaches: \nMCMASTERS Where's Wyatt? \nDOC Down at the creek.  Walking on water. \nEXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT \nRingo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before him: \n1ST COWBOY We hit him half a dozen times but He just kept comin', walked right Up to Curly Bill with that 10 Gauge and blew him up! \nRINGO Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill? \nRingo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in panic.... \n2ND COWBOY He didn't just kill him, he Burned him down!  Blew him in Half!  I mean all the way in half, Like a melon!  Then he turned Around with that big Colt and Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a Couple more 'fore we got out of there.  But it was his face, you should've seen his face. \nRINGO He's just a man. \n1ST COWBOY You didn't see his face \nRingo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank. \nRINGO You see my face, don't you? \nOut of nowhere, Ringo draws and FIRES 2 shots so quickly they sound like one.  The 2 survivors drop with bullets through their brains.  The others jump, transfixed by the insane brutality of what he's just done.  Ringo draws himself up, in full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, matchless: \nRINGO Everybody get this through their Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm Running the show now and I'm Telling you, Earp dies.  His men Too.  They all die.  Understand? We're gonna kill 'em.  For what They did to Curly Bill we're Gonna ride 'em into the ground And slaughter 'em like rabbits. 'Cause this is my time, children. This is where I get woolly. \nEXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT \nLater.  Most of the others are asleep or talking among themselves as Billy Grounds turns to Zwing Hunt, whispering: \nGROUNDS What d'you think?  I didn't think Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm Tellin' you, this whole thing's Gone sour.  We got hands droppin' Like flies and Ringo's flat out Of his mind.  I mean, hell Brother, you feel like ridin' Against Wyatt Earp? \nHUNT Hell no, brother. \nGROUNDS Then brother let's you and me cut out. \nHUNT Right with you, brother. \nThey steal away toward the horses as.... \nINT - ALLEN STREET - DAY \nRingo faces Behan, grim, intent, while Behan sputters, holding up a San Francisco newspaper: \nBEHAN Are you crazy?  It's front page News all over the country.  It's Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If Things don't settle down soon- \nRINGO You heard me, Behan. \nBEHAN Ringo, you don't understand- \nRingo glares at Behan, his eyes burning, implacable: \nRINGO No, you don't understand. \nEXT - COWBOY CAMP - DAY \nRingo rides up with Behan and dismounts.  A 3rd Cowboy steps up: \n3RD COWBOY Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt ran Out.  Four, five others, too. \nRINGO Who cares?  Separate the wheat From the chaff. \nBehan looks worried as Ike and the other Cowboys gather around.  Just then Breakenridge rides up. \nBEHAN What're you doing here, Billy? \nBREAKENRIDGE Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd Like to come with you. \nRINGO Sure, why not? \nRingo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his men.  His unaccustomed good humor is very troubling. \nRINGO I told you it was time to get Woolly.  Now gather 'round, Children, gather 'round.  And Raise your right hands. \nEXT - DESERT - DAY \n", "test3_true": "EXT - DESERT PLATEAU - DAY \nWyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing closer: \nMCMASTERS That's Ringo out front.  And There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em. What the hell... they're wearin' Badges. \nThey all exchange looks of disbelief, then: \nWYATT Mounts're getting jaded.  We're Gonna have to find a place to Rest 'em up. \nSuddenly looking very sick, Doc sways dizzily in the saddle. Wyatt dismounts, reaching for him.  The others do the same: \nWYATT Doc... \nDOC Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!

Hooker motions down the hill toward his house.... \nINT- BEDROOM, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY \nDoc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in sweat.  The others look on, worried.  Hooker shakes his head: \nHOOKER I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad. \nHis face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc. McMasters motions to the others.  They file out, leaving Wyatt alone with his friend.... \nEXT - HILL OVERLOOKING CROSSROADS - SUNSET \nGrounds and Hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the Whetstones. \nHUNT What's it gonna be, brother? \nGROUNDS I don't care.

One of 'em Rode a Mexican saddle, the other Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt. \nBehan opens the door.  Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the troupe.  Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life.  Breakenridge gasps: \nBREAKENRIDGE Oh, no... \nJOSEPHINE We're headed for a booking in Denver.  They tried to take my Watch.  He cursed them for cowards And they shot him.  He may've been Vain and an actor but he was Better than all of you.  And Gentler and braver.

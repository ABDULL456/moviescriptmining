JOHN I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you. 
McDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight. 
JOHN (explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances. 
McDERMOTT Come on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been. 
JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the "white-coat". 
SARAH The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. 
JOHN How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two. 
SARAH Curse? 
JOHN What is it if it ain't a curse? 
SARAH It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. 
JOHN That sounds like a curse to me. 
SARAH We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! 
JOHN I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here. 
SARAH Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. 
JOHN That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now. 
SARAH Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. 
JOHN You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail? 
SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him. 
JOHN We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we need guns, too. 
SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the jungle. 
SARAH I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. 
JOHN Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie. 
SARAH No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! 
SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears. 
McDERMOTT We can't let her go, John. 
JOHN We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. (He's joking.) 
McDERMOTT The hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops. 
JOHN We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together. 
McDERMOTT God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it. 
THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush. 
78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT 
DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a velvet painting.

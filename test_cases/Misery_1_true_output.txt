PAUL'S ROOM. 
He lies in bed. Sun comes in the lone window. ANNIE sits on the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him. 
ANNIE (almost shy about this) I know I'm only forty pages into your book, but... 
She stops, fills the spoon up again. 
PAUL But what? 
ANNIE Nothing. 
PAUL No, what is it? 
ANNIE Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you? 
PAUL I can take it, go ahead. 
ANNIE Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant. 
PAUL Pretty rough so far. 
ANNIE (a burst) The swearing, Paul. (beat) There, I said it. 
PAUL The profanity bothers you? 
ANNIE It has no nobility. 
PAUL Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored beef barley soup close to spilling. 
ANNIE They do not. What do you think I say when I go to the feed store in town? "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that effing pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow-corn"-- 
PAUL is amused by this. 
CUT TO: 
THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated. 
ANNIE --and in the bank do I tell Mrs. Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard of a check, give me some of your Christing money." 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet. 
ANNIE (seeing the spill, suddenly upset) There! Look there! See what you made me do! 
CUT TO: 
PAUL--his smile disappears. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed. 
ANNIE Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Sometimes I get so worked up. Can you ever forgive me? Here... 
She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile. 
ANNIE I love you, Paul. (more embarrassed than ever) Your mind. Your creativity--that's all I meant. 
Flustered, she turns away as we-- 
CUT TO: 
A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's been ploughed enough so it's driveable. 
CUT TO: 
A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles." 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE CAR 
BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He begins to sip it. 
VIRGINIA This sure is fun. 
She puts her hand on his leg. 
BUSTER (removing it) Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy. 
VIRGINIA Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.

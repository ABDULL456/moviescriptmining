SAL Christ.    Gordy... 
But Gordy's already on his feet, already moving. 
GORDY I gotta help 'em get the bastard. 
51   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - FBI INCIDENT CENTER - NIGHT           51 
A well-lit, sectioned-off area of the garage secured by a chain-link fence. 
Phipps enters.      As he passes Dray, already there -- 
PHIPPS How long before we have a secure computer network? 
DRAY An hour.   They're building it now. 
Phipps moves to a FORENSIC EXPERT hovering over a table of small fragments. 
PHIPPS What do you got? 
FORENSIC EXPERT #1 Pieces of a pager oxidized with trace elements of Semtex. Probably the triggering device. They dial it up, probably from a cell phone, and boom... 
He picks up a microchip. 
FORENSIC EXPERT #1 ... This is the memory chip. I can build it into a working pager and maybe get a number readout. 
PHIPPS Do it. 
Phipps moves to the next work area, where another FORENSIC EXPERT studies video from a consulate surveillance camera. 
52   ON SCREEN                                                     52 
in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later bumped into Gordy -- in front of the consulate. His hat is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his tinted glasses. As the cop faces more toward the camera, the expert freeze-frames. To Phipps -- 
53   FORENSIC EXPERT #2                                            53 
FORENSIC EXPERT #2 That's as much face as we get. He was careful to duck the camera. 
PHIPPS Run a total analysis. I want to know if this asshole's right or left-handed. I want everything you can get outta this film. 
Phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the blast site. Streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on the garage floor. Pieces of the Navigators rest in front of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an NYPD traffic scooter rest in front of the Navigators; "X's" mark where Anne and Matt were standing. 
Phipps crosses to another AGENT. 
PHIPPS Any helpful information coming outta Colombia? 
AGENT Not yet. Sat-Intel hasn't picked up any related data-traffic, either. 
Dray walks up. 
DRAY Gordon Pitt's here. He says he saw a cop at the scene. 
54   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            54 
Gordy, accompanied by Mike and Ronnie, sits in front of a video monitor. Phipps and Dray look on. 
55   ON SCREEN                                                     55 
a police cart pulls up outside the consulate.

PHIPPS The cart was stolen from the Central Park Precinct yesterday. 
The cop gets out of the scooter. 
GORDY That's him. That's the son of a bitch I bumped into. 
The cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame. 
PHIPPS The bomb's in the cart. 
56   PHIPPS                                                          56 
reverses the video, freeze-frames on the cop. 
PHIPPS We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone. The guy doesn't have one in his hands here. Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him? 
GORDY ... No. 
PHIPPS How much time passed between then and the explosion? 
GORDY ... Seconds... Five, ten... 
PHIPPS We think maybe he got into the brown Ford. You see him then? 
GORDY All I cared about was getting to my wife and boy. 
DRAY (to Phipps) Guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 
PHIPPS (beat, then, by way of ending it) We might need to call you in again to look at some photos. 
Beat.   Gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop. 
GORDY ... I touched him... 
57   EXT. CEMETERY - DAY                                             57 
A bagpiper plays "Amazing Grace." 
REVEAL Gordy holding Matt's small coffin as Anne's is lowered into the ground. Gordy's men are around him, along with many other NYFD personnel, family and friends.

LOUIS And a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle? 
RYAN BLOOD Of course it will. Why don't you try one out? 
LOUIS What? 
RYAN BLOOD Yeah, try one out right now. It's liberating. 
LOUIS I'd rather not. 
RYAN BLOOD Come on. 
LOUIS (extremely confused) Right here? 
RYAN BLOOD Here I'll go first- 
Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized. 
LOUIS That was...interesting. 
RYAN BLOOD See? (beat) Your turn. 
Louis looks around. 
LOUIS So right now? 
RYAN BLOOD Of course. 
Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes out more like frightened little girl. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Oh come on! That sounds like you are scared of the battle. What? Are you scared of Quinn? You probably are- 
Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) That's good! Come on! 
Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to jump back. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Yes that's what I'm talking about! 
Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) (noticing Quinn) Quinn?!? Good to see you! 
Quinn grabs Louis' arm. 
QUINN We need to talk. 
LOUIS (to Ryan) Excuse me for a second. 
Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from Ryan. 
QUINN I know that guy and I don't trust him.

CUT TO: 
52   INT. MOYEZ COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY (TEN MINUTES LATER)          52 
Empty and dark. Kevin, Moyez and Pam leaving the courtroom. All smiles. Moyez shaking his hand and thanking him, and then, from behind them, the sound of one person CLAPPING -- 
MILTON (coming toward them) Bravo, Kevin. Bravo. (as he arrives) Pamela, you're looking lovely. (to Moyez) Satisfied, Phillipe? 
MOYEZ Always. 
MILTON Kevin, what can I say? (smiles) Outstanding. 
Kevin, trying to look modest and failing, as we -- 
CUT TO: 
53   EXT. CANAL STREET (CHINATOWN) - DAY (LITTLE LATER)               53 
A street-food stall. Milton paying for Kevin's eggroll. And they're walking... 
MILTON Best street food in the world. Try that. Tell me it isn't great. (as Kevin eats) New York. What a scene, right? (MORE)

MILTON (CONT'D) Guy like Moyez living in that subterranean shithole all the time he's running around with fifteen million dollars in the bank. 
KEVIN You gotta be kidding. 
MILTON What do you think? We're giving you away? He's paying us in goat's blood? I'm billing you out at four-hundred an hour, my friend. I don't see a whole lot of pro bono work in your immediate future. (buzzing here) Seriously, what I like, you got in there with him. Inside the cage. That's instinct. Can't be taught. You gotta hear that on your own. It's gotta be in your blood. It's molecular. I bet I've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet. I couldn't name ten -- couldn't name three -- I'd trust with Moyez. 
KEVIN So what the hell are they doing? 
MILTON What are they doing? They're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They're doing needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk. You, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. You can't help but smell your clients. 
KEVIN I figure you came to court to make sure I didn't fuck this up.

MILTON Maybe I did. But don't get too cocky. No matter how good you are. Don't let them see you coming. That's the gaff, my friend -- make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The leper. The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me -- I've been underestimated from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That's your only weakness as far as I can tell. 
KEVIN What's that? 
MILTON The look. The Florida stud thing. 'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my boots under your bed?' 
KEVIN Never worked a jury didn't have a woman. 
MILTON You know what you're missing? What I have? This beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how -- we're done -- she's walking to the bathroom -- she turns back -- and there I am. It's me. And she smiles -- it's like a veil coming down across her face -- and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the whisper in Nefertitti's ear. I'm a surprise. They never see me coming. That's what you're missing. 
Milton escaping across the street. 
KEVIN So why did you come down today?

MILTON Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine -- that we would take this walk -- that we'd really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth? I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I'm warming my hands on your talent -- (distracted then -- ) Where's the chicken? 
KEVIN What? 
A CHINESE MAN sits in a doorway -- 
MILTON (perfect Cantonese) Where's the chicken? The chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. He used to be right here. 
CHINESE MAN (Cantonese) No, you passed it. Back that way. 
MILTON (back to Kevin, as they walk) There's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic-tac-toe. He never loses. (suddenly) Hey. Like you. Right? (catching himself) Look, I'm rambling because I'm excited. You're in the part of the game I like best. The realm of the True Believers. You are a believer, aren't you? 
KEVIN I believe in the presumption of innocence. 
MILTON Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed.

KEVIN Something like that. 
MILTON No. Exactly like that. It's faith. You're either in or out. You can't believe a little bit. 
KEVIN I was kidding. 
MILTON You're not here to amuse me. See, that's why people hate lawyers. So many of us have lost our faith. Don't let that happen to you. Token? 
KEVIN Excuse me? 
Milton offering a token.       Behind him, the entrance to the Canal Street station -- 
MILTON Learn the subways, Kevin. Use them. Stay in the trenches. 
Kevin taking the token, as we --

56   INT. LOMAX APARTMENT - NIGHT                                        56 
Kevin just coming in from work. The apartment is starting to come together. Still not enough furniture, but the sparseness reads as elegance.

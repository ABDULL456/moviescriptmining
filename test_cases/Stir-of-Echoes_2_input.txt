TOM Uh... Frank? But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside. 
EXT FRONT PORCH DAY It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention. Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt. Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!" Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him, headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back. He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed, jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there -- -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside. 
TOM Oh, God... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is locked. He POUNDS on it. TOM (coast' d) 
ADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!! He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the window beside the door and peers through it. 
THROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living room. 
ON THE PORCH, 
TOM Oh, God, no! Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window. 
INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the house. He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he clutches a 38 with a carved white handle. 
TOM Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please... He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's chest, trying to stop the bleeding. TOM (cont' d) This is really happening.., it's really happening... 
CUT TO: 
EXT OUR BLOCK DAY Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official activity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house. Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've obviously been told something serious has happened and they're desperate to get inside. They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but that's about the only good sign, they're working on him frantically. Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's horrified SCREAM. 
CUT TO: 
INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it. The word "Cacophony" is legible. Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go. 
TOM We need some answers, right? Maybe they're the only ones who have any. She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring. 
MAGGIE I'm sure they're very nice people, but in case they aren't -- She hands a thin black cannister to him. MAGGIE (coat' d) Mace the shit out of `em. He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him. 
EXT DINGY STREET NIGHT Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night, checking addresses. He stops and looks up, at an old, formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times. 
INT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress (VIVIAN) smiles at him. 
VIVIAN I hope you like fondue! 
INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's leaking stuffing. 
VIVIAN Dip away! 
TOM Thank you. Listen, is, uh -- Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils. TOM (coat' d) Is there a guy named Neil here? He's a cop? 
VIVIAN Well, of course he is! She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY, her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this one with a red background instead of blue. Beverly serves two people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the other a HOMEY in his early twenties. Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot, full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and flits off across the room. Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice.

RICHARD Where are you right now? 
SETH What do you mean? 
RICHARD Where are you? 
SETH I'm here with you. 
RICHARD No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother. 
SETH My shit is together. 
RICHARD It don't look together. 
SETH Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together. 
Richard believes Seth's response. 
RICHARD Okay, just checkin'. 
They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into the microphone. 
CHET (yelling into the microphone) Take advantage of our penny pussy sale. Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular price, you get another piece of pussy, of equal or lesser value, for a penny. Now try and beat pussy for a penny! If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere, fuck it! 
Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate. 
CHET (in microphone, towards Kate) What's this? A new flavor approaching. Apple Pie Pussy. 
SETH Step aside, asshole. 
Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST. 
CHET Not so fast, Slick. 
Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till the BONE SNAPS in two. 
Chet lets out a SCREAM. 
Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's NOSE. 
Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth. 
Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK. 
After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER. 
Chet is OUT. 
The whole altercation took two seconds. 
Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at everyone. 
SETH Now, is my shit together, or is my shit together? 
Richard and Seth laugh with each other. 
RICHARD (slappin' Seth five) Your shit is forever together! 
They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second, and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks, 
INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT 
If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and the beer at closing. 
In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers, while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers. 
One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the crowd. 
Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em, but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em. 
Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door. They each individually take in the sights and the smells. Seth is the first to say something. 
SETH Now this is my kinda place! I could become a regular.

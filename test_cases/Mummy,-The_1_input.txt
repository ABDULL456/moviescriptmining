The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers. 
The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless. 
Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back away as well. 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling 
O'CONNELL Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? 
JONATHAN OWCH! That's really got to hurt. 
EVELYN It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this 
JONATHAN Still... 
O'CONNELL Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. 
EVELYN You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys. 
And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT. 
O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room. 
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER 
Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS -- 
EGYPTOLOGIST FENI! 
The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers give one final pull and -- 
-- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. 
Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground... 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement. 
We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS. 
EVELYN Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus. 
O'CONNELL Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? 
EVELYN They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty. 
INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY 
The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing. 
CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM. 
The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon. 
Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside. 
The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING. 
And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD. 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid. 
JONATHAN Well?... Who is it? 
Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned. 
EVELYN 'He that shall not be named.' 
O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK 
O'CONNELL There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? 
EVELYN Quarried granite with a cobalt lining. 
JONATHAN Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out. 
O'CONNELL No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, 
EVELYN A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about. 
O'CONNELL Who was talking about what?

RIKER Don't worry -- Hell is dark. 
Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the Viceroy off him -- 
The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues to pull itself free -- 
Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair. 
PICARD Data, I need you. 
Data joins Picard as: 
PICARD Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize voice pattern Jean Luc Picard. Authorization Alpha Alpha Three Zero Five -- 
COMPUTER (V.O.) Auto-destruct is off-line. 
Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free. 
An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and grinding. 
Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back. 
INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Shinzon stares at the Enterprise. 
A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face. Time is running out. 
SHINZON Target disruptors.  Destroy them. 
REMAN OFFICER Disruptors are off-line, sir. 
A beat.  Shinzon looks up. 
SHINZON Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything on that ship.  Then set a course for Earth. 
REMAN OFFICER What about Picard? 
SHINZON Our greater goal is more important, brother. 
REMAN OFFICER But, Praetor, you won't survive without him... 
Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen. 
SHINZON Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean Luc? 
EXT.  RIFT - SPACE 
The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon. The Cascading Pulse. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse weapon slowly deploying. 
PICARD How long until he can fire? 
GEORDI The targeting sequence should take about four minutes. 
DEANNA But how can he?  He'll kill you. 
PICARD This isn't about me anymore. 
Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do. Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as... 
PICARD Prepare for a site-to-site transport. 
GEORDI (concerned) Sir, we won't be able to bring you back.  It's a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter -- 
PICARD That's an order, Commander. 
DATA Sir, allow me to go.  You are needed here. 
PICARD Negative. 
DATA Sir... 
Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is something Picard must do himself.

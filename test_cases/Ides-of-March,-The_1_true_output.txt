STEPHEN Does it seem that way? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GOV. MORRIS If you have something...or think you have something you want to get off your chest... STEPHEN What's say I do the talking and you do the listening. GOV. MORRIS Okay. 
STEPHEN As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign. Paul is out. I will be your senior campaign manager. I'll draft a statement, "we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc." You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most. 
GOV. MORRIS And why would I do that? Beat. 
STEPHEN Because you want to win. Because you broke the only rule in politics. You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that. 
GOV. MORRIS What do you think you have Stephen? A troubled young girl tells you a story. 
STEPHEN A troubled young pregnant girl... GOV. MORRIS Is that what she told you? STEPHEN ...Who needed cash for an abortion. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
GOV. MORRIS What did you do, give her money? Maybe she just wanted cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up. STEPHEN Is that your best play? 
GOV. MORRIS You need a job that bad Stephen? You walk in here with your dick in your hand...you've got nothing. 
STEPHEN So how did I get here? You're right Mike, there's nothing. No phone messages, no text, no e- mails, no photos or tapes, and yet I'm standing right here. 
GOV. MORRIS Well go home. 
STEPHEN She left a note. The Governor stands in silence. 
GOV. MORRIS How would you know that? STEPHEN I cleaned up your mess. I took her phone and I found her note. They stare at each other in silence. 
GOV. MORRIS I thought it was an accident. THEN: 
STEPHEN You tell me, you were the last one she called. Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion...it also said she didn't want to hurt you. GOV. MORRIS Then why would she leave a note that could only do that? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
STEPHEN Because she's twenty. 
GOV. MORRIS What do you want? STEPHEN Paul's gone today. I set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket. You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong. All the things we both believe in. GOV. MORRIS Well I don't believe in extortion...I don't believe in tying myself to you for the next eight years. 
STEPHEN Four years, let's not get ahead of ourselves. A long beat. 
Finally the Governor says: GOV. MORRIS What were you doing in her room? 
STEPHEN Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one.

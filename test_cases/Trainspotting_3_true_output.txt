SICK BOY 
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success. 
RENTON (v.o) 
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - 
Spud is shooting up 
is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking winds, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit. 
SICK BOY 
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant. 
RENTON (v.o) 
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that - 
INT. PUB I. NIGHT 
Begbie, smoking and drinking, speaks to camera. 
BEGBIE 
No way would I poison my body with that shite, all they fucking chemicals, no fucking way. 
INT. PUB I. NIGHT 
Tommy sits beside Lizzy. He speaks to camera. 
TOMMY 
It's a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning your body with that shite. 
INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Renton's father and mother sit at the table eating. 
Renton is seated but not eating. 
FATHER 
Every chance you've ever had, you've blown it, stuffing your veins with that filth. 
INT. ELECTRICAL RETAILERS. DAY 
Gav wears the corporate jacket. 
GAV 
Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It's not as bad as it looks. While you're here, you don't fancy buying a cooker, do you? 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Sick Boy and Spud lie drugged up. Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks up. 
Renton is standing up. 
RENTON (v.o) 
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words. 
SWANNEY 
Are you serious? 
RENTON 
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite. 
SWANNEY 
Well, it's up to you. 
RENTON 
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.

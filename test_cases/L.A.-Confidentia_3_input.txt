JACK Guy's as cool as they come. 
A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up. 
EXLEY This is Exley. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Ray Pinker wants to talk to you, Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D. 
EXLEY Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him. 
JACK What are you going to do? 
EXLEY I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. 
JACK Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. 
INT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT 
Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett picks up the phone, dials. 
HUDGEONS (V.O.) (over phone) Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T. 
INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley. 
EXLEY Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley. 
LYNN I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about. 
EXLEY Really?  What did White say? 
LYNN He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost. 
Exley lets it pass.  As he enters... 
EXLEY Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. 
LYNN He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink? 
Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back. 
EXLEY Scotch. 
Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks. 
LYNN I'm curious about you. 
EXLEY Why? 
She hands him his drink. 
LYNN Because Bud hates you more than he loves me. 
Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass. 
LYNN It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete. 
EXLEY Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken. 
LYNN The way you've underestimated Bud White? 
Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes. 
As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror. 
REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET 
Two-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic lovemaking... 
INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT 
Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes. 
PINKER God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks. 
JACK Buzz Meeks? 
PINKER You knew him? 
JACK Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg. 
Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn... 
INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT 
Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940.  Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a low whistle.  He's found something. 
INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT 
Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously. 
JACK Come on, Exley.  Where are you? 
INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor. They're quiet.  Then, through a smile:

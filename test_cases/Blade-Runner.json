{"test1_input": "LEON How come you know where Zhora was so quick? \nHis hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's hair. \nDECKARD I showed pictures.  Somebody recognized her.  I went to see. \nDeckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run. \nLEON How old am I? \nDECKARD I don't know. \nThe grip tightens and twists. \nLEON My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? \nDECKARD Four years. \nHe lets go. \nLEON More than you. \nDeckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down faster, like a hammer. \nLEON Painful to live in fear, isn't it. \nDeckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh. \nLEON But that's how it is to be a slave.  The future is sealed off, he grovels, he waits. \nEven hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun, but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley. \nDeckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot, drags him back and jerks him off the ground. \nLEON Sex, reproduction, security, the simple things.  But no way to satisfy them.  To be homesick with no place to go.  Potential with no way to use it.  Lots of little oversights in the Nexus 6. \nHe slams Deckard into the wall. \nLEON I tell you, nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch. \nDeckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one. \nLeon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac- tion of smashing Deckard's skull. \nThe spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog.  Dead. \nRachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward and drops Deckard's gun by his side. \nDeckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles. \nDECKARD Like I said, I don't need your help. \nAfter a long moment, she bends down to touch him. \nRACHAEL You look terrible, you know that? \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70 \nHe's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast, water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking just a little wicked in his balmy luxury. \nDECKARD (V.O.) I knew a cop once who was involved in a high-speed chase.  They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour.  They found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second- degree burns.  On the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse. \nHe takes a drink and clears his throat. \nDECKARD Hey!  I thought you were supposed to be taking care of me. \nRACHAEL'S VOICE What do you need? \nHe doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink. Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll, and stands there looking down at him. \nDECKARD Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite. \nRACHAEL What do you want me to do? \nDECKARD Sit. \nShe sits on the edge of the tub. \n", "test1_true": "She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del- icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her. \nDECKARD You ever take a bath with a man before? \nRACHAEL There's a lot I haven't done with a man before. \nHe's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She watches, not quite sure of the ritual. \nHe pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould- ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under her arm into the privacy of her dress. \nRACHAEL You're getting me wet. \nOh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71 \nThe bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's spread out flat, face creased and puffed. \nHis eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed, but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side, looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then sits again, resting his head in his hands. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72 \nDeckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans- fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73 \nDeckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap and having no luck. \nRACHAEL'S VOICE Sorry, I am not in at the moment, but if you'll leave your name and number I'll return your call as soon as I can. \nThat's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the phone on the floor and leans back on the couch. \nDECKARD Fuck you, then. \nINT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74 \nThe rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the door. \nYou might call this a \"barnyard\" apartment.  There's straw on the floor and several hens roosting against the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and Sebastian pokes his head in. \nSEBASTIAN Mr. Deetchum?  Hello? \nNobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas- tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking. \nSEBASTIAN Now, now, Waddles. \nSeeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the room a pig peeks out from behind the couch. \nSEBASTIAN Hello, Wrigley. \nHe goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser. \nSEBASTIAN Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very good care of you people. \nPouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets his bowel of eggs and leaves. \nWrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for a long drink. \nINT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75 \nSebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to his apartment, opens the door, walks in. \nINT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76 \nHe turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's hand flashes out and catches it. \nBATTY Whoops. \nSmiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is too startled to speak. \nPris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen- ager. \nPRIS This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian. \nBATTY Hello, glad to meet you. \n", "test1_id": 2745, "test2_input": "PRIS I think, therefore I am. \nBATTY Very good, Pris.  Now show him why. \nIt's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet- ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper. Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming. \nThose hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster than the eye can see and slam down on either side of her, digging into the material with such ferocity that Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff- ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like an angel. \nSebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad that the devil is a friend. \nBATTY We have a lot in common. \nSEBASTIAN You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? \nBATTY Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. \nSEBASTIAN Of course not. \nBATTY You could help us. \nSEBASTIAN I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. \nBATTY If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. \nSebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved but helpless. \nBATTY What about your friend, the man who owns this building? \nSEBASTIAN Dr. Tyrell? \nBatty nods. \nSEBASTIAN He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then. \nBATTY Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. \nSEBASTIAN He could? \nBATTY His company made us. \nSEBASTIAN I'd be happy to mention it to him. \nBATTY Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to. \nSEBASTIAN No. \nBATTY When do you deliver your project? \nSEBASTIAN This afternoon. \nBatty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's eyes. \nBATTY Will you help us? \nThere's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he wanted to. \nSEBASTIAN Yes. \nPris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude. \nBATTY I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary? \nMARY I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. \nBATTY Pris? \nPris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him. \nThat has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try- ing to keep the tears from coming. \nBATTY You're our best and only friend. \nSEBASTIAN Thank you. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81 \nRachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a man who died a voluptuous death. \n", "test2_true": "DECKARD Hmmm? \nRACHAEL Have you ever cleaned your apartment? \nDECKARD Don't be fooled by appearances. \nRACHAEL It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody? \nHe rolls over to admire her legs. \nDECKARD Because they would ruin the arrangement. \nHe kisses the back of her thigh. \nRACHAEL They could clean around the arrangement. \nDECKARD I don't like people snooping around my stuff. \nHe kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the bathroom. \nDECKARD'S VOICE There's a vacuum in the front room closet is you wanna give it a try. \nRachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As she starts to plug it in -- \nDECKARD Oh no, don't do that. \nHe's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway. \nRACHAEL But if I don't plug it in how can I... \nDECKARD Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. \nRACHAEL But then how can you... \nDECKARD I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect. \nShe stares at him like he's nuts. \nDECKARD I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me how you would do it. \nReluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the thing. \nDECKARD How about under the couch there. Come on. \nShe bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back at him. \nRACHAEL This feels stupid. \nDECKARD Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education. \nShe drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway down his sheet and she leaves. \nRACHAEL You're sick, Deckard. \nDECKARD I never felt better. \nEXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82 \nMansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck parked among richer relations, including a spinner and a 1928 Dusenberg. \nEXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83 \nThe den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies, and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and proper with an \"egg\" the size of a basketball in his lap. \nOld Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait. Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds. \nEXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84 \nTyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other for their dad's attention. \nFrom the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the house. \nEXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85 \nAnd beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey. \n", "test2_id": 2746, "test3_input": "A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end. A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers: \nDECKARD Hello, Roy. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103 \nDeckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor. He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG. The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is empty. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104 \nMoving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door. \nINT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105 \nExcept for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to- wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the hallway. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106 \nDeckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap and gym shoes, he's nude. \nBATTY You wanna play? \nDeckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway. Pops out again. \nBATTY Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent.  I thought you were supposed to be good.  Aren't you the man?! \nThe makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman- che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol- len, trembling from the thrill of it. \nBATTY This is how we do it up there, lad! Come on! \nIn a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh. \nDeckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be- hind him. \nHe knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head. Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face. Batty kneels next to him. \nBATTY Not hurt, are you?  You better get it up or I'm going to have to kill you.  Unless you're alive you can't play.  And if you don't play, you don't get to be alive. \nDeckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push. \nBATTY That's the spirit. \nLike a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the doors. \nDeckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice. \nBATTY'S VOICE Come on, Deckard, show me what you got!  I'm right here on the other side of the door.  But you gotta shoot straight 'cause I'm fast! \nDeckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty. \nINT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107 \nThe full length mirror on the other side of the room SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand and steps in closer. \nBATTY Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. \nThey're face to face. \nBATTY You don't have a chance, do you? \nIn an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops his head to the side. \nBATTY Looks like I'm gonna have to scale it down for you.  Give you a handicap.  I won't run through any more walls.  Okay?  I promise to use the doors.  Okay? \nDeckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud- denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall. \nBATTY Come on, let's use that brain! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108 \nHe drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again. \nBATTY Think!  We need a little resilience around here! \nHe yanks him further and bashes his head again. \nBATTY Where are those balls of yours?! Let's see a little bravery! \n", "test3_true": "Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry. \nBATTY That was irrational of me -- not to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't happen again. \nHe drops him. \nBATTY I'll be down the hall when you're ready. \nBetty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. \nDeckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo- ment, then punches it with his fist. \nOn his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby. He doesn't bother. \nDeckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns. \nOn the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land- ing below, looking up at him. \nBATTY Where you going? \nHe wait a moment for Deckard's answer. \nBATTY No cheating.  A promise is a promise.  I'll honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor.  You go get your laser gun now.  And I'll give you a few seconds before I come. \nDeckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles. \nDeckard's running down the corridor. \nBATTY'S VOICE One! \nHalfway down the hall he finds his laser. \nBATTY'S VOICE Two! \nDeckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard considers it. \nBATTY'S VOICE No fair jumping through holes.  You might get hurt doing that!  THREE! \nDeckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109 \nHis eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage. He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails protruding.  Too small. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110 \nBatty's coming up the steps. \nBATTY Five! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111 \nDeckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with a line to the door. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112 \nBatty's coming down the center, listening at the doors. \nBATTY Six! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113 \nDeckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at his hand.  It's trembling. \nBATTY'S VOICE Seven! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114 \nBatty's standing in front of a door, listening. \nBATTY Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in here, I don't think.  Eight! \nHe goes to the next door. \nBATTY Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like it.  Nine! \n", "test3_id": 2747}

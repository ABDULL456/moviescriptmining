{"train": "Blade Runner - By Hampton Fancher \nBLADE RUNNER \nScreenplay by \nHAMPTON FANCHER \nJuly 24, 1980                    Brighton Productions Inc. 1420 No. Beachwood Drive Hollywood, Calif. 90028 \nINT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1 \nTHE EYE                                                 2 \nIt's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments surround the undulating center. \nThe eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris. \nThe instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men.  The man talking is big, looks like an over-stuffed kid.  \"LEON\" it says on his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool. \nThe man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all business, except for the sweat on his face. \nThe room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans whir above their heads. \nLEON Okay if I talk? \nHolden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on the machine. \nLEON I kinda get nervous when I take tests. \nHOLDEN Don't move. \nLEON Sorry. \nHe tries not to move but finally his lips can't help a sheepish smile. \nLEON Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a... \nHOLDEN (cutting in) Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can. \nLeon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly. Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke response. \nHOLDEN You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a... \nLEON What one? \nIt was a timid interruption, hardly audible. \nHOLDEN What? \nLEON What desert? \nHOLDEN Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical. \nLEON But how come I'd be there? \nHOLDEN Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you... \nLEON A tortoise.  What's that? \nHOLDEN Know what a turtle is? \nLEON Of course. \nHOLDEN Same thing. \nLEON I never seen a turtle. \nHe sees Holden's patience is wearing thin. \nLEON But I understand what you mean. \nHOLDEN You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon. \nKeeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers slightly. \nLEON You make these questions, Mr. Holden, or they write 'em down for you? \nGAFF Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you. \nDECKARD I'll see you in a minute. \nThe ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot. \nINT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10 \nAn enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief- case and police ID pinned to his coat. \nDECKARD (V.O.) I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6, The Tyrell Corporation's new pride and joy.  Holden was administering the Voight-Kampff test when one nailed him. \nThe door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks through. \nDECKARD (V.O.) The Nexus-6 must be fast because Holden was as quick as they come. The report said there were six of them.  Three males and three female. Led by a combat model called Roy Batty. \nINT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11 \nThe INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of the desk reading the print-out. \nDECKARD (V.O.) They escaped from the colonies two weeks ago.  Killed twenty- three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol found the ship in the desert.  No crew. \nBryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of whiskey. \nDECKARD (V.O.) Bryant's got a liver problem.  A couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man.  I been drinking for him ever since. \nDeckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant just poured for him. \nDECKARD Six, huh? \nBRYANT Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field. \nDECKARD What was he after? \nBRYANT There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one. \nA grim pause. \nDECKARD You got a machine on it yet? \nBRYANT We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city. \nDECKARD Where do we start? \nBryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle. \nBRYANT The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek. \nDECKARD What was the cover on the one that got Holden? \nBRYANT Industrial refuse. \nDECKARD Garbage man? \nBryant nods. \nDECKARD Did personnel have an address on him? \nBryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket, copies down a number and hands it over. \nDECKARD I'll go take a look. \nDeckard stands and holds up his drink. \nDECKARD Thanks. \nLike a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down the glass and turns to leave. \nDECKARD (V.O.) The big incentive to emigrate was still free labor.  If the public found out that their door-prizes might kill them, they might not be so hot to go up there.  This was one of the worst one's we had and Bryant was worried.  He wanted to tell me to be discrete or something. But I didn't give him a chance. \nEXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12 \nAn electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out- side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella, as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden downpour. \nINT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13 \nA heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world; Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded, cramped and darkly alive. \nBATTY Enjoy the view. \nFrom the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem almost invisible.  The view they're \"enjoying\" is through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win- dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW, MEMBERS. \nINT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22 \nChew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him looks like a Charles Dickens invention. \nHe's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent smile. \nCHEW Well, you're right.  This little honey has a couple of defective cones. \nHe snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client. \nSEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se- bastian is a closet genius. \nCHEW You're a regular perfectionist, Sebastian. \nSebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic Mr. Chew. \nSEBASTIAN It's gotta be right for my customer. \nCHEW Your customer, eh? \nChew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams shut behind them. \nINT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23 \nExcept for the work table with its sharp gleaming in- struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye. \nThrough the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through his pockets. \nCHEW You got a pocket-charger, boy? \nQuick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring back at them. \nCHEW Is that good enough for your customer? \nAnxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing his coat. \nCHEW How much is he paying you? \nIn place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat, stares at the bag like he didn't hear. \nCHEW Well, when do you get paid? \nSEBASTIAN Soon as I finish the job. \nCHEW When might that be? \nSEBASTIAN Day after tomorrow. \nCHEW Oh!  Day after tomorrow. \nSebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con- cerned in spite of himself. \nCHEW The rich hate to pay, Sebastian. A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting. Pay the little guy last.  You should charge twice as much.  It'll make him feel better. \nSebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag. \nSEBASTIAN Thanks, Mr. Chew. \nChew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes through quick as a dog. \nEXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24 \nSebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as he heads for his truck. \nINT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25 \nIt's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights. The lettering on the side reads \"J.R. SEBASTIAN - ANIMOID EXPRESS.\"  Sebastian gets in, starts up the engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a jolt that causes him to yelp. \nPRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk- ing. \nBut she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case. Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her and opens the door. \nSEBASTIAN Hey!  You forgot your... \nCLEARANCE \nDeckard punches up. \nBLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33 \nPause. \nScreen flashes: \nSTAND BY. \nDeckard's voice has been heard over the preceding. \nDECKARD (V.O.) Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot. \nESPER This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please. \nEsper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and oiled with a touch of self-pity. \nDECKARD You equipped for random questions? \nESPER Why, yes, of course. \nDECKARD You start. \nESPER The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me? \nDECKARD How do I stop one? \nESPER Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run, \nDECKARD Okay, but... \nESPER I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement. \nThe communication is interrupted by a BELL which is immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE. \nVOICE You are in violation of traffic ordinance M-139 statutory freeway limit restricted by one-hundred and eighty kilometers. \nIn his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard presses his I.D. to the window. \nThe cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's car does too. \nEXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27 \nA district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone long ago. \nSebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb. MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic book. \nINT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28 \nWell stocked with items of survival, all labeled and stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands. \nSebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en- graver. \nThe object of his concentration is a maze-like chip configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care- fully over the contours of the configuration, testing the bonds. \nSuddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures. \nSEBASTIAN Oh! \nPris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand. \nPRIS Whatcha doin'? \nSEBASTIAN You scared me. \nBut he's happy to see her. \nSEBASTIAN I'm working. \nShe's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a little older and sexier. \nSEBASTIAN You look... better. \nPRIS Just better. \nHesitates. \nDECKARD Yes? \nESPER Do you have something against science? \nDECKARD Not if it works. \nESPER And what in your estimation works? \nDECKARD The umbrella. \nDeckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the terminal off button before Esper can respond and the machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out before him. \nINT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30 \nA police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation. \nDECKARD (V.O.) Every government that could was racing to populate their colonial territory.  But emigrants needed incentive.  Over-population and the greenhouse factor didn't seem to be enough; but owning a human look-a-like had lots of appeal. It was big industry, the competition was stiff and Tyrell was top of the line. \nEXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31 \nThe spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open and Deckard steps out. \nDECKARD (V.O.) His claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the 'more' turned out to be a problem.  This wasn't just an escaped andy who broke his owner's arm -- there were twenty-eight people dead and the pressure was on. \nINT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32 \nDeckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard who checks it against a list on a screen. \nDECKARD (V.O.) But so far they'd always managed to keep it quiet.  Not to say that once in a while there wasn't bad publicity.  Some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aun-American for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony. \nThe guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button and Deckard walks away. \nDECKARD (V.O.) But what's more American than good old supply and demand?  The Government needed them, industry made them and the church backed them.  The big religious boys said that Androids, no matter how human, were objects; only God could make people. I'm not religious, but I was inclined to agree. Otherwise I'd be out of a job. \nThe elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting. \nRACHAEL Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is Rachael. \nDeckard tips his head to her and steps in. \nINT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33 \nNo woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi- ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead. \nINT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A \nThe door slides open and they continue down the corri- dor. \nRACHAEL It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit. \nDECKARD A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. \nRACHAEL But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard? \nINT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B \nThey pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor. Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat \"en- vironmental\" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them. \nRACHAEL You like our owl? \nDeckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them. \nDECKARD It's artificial? \nRACHAEL Of course not. \nHands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards the exit without looking back. \nThe exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising stare. \nRACHAEL You're in a very unique position, Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test. \nDeckard has nothing to say. \nRACHAEL Are you apprehensive? \nThe needles in both gauges swing violently past green to red, then subside. \nRACHAEL I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police. \nDECKARD You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. \nAgain the gauges register, but not so far. \nRACHAEL I'd take him to the doctor. \nDECKARD You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. \nRACHAEL I'd kill it. \nBoth needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a sip of coffee and continues. \nDECKARD In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl. \nRACHAEL Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian? \nDECKARD You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug. \nRACHEL I wouldn't let him. \nDECKARD Why not? \nRACHAEL I should be enough for him. \nDeckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little like a grimace or the other way around. \nDECKARD You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. \nRACHAEL I'd never get an abortion. \nDECKARD Why not? \nRACHAEL That would be murder, Mr. Deckard. \nDECKARD In your opinion. \nRACHAEL It would be my child. \nDECKARD Sounds like you speaks from experience. \nHe notes the needles.  One goes green and the other remains inert. \nDECKARD Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. \nRACHAEL Ugh. \nBoth needles swing swiftly. \nDECKARD The entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice. \nNeedles move less. \nDECKARD The raw oysters are less acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog. \nDeckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and switches off his beam. \nDECKARD Lights please. \nThe lights come on. \nTYRELL Well? \nDECKARD If she is, the machine works. \nTYRELL The machine works.  She is. \nRachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks. \nTYRELL How many questions did it take? \nDECKARD Thirteen. \nRachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell. His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang- ing by a thread. \nHe's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock, the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door shut behind him. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53 \nHe slips on the light and crosses the front room. Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out. \nAs he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor. \nRACHAEL Was that your dinner? \nDeckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods. \nRACHAEL I'm sorry.  I called and found out you were on your way home.  These were already delivered to your department but I thought you should have copies as soon as possible. \nShe's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to recede. \nRACHAEL It's the Nexus information you wanted. \nHe takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily. He doesn't even want to ask. \nDECKARD Thanks. \nHe realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence. At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's got something to say but isn't saying it. \nDECKARD Is there anything else? \nRACHAEL I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. \nDECKARD I've already got more help than I need. \nRACHAEL I think you need more help than you've got. \nHe doesn't, but she's not backing off. \nRACHAEL There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. \nDECKARD Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. \nRACHAEL Two of us might be more effective than one. \nDECKARD I work alone. \nShe smiles. \nRACHAEL No you don't. \nShe lets it sink in. \nRACHAEL You use your equipment, don't you? \nDECKARD So? \nRACHAEL So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me. \nIt's a strong look that passes between them -- a long one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but... \nDeckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put- ting it back on the plate. \nDECKARD That's okay, I'll get it... \nHe bends down to help, but she's already done it. Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more. \nRACHAEL Do I make you nervous? \nDECKARD Yeah. \nRACHAEL I'm sorry. \nAnd she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor, almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her. She says it plain and simple. \nRACHAEL It's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication. \nDeckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to do about it. \nDECKARD I can imagine. \nRACHAEL Can you?  I couldn't. \nDECKARD Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females. \nESPER Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position. \nDECKARD Next. \nESPER Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers. \nDECKARD Number three. \nESPER Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field. \nEXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57 \nDeckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already crowded lot, but the sign flashes \"FULL.\"  Deckard doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any- way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and waves him off. \nDECKARD Fuck. \nPissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a lot of room around here. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58 \nFinally brings it down between two buildings hardly enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface -- parking it by a sign that says \"NO PARKING.\" \nEXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59 \nNot many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish small-time clubs. \nDeckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The pulsing neon over the entry says \"TAFFEY'S BAR.\" \nINT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60 \nCrowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part of her juggling routine. \nDeckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a door at the rear. \nINT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61 \nTaffey's what's referred to in the trade as a \"Chicken Hawk\" collector of young girls. \nIt must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale, about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead, lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little room. \nTaffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like a seal.  But at the moment he's not present. \nThere's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through the peeper. \nDeckard is out there holding up his I.D. \nDECKARD Taffey Lewis? \nTAFFEY Yes? \nDECKARD Can I come in? \nThere is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't move a muscle. \nTAFFEY Excuse my niece there... She's studying for an exam. \nDeckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them out on the table. \nDECKARD I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures. \nTAFFEY Of course. \nTaffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures from about two inches away. \nTAFFEY You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for? \nDECKARD Do you recognize any of them? \nHe stops at Zhora. \nTAFFEY This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but... \nDECKARD What did she want? \nTAFFEY Who? \nDECKARD Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could. \nSALOME What the fuck for? \nDECKARD For holes. \nThis guy might be an asshole but he's funny. \nSALOME I don't believe this. \nShe shrugs and they go in. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64 \nMusty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck- ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights. \nDECKARD It that mother real? \nSALOME Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake? \nDECKARD It's a good job. \nSALOME You mean the snake. \nDeckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but she's doing it. \nSALOME The best. \nDECKARD Does it eat? \nSALOME Come on. \nHis hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make contact there's an electric \"snap.\"  He jerks his hand back from the shock. \nSALOME Jeezus! \nDECKARD Sorry. \nSALOME Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh? \nShe slides behind the screen and turns on the shower. Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room like he's inspecting the walls. \nDECKARD They have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing what's going on. \nHis eyes are moving over everything she's got. \nDECKARD You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body. \nSALOME I bet I would. \nDECKARD Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress. \nAnd to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on work but he can't resist. \nSALOME And what if somebody did try to 'exploit' me?  Who do I go to? \nThrough the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat legs. \nDECKARD Me. \nSALOME And who do I go to about you? \nHe looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is short and blonde. \nDeckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit. He stares at her a moment too long. \nDECKARD Hmmmmm? \nDeckard grins and she returns it. \nShe takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently, she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs. \nZHORA You ever get the feeling things aren't the way they seem? \nHer hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way. It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor. He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65 \nBRYANT Well? \nDeckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel. Bryant slaps one in his hand. \nDECKARD She was gonna get away. \nBRYANT Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker! \nBryant takes a couple of deep breaths. \nBRYANT I'd say you got a little carried away. \nDeckard's voice is barely audible. \nDECKARD I didn't like her. \nBRYANT You didn't like her!? \nHe slams the handle on one of the urinals. \nBRYANT You start liking or disliking andies it's time to hang it up. \nThe PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count- ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant caps it, puts it back in his pocket. \nBRYANT Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin. \nDECKARD Yeah. \nBryant shuffles out like an old bear. \nINT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68 \nCheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes. \nIn the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy. \nNot much action at the bar other than somebody snoring and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with himself. \nDeckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand bags and a voice that plays no favorites. \nBARTENDER I can't protect your drinks, mister; while you was in the potty, this hummer snatched it. \nDeckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped over the bar like a beached whale. \nDECKARD No problem.  Gimme another. \nThe whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly Russian accent. \nRUSSIAN Forgive me.  I thought was free drink.  I will pay. \nDECKARD Forget it. \nBut the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck- ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head. It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your heart.  But it's Leon. \nLEON I think I have no money. \nDECKARD It's okay.  Forget it. \nLEON But I would like to buy you drink. \nDECKARD I'll but you one.  What'll you have? \nLEON Vodka! \nDECKARD Shot of vodka, please. \nLEON Thank you very much. \nDECKARD My pleasure. \nDeckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes it and they light up.  The drinks come. \nLEON Prosit. \nDECKARD Prosit. \nDown the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach- es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that Deckard has to look. \nLEON How come you know where Zhora was so quick? \nHis hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's hair. \nDECKARD I showed pictures.  Somebody recognized her.  I went to see. \nDeckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run. \nLEON How old am I? \nDECKARD I don't know. \nThe grip tightens and twists. \nLEON My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? \nDECKARD Four years. \nHe lets go. \nLEON More than you. \nDeckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down faster, like a hammer. \nLEON Painful to live in fear, isn't it. \nDeckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh. \nLEON But that's how it is to be a slave.  The future is sealed off, he grovels, he waits. \nEven hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun, but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley. \nDeckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot, drags him back and jerks him off the ground. \nLEON Sex, reproduction, security, the simple things.  But no way to satisfy them.  To be homesick with no place to go.  Potential with no way to use it.  Lots of little oversights in the Nexus 6. \nHe slams Deckard into the wall. \nLEON I tell you, nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch. \nDeckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one. \nLeon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac- tion of smashing Deckard's skull. \nThe spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog.  Dead. \nRachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward and drops Deckard's gun by his side. \nDeckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles. \nDECKARD Like I said, I don't need your help. \nAfter a long moment, she bends down to touch him. \nRACHAEL You look terrible, you know that? \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70 \nHe's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast, water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking just a little wicked in his balmy luxury. \nDECKARD (V.O.) I knew a cop once who was involved in a high-speed chase.  They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour.  They found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second- degree burns.  On the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse. \nHe takes a drink and clears his throat. \nDECKARD Hey!  I thought you were supposed to be taking care of me. \nRACHAEL'S VOICE What do you need? \nHe doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink. Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll, and stands there looking down at him. \nDECKARD Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite. \nRACHAEL What do you want me to do? \nDECKARD Sit. \nShe sits on the edge of the tub. \nHe pumps Sebastian's free hand. \nPRIS And my Aunt Mary. \nSebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm. \nPRIS And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian, everybody. \nSebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex- cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention. \nBATTY Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along... \nMARY We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you. \nSebastian is nodding and smiling. \nBATTY We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost. \nMARY You certainly have a nice place here. \nBATTY Well stocked. \nBatty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some- thing that sounds like \"Thank you.\" \nPRIS Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much. \nSEBASTIAN I keep a lot of provisions right here. \nBATTY I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? \nSEBASTIAN Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor. \nEverybody nods.  A long pause. \nMARY We haven't found it easy, Mr. Sebastian. \nThey glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to pick up the ball. \nSEBASTIAN How about breakfast, I was just going to make some. \nBATTY If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... \nSEBASTIAN Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to. \nBATTY Well, actually \nMARY We're famished. \nSebastian is truly happy. \nSEBASTIAN Okay, then.  You make yourselves comfortable and I'll bring the food right out. \nHe disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with the way things are going. \nBATTY Charming. \nPris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding. \nPRIS Well? \nBatty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even more pugnacious. \nPRIS I want to know what's going on. \nThere's a punitive edge to Batty's response. \nBATTY There's only three of us left. \nPris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss. \nPRIS Then we're stupid and we'll die. \nBATTY Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home? \nA little spotted pig on the table sits up. \nPIG Home again, jiggidy jig. \nHOLDEN Believe me, take it from an old pro, no matter how good we get, we're never gonna make an artificial anything that can feel.  It's a contradiction. You might as well go fuck your washing machine. \nHolden laughs, Deckard doesn't. \nHOLDEN Just go out there and keep up the good work. \nHolden's whispers have become harder to hear. \nHOLDEN Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting sleepy.  It's been good talking to you. \nDeckard stands. \nDECKARD Thanks. \nBut he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment looking at him, then walks out. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78 \nHe's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative. There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks surprised to see him.  Him too. \nRACHAEL I told you I'd come back. \nDECKARD You did? \nRACHAEL You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping. \nHe likes that. \nRACHAEL Are you glad I'm here? \nHe is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess. She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up. It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail. \nRACHAEL Who is this? \nDECKARD Me and my dad. \nRACHAEL Where is he? \nDECKARD Dead. \nRACHAEL Oh. \nShe puts it down and comes to him. \nRACHAEL How come you're not on the job? \nDECKARD I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. \nRACHAEL How are you doing? \nDECKARD Not too good. \nShe sits next to him. \nPleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him. \nRACHAEL What do people do in the afternoon? \nDECKARD If they are smart, they take naps. \nINT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79 \nThey're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look- ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying a treasure. \nRACHAEL Do you dream? \nDECKARD Yeah.  Sometimes. \nRACHAEL I wish I could. \nHis hand moves over her shoulder. \nDECKARD Wishing is a kind of dreaming. \nHis hand goes under the sheet. \nRACHAEL I mean asleep. \nPRIS I think, therefore I am. \nBATTY Very good, Pris.  Now show him why. \nIt's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet- ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper. Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming. \nThose hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster than the eye can see and slam down on either side of her, digging into the material with such ferocity that Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff- ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like an angel. \nSebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad that the devil is a friend. \nBATTY We have a lot in common. \nSEBASTIAN You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? \nBATTY Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. \nSEBASTIAN Of course not. \nBATTY You could help us. \nSEBASTIAN I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. \nBATTY If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. \nSebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved but helpless. \nBATTY What about your friend, the man who owns this building? \nSEBASTIAN Dr. Tyrell? \nBatty nods. \nSEBASTIAN He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then. \nBATTY Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. \nSEBASTIAN He could? \nBATTY His company made us. \nSEBASTIAN I'd be happy to mention it to him. \nBATTY Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to. \nSEBASTIAN No. \nBATTY When do you deliver your project? \nSEBASTIAN This afternoon. \nBatty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's eyes. \nBATTY Will you help us? \nThere's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he wanted to. \nSEBASTIAN Yes. \nPris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude. \nBATTY I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary? \nMARY I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. \nBATTY Pris? \nPris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him. \nThat has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try- ing to keep the tears from coming. \nBATTY You're our best and only friend. \nSEBASTIAN Thank you. \nINT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81 \nRachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a man who died a voluptuous death. \nEXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86 \nOn a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom. The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of one of the animals. \nHe strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro- ceeds up the steps and into his mansion. \nINT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87 \nNext to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa- tiently with the \"egg\" in his lap.  As the door opens he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The Beanstalk. \nSTYLES Okay, I'll take that now. \nSebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but Styles takes it and is almost through the door when Sebastian stops him. \nSEBASTIAN Wait! \nHe almost forgot. \nSEBASTIAN Can't fly without the pilot. \nSebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in his pocket and shuts the door behind him. \nEXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88 \nMotionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat- ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy heads to watch something pass. \nIn the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion. \nINT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89 \nIt's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion, gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace. \nThe entire family is seated at the table which glitters for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the oldest child. \nStyles hands the \"egg\" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is down before the boy. \nIAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up at his father, then, beaming, pries open the \"egg's\" hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the griffon steps out of the shell. \nIAN Oh! \nBasically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage, the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the edge of the table and into the air. \nThe littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn- ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a dive. \nDelighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan. \nReaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian. \nIAN Papa!  Did you make this? \nTYRELL No.  We can make man, but not a griffon. \nHe bends down and kisses his wife. \nTYRELL Have to give the cottage industry a chance too. \nPleased he excuses himself and heads for the den. \nINT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90 \nTyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and writes out a check. \nHe looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's shocked, but recovers fast. \nTYRELL A friend of yours, Sebastian? \nSEBASTIAN Yes, this is someone who wants to talk to you, Dr. Tyrell. \nBatty smiles. \nBATTY The name is Batty.  Roy Batty. \nTYRELL Oh? \nVery slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side of the desk. \nBATTY To act without understanding could lead to the very thing the act seeks to avoid. \nTYRELL Also you're too valuable to experiment with. \nBATTY I am? \nTyrell can't help a flash of pride. \nTYRELL The bast of all possible androids. We're proud of our prodigal son -- glad you're returned.  You're quite a prize. \nShoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic note of guilt in his voice. \nBATTY I've done some questionable things. \nTYRELL Also extraordinary things. \nBATTY Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for. \nThey share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand. Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat- ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty stifles it. \nTyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small. \nPalms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out of the room. \nINT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A \nStyles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles. \nBATTY Could you tell me where the bathroom is? \nStyles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor, up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91 \nThe birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty observing from the doorway. \nA little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor- porate wife, she smiles. \nMRS. TYRELL May I help you? \nBatty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92 \nIn the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with blood.  Batty is washing his hands. \nA portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up. She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no- tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of her. \nINT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93 \nBooks scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross- legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her like a lover, like a father. \nDECKARD (V.O.) She'd never seen the great outdoors. Never even seen books on the subject.  She went through everything I had, and we talked. And there were subjects we didn't discuss and they were words we didn't say, I couldn't say, like death, like future, like real.  But it was hard because she was curious and full of questions.  She was more alive than anyone I'd ever known. \nShe looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at him, a revelation taking shape. \nRACHAEL You and I are good friends, huh? \nHe considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the wonder of it. \nRACHAEL It's so easy. \nConvinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's pretty irresistible himself. \nRACHAEL Have you ever known anybody a long time? \nDECKARD You mean a woman? \nRACHAEL Uh-huh. \nDECKARD What's a long time? \nRACHAEL Ten years. \nDECKARD Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long. \nThe CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He reaches out and brings it to his ear. \nDECKARD Yeah. \nBatty smiles. \nBATTY What's the point? \nMARY Not to be trapped. \nBATTY You underestimate the trap, Mary. \nSebastian has almost reached the door. \nBATTY Where are you going, Sebastian? \nSEBASTIAN Just thought I'd... \nBATTY No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together. \nThey all watch. \nSebastian walks away from the door. \nBATTY Think of yourself as a light, Mary. Shine before you're turned off. \nShe's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns. \nSebastian is by the window. \nSEBASTIAN Someone is coming here. \nBatty goes to the window and looks down. \nBATTY One man. (he smiles) He must be good. \nMARY Then go get him. \nBATTY That wouldn't be very sporting. \nSebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm around him. \nPRIS I want to do it. \nBATTY Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece. \nA pause. \nBATTY Turn out the lights, Pris. \nEXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95 \nIn the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks around.  Nobody there, just silence. \nHe comes closer to the building and stands in the sha- dows off to one side of the entry. \nHis head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS. \nSebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the pavement thirty feet below. \nDeckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat- tered window on the next-to-top floor. \nINT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96 \nNot much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair- well. \nClose to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep- ing an eye on the stairwell door. \nStepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between the doors, jamming the operation. \nDeckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair- well door, then pushes it open and: \nINT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97 \nSteps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in- to the figure hovering to his left. \nThe man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his chest... but he was already dead. \nDeckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard gets to his feet. \nThe stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence, descends the basement stairs. \n", "test1_input": "The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four- wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't like roller-coasters. \nThe Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend. \nGood place for a breather, but the driver shifts into high and screws on. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41 \nCold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling for the shore. \nThis is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach towards a little camp. \nVOICE We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate. \nDECKARD'S VOICE How do you know I'm not? \nVOICE You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading. \nDECKARD'S VOICE I'm tired of this. \nVOICE Almost through. \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42 \nIn the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen- ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the passenger's view snaps back to the road. \nSuddenly another pair of headlights round the approach- ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding. \nThe Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence. \nINT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43 \nThe good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and read-outs indicating the results of the test. \nDeckard detached the patches from his forehead, which it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to the doctor's desk. \nDECKARD So how did I do? \nDr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise of compassion in his sunken eyes. \nWHEELER Nerves of steel. \nDECKARD No rust? \nWHEELER I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time. \nDECKARD Meaning? \nWHEELER Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to. \nDeckard starts to dress. \nWHEELER During the road test... \nDECKARD Yeah? \nWHEELER Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me. \nDECKARD Huh huh. \nWHEELER Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy. \nDECKARD True. \nWheeler studies his \"desk\" for a moment and his finger comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple statistics. \nWHEELER You got a birthday coming up. \nDeckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks up, concerned. \nWHEELER But you haven't put in for emigration. \nDECKARD Nope. \nWHEELER You're going to be over the limit. \nDECKARD Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there. \n", "test1_true": "DECKARD They'll change the limit before I change my mind. \nWHEELER You sure? \nDECKARD Never been more sure of anything in my life. \nDeckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little touched with his concern. \nDECKARD Why didn't you go? \nWHEELER Too old. \nDECKARD But if you could? \nWheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head. \nWHEELER My job is here. \nDECKARD Me too. \nThey shake hands and Deckard walks. \nINT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44 \nThe referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence, the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but Pris isn't watching. \nShe's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE form above STOPS HER \nIt sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet, sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at Sebastian. \nOn the other side of the room, in his own world, Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering gossamer strands with a laser. \nPris has crossed the floor and is closing the door quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd be the only ones in the room who did. \nINT.

APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48 AFTERNOON \nMary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room. It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and Pris nods back. \nBatty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck. \nBATTY What's going on down there? \nPRIS He's not ready yet. \nBATTY When? \nPRIS Tomorrow, he says. \nBatty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his nostrils.  Like an animal. \nEXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49 \nThe sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk. Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off- ramp curve. \nEXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50 \nMoving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a corner and guns it up a long, steep hill. \nEXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51 \nAt the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise. \nINT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52 \n", "test2_input": "A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end. A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers: \nDECKARD Hello, Roy. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103 \nDeckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor. He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG. The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is empty. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104 \nMoving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door. \nINT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105 \nExcept for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to- wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the hallway. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106 \nDeckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap and gym shoes, he's nude. \nBATTY You wanna play? \nDeckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway. Pops out again. \nBATTY Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent.  I thought you were supposed to be good.  Aren't you the man?! \nThe makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman- che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol- len, trembling from the thrill of it. \nBATTY This is how we do it up there, lad! Come on! \nIn a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh. \nDeckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be- hind him. \nHe knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head. Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face. Batty kneels next to him. \nBATTY Not hurt, are you?  You better get it up or I'm going to have to kill you.  Unless you're alive you can't play.  And if you don't play, you don't get to be alive. \nDeckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push. \nBATTY That's the spirit. \nLike a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the doors. \nDeckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice. \nBATTY'S VOICE Come on, Deckard, show me what you got!  I'm right here on the other side of the door.  But you gotta shoot straight 'cause I'm fast! \nDeckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty. \nINT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107 \nThe full length mirror on the other side of the room SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand and steps in closer. \nBATTY Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. \nThey're face to face. \nBATTY You don't have a chance, do you? \nIn an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops his head to the side. \nBATTY Looks like I'm gonna have to scale it down for you.  Give you a handicap.  I won't run through any more walls.  Okay?  I promise to use the doors.  Okay? \nDeckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud- denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall. \nBATTY Come on, let's use that brain! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108 \nHe drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again. \nBATTY Think!  We need a little resilience around here! \nHe yanks him further and bashes his head again. \nBATTY Where are those balls of yours?! Let's see a little bravery! \n", "test2_true": "Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry. \nBATTY That was irrational of me -- not to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't happen again. \nHe drops him. \nBATTY I'll be down the hall when you're ready. \nBetty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. \nDeckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo- ment, then punches it with his fist. \nOn his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby. He doesn't bother. \nDeckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns. \nOn the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land- ing below, looking up at him. \nBATTY Where you going? \nHe wait a moment for Deckard's answer. \nBATTY No cheating.  A promise is a promise.  I'll honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor.  You go get your laser gun now.  And I'll give you a few seconds before I come. \nDeckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles. \nDeckard's running down the corridor. \nBATTY'S VOICE One! \nHalfway down the hall he finds his laser. \nBATTY'S VOICE Two! \nDeckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard considers it. \nBATTY'S VOICE No fair jumping through holes.  You might get hurt doing that!  THREE! \nDeckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109 \nHis eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage. He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails protruding.  Too small. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110 \nBatty's coming up the steps. \nBATTY Five! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111 \nDeckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with a line to the door. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112 \nBatty's coming down the center, listening at the doors. \nBATTY Six! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113 \nDeckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at his hand.  It's trembling. \nBATTY'S VOICE Seven! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114 \nBatty's standing in front of a door, listening. \nBATTY Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in here, I don't think.  Eight! \nHe goes to the next door. \nBATTY Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like it.  Nine! \n", "test3_input": "Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115 \nDeckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause. \nBATTY Ten! \nThe door explodes! \nA shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol- lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back. but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be- fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut -- his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow. \nBATTY One point for you. \nThe would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder. \nBATTY Ho ho!  Try it again! \nHe comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up against him. \nBATTY What's wrong?  Don't you like me? I'm what we've made! \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116 \nHe's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone. Something is starting to crack. \nBATTY What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover of Faster, Bigger and Better?! \nDeckard's pedaling backwards over the floor. \nBATTY It's time to die. \nDeckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye moves over the wall. \nBATTY Ah! \nHe reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail. \nHe holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard catches it. \nBATTY That's for you. \nOne side of Batty's face smiles savagely. \nBATTY Stick it in your ear and push. If that doesn't work, try the eye. \nDeckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at his executioner. \nBATTY Believe me, it'll be better for you than what I'm about to do. \nBatty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it. \nBATTY Well? \nDeckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117 \nProvocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei- surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds up and moves into the room. \nThe window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out, bellowing in the wind. \nBATTY Crap. \nHe walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he knows.  He spins... \nDeckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight. \nDeckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe again. \nOn the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's ankle. \nWith the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor- ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut. \nDeckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet. \nINT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118 \n", "test3_true": "INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119 \nGroaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath, then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul- ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the railing. \nDeckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers. \nWith his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try- ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's fingers are starting to slip. \nHis face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls. \nThe SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position. He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up. He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over- hand grip. \nLike a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing. \nAnd lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware of. \nDizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs. \nEXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120 \nSlowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard is glad to see it. \nFor a moment he tilts his head back and takes some breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to fall. \nDeckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col- lapses on the front seat. \nINT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121 \nIn a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING that comes from the bed. \nQuietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet. \nDeckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her. \nMoments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed. \nRachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122 \nDeckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion- al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold shine of an icy dream. \nThe clouds overhead are soft and swift. \nDECKARD (V.O.) She wanted to go to a place I knew. Out of the city.  Like one of those pictures she saw.  Where there were trees but no buildings. \nRachael's face in the window watching the woods stream by. \nDECKARD (V.O.) We had a good time.  She told me a funny story and I taught her a song.  A song about monkeys and elephants.  And it made us laugh so hard we couldn't sing. \nEXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123 \nDeckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and hushed before them. \nDown an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light slanting through the clean, hard limbs. \nThe crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth. \nRachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard. Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124 \nDeckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly, mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks. \nBut for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125 \nDeckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin- ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN. \nINT.

PAMELA (CONT'D) 
(SATISFIED) Yes. (answering an imaginary 
QUESTION) Well, no, I don't suppose I do mind. She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Now, really! Flatterer! (then scolding herself) Silly girl. She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the TV bursts into life. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Oh! She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Soap for the brains. She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow-- 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Well, well-- There you are. 
CU: TV SCREEN Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out. 
WALT Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with your television set. This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears. Tinkerbell flies into shot. 
WALT (CONT'D) Oh there you are Tink! She covers Walt in fairy dust. 
WALT (CONT'D) 
(LAUGHING) Hey! Get that stuff off of me! 
(TO AUDIENCE) You know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly! Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and switches him off. 
PAMELA Off! That's how we deal with you. 
EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL 
A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door. 
INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT 
Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there. The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her bed. 
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING 
Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately, not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car and rush round to open the passenger door. 
RALPH Good morning Mrs! 
PAMELA It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I bother? We're just not going to get it right are we? 
RALPH Hm? 
PAMELA Will it be the same driver every day? 
RALPH (oblivious to her tone) Yes ma'am! I'm all yours. 
(BEAT) Sun came out again! 
PAMELA You say it like you're surprised. Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for. It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day. For goodness sake, it's California! 
RALPH It certainly is! He gestures for her to get in. 
RALPH (CONT'D) (trying a British accent) Madame. Pamela grimaces. 
INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS 
Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap. Ralph climbs into the driver's seat. 
PAMELA (as much to herself as 
RALPH) I would so much rather be accountable for the rain. 
RALPH Oh, that's sad. 
PAMELA Sad is entirely the wrong emotion. I shan't bother explaining why; 
IT'LL SIMPLY (she makes gesture for flying over his head) Zip! 
RALPH Okey dokey. 
PAMELA The rain brings life! 
RALPH So does the sun.

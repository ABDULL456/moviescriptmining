Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly. \nWHISPER 3 (O.S.) I just lost my appetite. \nWade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from. Nowhere... everywhere.

The closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARING BACK AT HIM. \nDEADPOOL In the whole wide world, there's nothing as ugly...

Deadpool strides forward in SLO-MO. \nAs they near the carrier a dozen armed and armored MERCS suddenly rise from behind the piles of scrap metal before them. Assault weapons raised, ready to fire. \nThe trio stops, Colossus stepping in front of NTW, sheltering her behind his armored body. \nANGEL DUST (O.S.) No one fires! \nOur heroes crane their necks to spy ANGEL DUST standing on the edge of the deck above. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 64   CONTINUED:                                                             64 \nANGEL DUST (CONT'D) They're mine. \nAngel Dust LEAPS outward, falls like a stone, HITS the ground with a THUNDEROUS impact. The dust clears. She strides over the broken ground, smiling, READY for a scrap. \nDEADPOOL Long term, that's hard on your knees. (ALT:) Super-hero landing! Clearly you're far too much dude for me. Which is why... (points) ...I brought him. \nCOLOSSUS steps forward into Angel Dust's path holding a pair of Adamantium HANDCUFFS just like he used on Deadpool. \nCOLOSSUS I'd prefer not to hit a woman. So please place your hands behind your- \nBOOM! Without stopping Angel Dust throws a RIGHT HOOK from her HEELS. The punch CONNECTS with COLOSSUS's JAW. He goes flying, SCRAPING SPARKS ACROSS CONCRETE. \nDEADPOOL (sighs, points) I also brought her. \nNEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD steps forward on Deadpool's right. \nNTW chews her gum. Once. Twice. Then runs TOWARD Angel Dust, LOWERS her SHOULDER, and EXPLODES UP toward her with a WICKEDLY THUNDEROUS BANG of ENERGY and SOUND. \nYes, Negasonic Teenage Warhead is exactly that - a living, breathing WARHEAD - like her own personal CANNONBALL. \nIt's Angel Dust's turn to go flying backward, smashing into - and completely trashing - a heavy metal shipping container. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) I feel sorry for the guy who tries to pressure her into prom sex. \nAngel Dust regains her feet, smiles dangerously at the Mercs. \nANGEL DUST Never mind. Fire. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 64   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        64 \nDeadpool is already moving as the Mercs OPEN FIRE, full-auto. Deadpool grabs the still-woozy NTW and runs to the nearby cover of metal scrap, keeping between her and the gunfire. \n", "test3_id": 2177}

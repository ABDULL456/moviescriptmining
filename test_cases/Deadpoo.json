{"train": "DEADPOOL \nWritten by \nRhett Reese & Paul Wernick \nFinal Shooting Script - November 16, 2015 \nOVER BLACK. Low volume, through a tinny speaker, JUICE NEWTON'S `ANGEL OF THE MORNING.' \nFADE UP ON: \n1   EXT./INT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        1 \nDEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY. \nDeadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon. The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from the rear view to the road to the rear view. \nDEADPOOL Kinda lonesome back here. \nCUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Little help? \nThe cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice. \nCABBIE Dopinder. \nDEADPOOL (still upside-down) Pool. Deadpool. \nDopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab. \nDOPINDER Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? \nDEADPOOL It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours... (checks `Adventure Time' watch) ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 1   CONTINUED:                                                             1 \nDEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS. TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS. \nDeadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic. \nDeadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY. Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nice. \nDopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes a deep breath through his nose. \nDOPINDER Smells good, no? \nDEADPOOL Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl. \nA PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash. \nDOPINDER Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. \nDEADPOOL Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason. \nDOPINDER Because you hailed it? \nDEADPOOL No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream. \nDeadpool's own heartbreak is palpable.        He takes another deep, cleansing BREATH. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 1   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        1 \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the whole world will taste like Mama June after hot yoga. \nDOPINDER And how does Ms. Mama June taste? \nDEADPOOL Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad. \nDeadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two magazines. \nSuddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood agent who can't find his phone. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave them right by the door so I'll trip over them! Someone must've moved them... \n2   INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          2 \nA blind late-70's AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an `I *HEART* HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP, and CARRIES it OFF. \n3   INT./EXT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        3 \nDOPINDER Shall we turn back? \nDEADPOOL No time. Not today. (slides in last bullets) Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust. (chambers a shell into each gun, looks up) Right here! \nThe cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD. \nDEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets up as if standing up out of an easy chair... \nDEADPOOL On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop... \nHe PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN... \n8   INT. ESCALADE - MORNING                                               8 \nTHROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE.     SMASH! \nThere are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the face as he raises his arms in greeting. \nDEADPOOL \u00a1Hola! \u00a1Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. (ALT:) Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither. \nBOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS. FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING. \nFrom BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE. \nA brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's face into the seat's premium trim. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Rich... Corinthian... Leather. \nDeadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW. \nThe man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V. Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 8   CONTINUED:                                                             8 \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Scuse, por favor! \nThe DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool's head into the console repeatedly. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow. \nDeadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in the PASSENGER SEAT. \nHe GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP. \nDeadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD and BANGS his FOREHEAD into: \nThe horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION CHANGES: \nMARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to MARIACHI. \nDeadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back CRAWL up the tailgate. \nDeadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER. \nBack to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. \nWe're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass. \nThe man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD. \nDeadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man SCREAMS. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Loved your work in Daredevil. \nDeadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man's mouth and CLAMPS his hand over it. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 8     CONTINUED: (2)                                                         8 \nThe man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path. \nThe helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN. \nDeadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into... \n...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY. \nSuddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW... \nThe motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike. \nParts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING. \nInside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass. BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB tied to MOBY DICK. \nThe action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES. \nThe camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down. \nHE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING: \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shit.   Did I leave the stove on? \nWe RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame. \nThe RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN. \nThe bike WHIZZES PAST safely, firing bullets, DEADPOOL follows, leaping high, flipping over the S.U.V. \nHe lands smoothly the other side, right BEHIND a thug who's looking in the other direction as he sneaks around the car. \nDeadpool SHRUGS and SHOOTS him in the BACK of the HEAD at POINT BLANK RANGE. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Six. \nThe shell tumbles to the ground, falls still.         `00006' \nDeadpool opens the Escalade.       His target is NOT THERE. \nBANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Deadpool is nearly BROUGHT DOWN by a particularly big thug with a particularly big AK-47. \nHe dives behind another Escalade, takes a moment to search the interior through the windows... and then flinches as AK- 47 bullets pass THROUGH the skin of the S.U.V. around him. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 9   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        9 \nOne of the bullets lands in DEADPOOL'S BICEP. Deadpool yelps, in pain... then stuffs some of his torn red suit fabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding. \nThen he scrambles AROUND the S.U.V., trying to close the distance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire. \nAnother of the AK's slugs SLICES a swath out of the mask on Deadpool's head, SINGING his hair. \nDEADPOOL. Fuck.   You. \nDeadpool lands in FRONT of the thug. The thug pulls his trigger again, only to - CLICK - realize he's OUT of BULLETS. \nDEADPOOL Someone's not counting.    Cinco. \nThe bullet HITS the thug in the throat.       `00005' \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me gusta cinco. \nDeadpool STRIDES past the fallen thug, pawing at his singed hair - ow - and then out of sheer, pumped-up ANGER... \n...turns and PUMPS TWO MORE SUPERFLUOUS BULLETS into him. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Four.   Three. Stupid. Worth it. \nThe SILVER-HELMETED MOTORCYCLE RIDER makes another pass, FIRING. Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. again. \n20 yards away, a GROUP of thugs TAKE COVER behind the final S.U.V. One pulls out a HAND-GRENADE, RAISES HIS ARM to throw. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) (chuckles) Number two... \nDeadpool FIRES, SHOOTING the GRENADE in the thug's FIST. BOOM! The whole CLUSTER of THUGS drops. \nDeadpool emerges from behind the S.U.V., feeling victorious. \nHe approaches the final S.U.V. and throws open the doors to search, expecting to find his target at last. \nInside is a rumpled orange prison coverall, but NOT the PRISONER. Deadpool gets childishly angry. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 9   CONTINUED: (3)                                                        9 \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) What the shit-biscuit! Where you at, Francis? \nWorse, CLICK-CLACK.    The distinctive COCKING of SHOTGUNS. \n3 final THUGS stand on the freeway, lined up perpendicular to Deadpool, SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER, FIRING BENELLI COMBAT SHOTGUNS.    BAM! BAM! BAM! \nDeadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. and raises a PISTOL. We ZOOM IN through the CHAMBER to spy the last BULLET, POISED in front of the FIRING PIN: \nDeadpool thinks, then LEAPS from behind the `SCLADE, TWISTS forward and right. \nAll 3 THUGS FIRE again.    BUCKSHOT rips into DEADPOOL's BACK. \nBut he LANDS so that all 3 men are now parallel to him... \n...in A SINGLE-FILE LINE. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) One. \nBOOM! We're with the FINAL BULLET as it HURTLES from the gun and passes THROUGH the first man's head... then the SECOND man's head... and SMACKS the third man in the forehead. \nThis third man, the BIGGEST THUG YET, HITS the DECK. \nDeadpool puts his mouth to his pistol barrel, INHALES... and then EXHALES smoke through the pores of his mask. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) I'm touching myself tonight. \nBut then, as if by magic, the third thug STIRS... and STANDS. \nThe SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just enough momentum that it didn't make it all the way through. \nThe thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood, and rolls up his SLEEVES. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Really?     Rolling up the sleeves? \nMERCHANT I don't have a cat! \nWADE Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in? (turns to Jeremy) Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? \nJeremy manages a timid little NOD. \nWADE (CONT'D) Good.   `Cause she knows you. \nWade holsters the pistol and WHIPS out a HUNTING KNIFE. He twirls it adeptly... but instead of holding it to Jeremy's neck... CUTS himself a SLICE of PIZZA. \nWADE (CONT'D) What situation isn't improved by pizza? \nWade shovels half the slice into his mouth, revealing an Army SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO on his forearm: A SKULL WEARING A GREEN BERET, BACKED BY A BLADE, AND THE WORDS `DE OPPRESSO LIBER' (official motto of the U.S. Army Special Forces). \nWADE (CONT'D) (through chews) Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down. (cuts another pizza slice) Little Meghan's not made of money, but lucky her, I've got a soft spot. \nWade brings the next pizza slice over to Merchant. Wade nearly hands it to him but lets go too soon. The slice falls flat - pineapple down - onto the floor at Merchant's feet. \nJEREMY B-but I'm- \nWADE (returns to Jeremy) A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as bad as serrated steel. \nWade pokes the end of his knife into Jeremy's chest, pinning him against the wall. \nWADE (CONT'D) So keep away from Meghan.       We cool? \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 10   CONTINUED: (4)                                                          10 \nJEREMY Y-yeah. \nA beat. In a huge ANTI-CLIMAX, Wade deftly twirls his knife AWAY from Jeremy's chest, SPINS it on his finger, and JAMS it back into its SLEEVE. \nWADE Then we're done. \nJEREMY W-we are? \nWADE Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways. (pats Jeremy's cheek) I've got some hard spots too. (pauses) That came out wrong. Or did it? \n11   EXT.   SKATE PARK - NIGHT - PAST                                        11 \nSKATE PUNKS carve on ramps built into the sides of a highway underpass. A group of TEEN GIRLS are perched at the bottom of the nearby stairs, texting each other from inches away. An old-fashioned GHETTO BLASTER bangs `SHOOP.' \nSALT & PEPA I love you in your big jeans. \nGIRLS (join chorus) You give me nice dreams.     You make me wanna scream... \nBoom. A PIZZA BOX lands at their feet.          On top of it lands a POLAROID PICTURE. \nWADE (O.S.) \"Oooo, oooo, oooo!\" \nA FRIZZY-HAIRED EMO GIRL picks up the Polaroid... of a terrified JEREMY holding another pizza box that has been cut into a heart, the words `I'm Sorry' scrawled onto it, a PEE- STAIN on his JEANS, and a laughing WADE photo-bombing with the knife to his neck. She looks UP to see: \nWade bobbing to the music. \nWADE (CONT'D) You've seen the last of Jeremy. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 11    CONTINUED:                                                              11 \nThe girl - MEGHAN ORLOVSKY - leaps up and HUGS Wade tight. \nWADE (CONT'D) That's why we do it. \nGIRL #2 Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad? \nGIRL #3 How `bout Vice Principal Renwiki? \nWADE (suddenly serious) What'd he do to you? \nGIRL #3 Suspended me for smoking. \nWADE (turns to go) Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig cigs. And I may look mean. But if I give a guy a pavement facial? He earned it. \nWade gives Meghan a smile, turns to leave. \nMEGHAN Hey.   Thanks. You're my hero. \nThe word catches Wade like a punch to the gut.         Hero? \nWADE That I ain't. \nWade doesn't turn back, walking through the swooping skaters. \nA12   EXT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                 A12 \nA grimy SIGN on a grimier brick building reads:         `SISTER MARGARET'S SCHOOL FOR WAYWARD GIRLS.' \n12    INT.

He's got some DUDE's fingers splayed out on the bar, jabbing a KNIFE POINT between them as fast as he can. \nDUCT TAPE fails to cover a big multi-fissured CRACK in the WINDOW of Wade's CRAPPY APARTMENT. Inside, WADE has VANESSA up against the wall decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that have overstayed their welcome and a CALENDAR. They are going at it like RABBITS. \nWADE (raises eyebrow) All year? \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 16   CONTINUED:                                                             16 \nDolly Parton's `HERE YOU COME AGAIN' kicks in, and we... \nDISSOLVE INTO: \n17   INT.

WADE falls back onto a bed covered in rose petals with VANESSA on top of him. She has drawn a heart on his chest in red lipstick. They go at it hard... then pause for a romantic look and kiss. \nVANESSA Happy Valentine's Day... \nThen IMMEDIATELY go back to hard pounding. \nCUT TO: \nA medium shot of the top half of VANESSA. She is on hands and knees, rocking back and forth. WADE leans into frame from behind. \nWADE Happy Chinese New Year's... \nVANESSA (smiles) Year of the Dog. \nThey go at it even harder. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nThe same exact locked-off medium shot, only WADE is now on hands and knees. His expression betrays great stress. VANESSA leans into frame from behind. \nVANESSA (CONT'D) Relax...

If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas... \nWADE strikes a pose, HANDS on HIPS, wearing an AWFUL, AWFUL CHRISTMAS SWEATER. And NO PANTS. \nVANESSA sits against the bed's HEADBOARD, SHEET pulled over her, up to her chin. She quickly lowers the sheet. Revealing an APPALLING CHRISTMAS SWEATER of her own. \nWADE (CONT'D) ...can I visit you between the holidays? \nWade peels off his Christmas sweater... and STEPS CONFIDENTLY BACK TOWARD THE BED. But before he gets there... \nDEADPOOL (V.O.) ...to our regularly scheduled program. \n...HE PASSES OUT, FACE-PLANTING ONTO THE FLOOR. \n19   INT.

The LOOK on the DOCTOR's FACE. \nWADE You're clowning.     You're not clowning?

Blades implanted into wrists. \nIn the exact same POSE we just saw the real Deadpool. Sitting in a nightstand DRAWER in Wade's apartment. \nWADE (O.S.) This is my most prized possession. \nWade looks like he's reaching into the drawer for the action figure, but instead, reaches just UNDER it to grasp Wham!'s `Make it Big' album on Vinyl. He pulls out the album. \nVANESSA Wham? \nWADE Wham! (cradles album lovingly) `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point. \nWade places the album carefully into one of two OPEN SUITCASES on the floor next to him. He is currently going through his possessions, TOSSING OUT the crap and placing the good stuff into the suitcases. \nWade pulls out the action figure. \nWADE (CONT'D) But this. A little piece of me died the day this came out... \nWade DUNKS the action figure in the trash can.         VANESSA stands opposite, arms crossed, FUMING. \nVANESSA So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave you out the door? \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 21   CONTINUED:                                                             21 \nWADE Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death. (pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE) If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters. (opens purse, it's full of nickels) Looks like I do. \nWade TOSSES the purse toward one of the suitcases.           Vanessa's hand stabs out and GRABS it. \nVANESSA Bernadette's not going anywhere. (slam-dunks purse back into drawer) `Cause you're not going anywhere. \nWADE (CONT'D) She sent away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice this time of... never. Then there's China... Central Mexico... Know how they say `Cancer' in Spanish? \u00a1El C\u00e1ncer.' \nWade pulls out one last thing from his pockets: A POLAROID of HIMSELF and VANESSA. He stares. Weasel notices. \nWEASEL This belongs on the wall. I want to remember you when you looked... alive. \nWade scrapes up a smile as Weasel tapes the picture to the BIG BAR MIRROR. Weasel pours a second wheatgrass shot. Clinks Wade's glass. They throw them back. WINCE. \nWEASEL (CONT'D) Almost forgot... \nWeasel slides Wade a distinctive black BUSINESS CARD across the bartop. \nWEASEL (CONT'D) Guy came in asking for you.     Real Grim Reaper type. \nWade's gaze follows Weasel's gesture across the barroom, where an ominous MAN in a BLACK SUIT sits ALONE at a table. \nWEASEL (CONT'D) I don't know?

Wade stops next to the MAN's TABLE. \nWADE Forget your scythe? \nThe man, even creepier from close up, SMILES. \nRECRUITER Mr. Wilson. Have a seat. (Wade sits, long pause) I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. \nWADE Stalker alert. \nRECRUITER It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills? \nWADE (bitter) One every seven weeks.     Same rate most folks get a hair-cut. \nWade grabs the recruiter's drink and throws it back. \nWADE (CONT'D) To wash the taste out.

Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of? \nWADE I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. (jack-off motion) \nRECRUITER The world needs extraordinary men. We won't just make you better. We'll make you better than better. A super-hero. \nWADE I already tried the hero business.

For now, I'll get through this with the one I love. \nA sickly-looking WADE is on the final stop in his futile quest to find a cure. DESPERATE. Among the MOST DESPERATE. \nHe sits in a pathetic muzak-filled WAITING ROOM. Wearing a SOMBRERO and clutching VANESSA's hand. Her fingers are interlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed to the quick. \nVanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face. \nWade COUGHS SEVERELY, REPEATEDLY into a HANDKERCHIEF. \nWade turns to the sweet ELDERLY COUPLE sitting next to him, ekes out a smile.

Sorry - \u00bfEl C\u00e1ncer? \nDelgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS. \nWade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop. \nThe doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle. \n26   INT.   WAITING ROOM / HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST                          26 \nThe MUZAC still plays.

He straddles the DOCTOR's CHEST. His expression is that of a man who's LOSING his SHIT. \nWade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles, and falls still. \nChest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END of the HALL: \nVANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?' This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past... \n...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 27   CONTINUED:                                                             27 \nAwash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken blood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door at the end of the hall at a RUN. \n28   STAB!                                                                  28 \nThe sword, covered in BLOOD, penetrates the crayon drawing of the recruiter on DEADPOOL's CORKBOARD. \nDEADPOOL Thank you, Agent Smith. \nDeadpool lasers in on AJAX's picture at the top of the pyramid. \n29   EXT.    GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST                             29 \nWADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back toward her voice, face a mask of pain.

He speaks to the AUDIENCE: \nDEADPOOL Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind. \nPOPS INSIDE \nDEADPOOL (V.O.) And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too. \n31   INT.

He's being wheeled down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES. \nIn one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD. In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING, as tight as his shaky hand allows. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 31   CONTINUED:                                                               31 \nThey turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just inside the doors, smiling. \nRECRUITER (O.S.) Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like a change of someone else's. \nWalking into Wade's P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER.             He beams down on Wade. \nRECRUITER (CONT'D) You finally hit `fuck-it.' \nWADE Worse.  Just promise you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else. \nRECRUITER Of course. \nWADE Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated. \nRECRUITER I hope you enjoy your stay. \nThe `Workshop,' as this old warehouse is affectionately called, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. \nWade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows of individual `tents,' each containing a SUBJECT. Wade's eyes DART to helpless SILHOUETTES. \nWe hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. \nA FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but quickly moves on by. \nWade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's eyes. \nThe tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights.             Wade spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. \nWade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 31   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      31 \nSCALPELS MAKE LONG INCISIONS. \nENDOSCOPIC CAMERAS TRAVEL THROUGH THE BODY, REVEALING THE DIRTY WORK OF INVASIVE SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. \nSTAPLE-GUNS DRIVE STAPLES INTO SLICED SKIN TO PULL IT BACK TOGETHER. \nMINIATURE CIRCULAR SAWS SLICE THROUGH BONE. \nIV's PULL FLUIDS FROM THE BODY AND INSERT OTHER FLUIDS IN. \nJOHN DENVER I want to share what I can give.

Name like Francis. \nAjax is very subtly SURPRISED.      WHAT did Wade just say?       WADE is still strapped down inside.      Talking nice and LOUD: \nWADE (CONT'D) That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish- washing liquid! (laughs from nearby tents) Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. \nAjax has ENTERED Wade's tent.

Deadpool's eyes raise from the purse to the woman holding it: BERNADETTE PETERS HERSELF! Deadpool doubletakes, then shakes his head (`Nah, couldn't be...') and climbs into the cab.

Next to him, four identical crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up into the truck. \nANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns at the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer. \nAjax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe. \nHe steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letting it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank. \nAJAX (O.S.)

He's moving too fast for their guns to track. Bullets chew up the ground behind. \nDeadpool reaches the first pile of twisted metal, slides under, comes up behind two mercs taking shelter there. The first man turns, gun barrel swinging `round. Deadpool ducks, sweeps his legs, grabs his gun as he goes down. \nDeadpool rolls over him, firing BACKWARD into the man's face while spinning up to smash his boot into the face of the second merc.

DEADPOOL runs toward them, flips and dodges like a whirling dervish, bringing GUARDS down in surgical, artistic fashion, as if where he's killing them means as much to him as how. \nTwo men converge    on Deadpool. He JUMPS. Mid-air, he flips his TWO KATANAS,    GRIPS them upside-down like ICE PICKS, and STABS down in an    arc to either side, SKEWERING two men through the TOPS    of their HELMETS. \nA final merc comes around the corner and Deadpool spins, slices the strap of his gun, kicks the man in the chest, knocking him flat on his back and sitting on his face. \nDEADPOOL Tea-bag!

The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny BREATH.

AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel. Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck, barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings. \nFinally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool hollers. \nDeadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD. \nDeadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp. A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first. \nNow they're completely unarmed. \nAJAX Fine.   Fists. \nDEADPOOL Sounds like your last Saturday night.

Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain, YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently. \nBut it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off. \nJOHN DENVER I want to liiiiiive! \n71   EXT.

(off Deadpool's impressed look, shrugs) Or wear red. \nDeadpool's eyes light up. He crumples this suit into a ball and tosses it into a trash bin. \nE44/H44 INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - NIGHT                                    E44/H44 \nDeadpool stabs a KNIFE into the picture of the GOON he just killed (at the bottom of the pyramid)... right in the FOREHEAD. \nF44    INT.    LAIR - NIGHT                                                   F44 \nDEADPOOL's at the sewing machine again. \nQuick cuts of a RED `proto' outfit going on: Cheap red sweats. Red gloves. Red converse. As yet unseen RED MASK, which turns out to be... \nVG44   INT.    UNDERGROUND FIGHT - NIGHT                                     VG44 \n...a RED `LUCHA LIBRE' PRO WRESTLING MASK. \nDeadpool stands in the shadows of a dingy basement, low ceilings, walls stacked high with cases of liquor. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 VG44   CONTINUED:                                                           VG44 \nIn a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN pound each other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spies his mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside. \nDeadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwing men aside, PLOWING toward his target. \nThe mark sees Deadpool at the last second, turns as a KATANA flashes out and skewers his hand, pinning it to the wall. Deadpool fires a couple shots into the ceiling, sending the rest of the crowd rushing for the exit. \nDEADPOOL Don't make me ask twice.      Where's- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nJ44    INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - INTERROGATIONS/KILLS                    J44 \nDeadpool has a goon at sword-point. \nDEADPOOL Donde esta Francisco? \nTHUG I don't speak Spanish. \nDEADPOOL (sighs) And I don't have time for you to learn. \nDeadpool kills the thug. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Take me to your leader. (turns) I've always wanted to say that. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) Squeal.     Like a pig. Where's Francis? \nDEADPOOL In no particular order. Where's your boss? And where can I find good Indian food? \nHENCHMAN Why the red suit? \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 J44   CONTINUED:                                                           J44 \nDEADPOOL That's so bad guys can't- never mind, they've already heard that. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) You're about to tell me everything you know about Francis Freeman. Known aliases. Current whereabouts. Boxers or briefs. Go. \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) (forces guy's mouth open, goes in with knife) Open your mouth. Here comes the airplane! \nGOON (gun pointed at forehead, a la Joseph Takagi) I don't know, I'm telling you. You're just going to have to kill me. \nDEADPOOL OK. (shoots goon in head, a la Hans Gruber, then, to audience:) Right?! \nDEADPOOL (CONT'D) (goon at knifepoint) Don't make me break out the Collective Soul CDs. \nDEADPOOL You give me your boss.     I give you the rest of your life. \n(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 J44    CONTINUED: (2)                                                      J44 \nDEADPOOL (throws woman onto table) I don't feel good about myself.     But where is he? I'm so sorry. \nL44    EXT./INT.    MONTAGE - VARIOUS                                      L44 \nNew COSTUME.     BOOM.   A MAN dies. \nSTAB.

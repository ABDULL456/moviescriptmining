CRUNCH!  Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest.  All this gave Freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head. The pummeling begins again. 
THWACK THWACK THWACK!  Power Cop is punching Freddy towards the door. 
EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN 
Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors and somersaults onto the pavement.  Sound Cop is a few yards away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.  He looks up as Freddy sneers. 
FREDDY No more playing around. 
Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.  It grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look soft at all.  Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, and raises his giant hammer hand.  Power Cop steps through, looking for blood.  Sound Cop tries to warn him. 
SOUND COP Kincaid! 
Too late.  BAM!  Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's head.  He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet - trapped at the legs. 
BAM!  Freddy hits him again.  Power Cop is down to his thighs and he can't get out. 
A RUMBLING is heard.  Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting to open his mouth.  Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop. 
FREDDY Put a lid on it! 
THUNK!  The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.  Sound Cop reels from the impact.  Tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug. 
Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!  Hits him down to his hips.  The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground. 
Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling Sound Cop. 
Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING.  Pressure seems to be building up, something's gonna blow.  Freddy picks up a boulder from the street rubble.  He catapults it with both hands at Sound Cop.  The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN OFF. 
Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of his neck with a SCREECH. 
Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over limply. 
Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE embeds itself in his back.  Krueger spins around. 
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Three more knives slam into his body as he staggers back in surprise.  Blade Cop stands twenty feet away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after knife, flinging them at Freddy.  They sail like flying bullets. 
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Krueger falls back from the sheer force of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his body. 
Blade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what Freddy will do next. 
Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.  Then he grins.  His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body builder and flexes every muscle. 
POP POP POP!  The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, CLATTERING to the ground. 
The girl in black steps back and raises her arms.  SHINK SHINK!  Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms. They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.  She crosses the blades in front of her. 
FREDDY (cont'd) (smiling) Ah... a girl after my own heart. 
KACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND to double their normal size.  He raises them and takes on a fencing stance. 
FREDDY (cont'd) En guard, bitch 
SWOOP/CLANG!  A swordfight ensues.  Freddy swinging his four long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, they parry, they leap, they duck. 
CLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper hand. 
CLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right behind it on the follow-through. 
Freddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER. 
Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little blood.  They pause for a second. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Touche. 
And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand. 
Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump. 
Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate. 
JACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away. 
Blade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then one of Blade's arms. 
CLOSE ON JACOB 
as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action that's moving too fast for him to see. 
Then there's silence.

STEVEN Thank you. 
With great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and makes his exit. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing... 
28   EXT. GROCERY RECEIVING DOCK - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY             28 
An OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER. 
Tomato crates are all around. 
STEVEN (V.O.) It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade. 
PRODUCE MANAGER These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right? 
STEVEN (big smile) Finest in the land... 
And as they talk- 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) It's called `field buying'. I could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough. 
29   INT. MIAMI JEWELRY STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                 29 
Steven stands before a SALESPERSON at a counter. 
SALESWOMAN Cash or charge? 
STEVEN Charge... 
Steven flips through a handful of identical CREDIT CARDS. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   19. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) (sotto) Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell... (seeing one he likes) Ah! 
He gives a card to a smiling SALESWOMAN. 
SALESWOMAN Thank you... (reading card) ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID? 
STEVEN Of course. 
And as Steven riffles through an equally large stack of DRIVER'S LICENSES... 
30   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                      30 
Steven stands atop a escalator, looking around. 
STEVEN (V.O.) But when money got really tight, the slip and fall always came in handy. 
He throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the floor below. Painful tumbling is heard. 
At the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.      A beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame. 
31   INT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 31 
CHRISTMAS MUSIC. 
Dressed in pajamas, Steven and Kemple sit cross-legged at the base of their Christmas Tree, surrounded by torn paper and strewn gifts. Steven's arm is in a cast. 
Kemple opens a hinged case to reveal a GOLD Rolex watch. 
KEMPLE Oh wow... 
STEVEN What do you think? Yes? "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages       5-23-08   20. 
KEMPLE Well Steven it's beautiful.     It really is. 
STEVEN You don't like it. 
KEMPLE No, no, no.   I do. 
STEVEN You don't like it. 
KEMPLE I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me. 
STEVEN Tell me what's wrong with it.        Is it the gold? 
KEMPLE Well... 
STEVEN That's why I got you the stainless! 
He takes out another box and hands it to Kemple. 
KEMPLE Steven! 
As he opens it, Steven grabs the gold Rolex. 
STEVEN The gold one is for me, dipshit. 
Kemple smiles broadly as he admires his new watch.

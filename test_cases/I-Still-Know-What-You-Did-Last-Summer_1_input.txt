NANCY Not anymore. 
TYRELL He leave you? 
NANCY No. I shot him. 
Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance. 
NANCY (cont'd) What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me. 
ACROSS THE BAR 
Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another. 
JULIE Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- 
KARLA He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... (off Julie's look) But... 
JULIE (appologetic) I miss Ray...I tried to call him. 
Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm. 
KARLA Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours. 
Joining the men, but continuing her thought -- 
KARLA (cont'd) For the next foury-eight hours... (joking) Your smile is a frown...turned upside down. 
She illustrates with her own big smile. 
TYRELL Pretty cool bar. 
KARLA They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. (to Nancy) Am I right, sister? 
Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their fingers. 
JULIE (to Nancy) I'm Julie. This is Karla. 
NANCY Nancy. (sarcastic) Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot. 
Nancy continues making their cocktails. 
JULIE 
backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER. 
She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her. 
Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them. 
NANCY Four Dark and Stormies... 
They all pick up their drinks. 
KARLA (toasting) To a great weekend -- 
WILL Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! 
KARLA & JULIE I'll drink to that! 
They drink and toast again. 
KARLA (to Nancy) So what do you do around here for fun? 
Nancy looks straight at Will -- 
NANCY Make fun of tourists mainly. (beat) Or let them make fun of themselves... 
She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage. 
KARLA Karaoke -- perfect. 
JULIE Don't even think about it. 
KARLA Okay, I won't. 
She's already heading for the stage. 
TYRELL Go baby! Go! 
AT THE STAGE 
CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of songs. 
KARLA Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it. (finds one) Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese! 
NANCY (it's true) Everyone thinks their a singer. 
JULIE No way. 
KARLA Yes. 
JULIE No.

GIDEON GRAVES Geez buddy, it's gonna be alright. 
91 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 91 
SCOTT No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch. 
(CONTINUED) 
INTEGRATED FINAL 104. 
91 CONTINUED: 91 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S) Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm opening a new Chaos Theatre in Toronto and The Sex Bobs are playing our grand opening tonight, and it would feel really weird for all of us if you weren't there. They just did a sound check and the acoustics in here are amazing. 
SCOTT 
(GRIM) Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there. 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) I hope so, amigo. I don't want anymore bad blood between ex's. What do you say? 
SCOTT Mm. 
GIDEON GRAVES Okay laters. Click. 
WALLACE (O.S.) What a perfect asshole. Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless. 
WALLACE Forget what I said earlier. Finish him. 
92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92 
Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall. 
HIPSTER KID Password? Scott shrugs. 
SCOTT Whatever. 
HIPSTER KID Cool. The Hipster Kid waves Scott in. 
INTEGRATED FINAL 104A. 
93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93 
The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator. 
HIPSTER KID Second password? Scott gives the slightest shrug. 
HIPSTER KID Cool. Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good. 
INTEGRATED FINAL 105. 
94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94 
Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE. All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them. 
COMEAU Yeah, their first album is so much better than their first album. Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song. 
STEPHEN STILLS Scott! Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates. 
STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D) Let it go. Don't give him the satisfaction. 
SCOTT What if I want the satisfaction? 
STEPHEN STILLS Well, then you're doomed. 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Scott Pilgrim! Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side. 
GIDEON GRAVES Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre. Somebody get this man a drink! Coke Zero right? A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero. Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR! 
SCOTT I'm not here to drink. 
GIDEON GRAVES I got no beef with you. 
SCOTT What if I have a beef...with you? 
(CONTINUED) 
INTEGRATED FINAL 106. 
94 CONTINUED: 94 
GIDEON GRAVES Are you still mad about that whole thing with the Guild? 
SCOTT You mean 'The League'? 
GIDEON Guild, League, whatever. It's ancient history. Gideon puts his arm around Ramona. 
SCOTT I'll show you how ancient of history it is. Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool. 
GIDEON GRAVES No use crying over spilt Coke, buddy. The lady made her choice and we're all gonna have to move on. 
SCOTT Well I ain't moving...buddy. 
GIDEON GRAVES You want to fight me for her? 
SCOTT Was that not clear? (to Sex Bob-Omb) Was that not clear? Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes. 
GIDEON GRAVES Now why on earth do you want to do that? 
SCOTT Because, I'm in love with her. Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Scott earned the power of love... Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles. 
GIDEON GRAVES I think this deserves a song. Kimberly? 
(CONTINUED) 
INTEGRATED FINAL 107. 
94 CONTINUED: (2) 94 Kim scratches her head with her middle finger before grudgingly launching into a number. 
KIM PINE We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to make money, and sell out and stuff. Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at Arly. 
ARLY (sincerely -- after a pause) She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- honest, and helpless. 
Rocklin makes no reply. 
ARLY Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me. 
Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight. 
ROCKLIN You might's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin' to get me. 
ARLY Don't be so sure -- I don't think I'm doin' so badly. 
ROCKLIN Don't you? 
ARLY Don't you know? 
ROCKLIN I know there ain't a dirty trick you wouldn't play to get what you want. 
ARLY (smiling) I always get what I want. 
She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her. 
ARLY -- See? (opens the door) -- 'Bye now -- 
The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it. 
CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper 
BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and stretches out on the bed, as we 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance toward the gate. 
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her room. 
INT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she freezes to the spot. 
ON 
Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara. 
The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt. 
MISS MARTIN (quietly but viciously) Whatever is to become of you? 
Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell. 
MISS MARTIN Have you no sense of pride, or decency? Throwing yourself at that -- that wretch, like any shameless hussy. 
Clara hasn't moved. 
MISS MARTIN I thought we'd done with him -- but no -- you have to run to him and tell him all our business -- 
Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now. 
MISS MARTIN Don't you dare deny it -- you know very well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey. 
Clara remains silent. 
MISS MARTIN Didn't you? -- 
Clara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes still rivited on the girl, follows. 
MISS MARTIN Didn't you? 
DISSOLVE 
INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the door. 
LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter: 
Mr. Garvey, 
I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to have you investigated. I thought you had better know about it. 
E.M. 
BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses Sammy. 
GARVEY Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care of everything. 
SAMMY -- You take clare of evelything. 
DISSOLVE OUT

INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in the light of a lamp.

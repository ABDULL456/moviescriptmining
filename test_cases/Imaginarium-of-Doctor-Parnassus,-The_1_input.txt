VALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles - slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention. 
PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him. 
PERCY Five souls.. two days, eh!? 
DR. PARNASSUS Shh! I'm trying to think. 
PERCY I told you didn't I? 
DR. PARNASSUS What? 
PERCY That he was a wrong-un. 
PERCY nods his head in George's direction.

DR. PARNASSUS Trust in providence, Percy. Remember the hanging man. The cards don't lie. 
PERCY No... but they sure as hell like being economical with the truth. 
CUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed, wooden flower...he comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand. 
VALENTINA (looking away) Don't talk to me. 
ANTON P-please...I'm sorry about last night. I behaved like an idiot. 
VALENTINA Yes. 
ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud. Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing. 
ANTON You must admit... even idiots have their qualities. 
CUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes, badly. PARNASSUS and PERCY come up behind him. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS George... We'd like to know who you really are. 
GEORGE What?... Yes. Me too. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS I may be able to help. 
GEORGE Really? What?... How...? 
PERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS.

42   CONTINUED: (2)                                              42 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Hold this piece of wire. 
PERCY You won't feel a thing. 
GEORGE takes the end of the wire. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS I'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head. 
He does so. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) I want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing. 
GEORGE That's not difficult... in my condition. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes. He seems to be making an effort. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Hold your breath. 
GEORGE does so. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I see... I see... Very interesting. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGE'S head and gives the contraption back to PERCY. 
PERCY You may breathe normally. 
The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit down. 
GEORGE What... ? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Alas, this technique has its limitations. 
GEORGE But... Did you discover anything? 
(CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED: (3)                                           42 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (dramatically) Your name. 
GEORGE My name?... What is it? 
PAUSE.

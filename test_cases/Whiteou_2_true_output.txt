TIME CUT TO 
LATER 
A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse. Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm. 
CARRIE You going to be alright? 
DELFY No -- this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life. 
They all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground. 
DOC Gonna give myself a Goddamn hernia. 
They keep pulling and -- SNAP! The arm Doc is holding BREAKS OFF at the elbow. Lands on his ass. 
Delfy turns away and pukes. 
CARRIE Oh yeah -- I'm really going to miss this place. 
CUT TO: 
A SUBJECTIVE POV - THROUGH HIGH POWERED BINOCULARS 
is peering down at them from the top of an ice cliff. 
Widen to see A MAN wearing a white camouflage parka. Lowers the binoculars. Goggles shield his eyes. He moves on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY 
LOUD MUSIC. A party is in progress. People are mingling, some have drinks, others dance. 
The VOLUME of the music dies, replaced by a repetitive SQUEAKING NOISE emanating through the silence. 
People stop what they're doing, and focus on where the noise is coming from, which is -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
-- Doc and Carrie ushering a pushcart with Weiss' contorted, frozen body through the middle of the party. His dismembered arm rests across his chest. 
The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay glued to the horrific state of Weiss' body. 
Just as they pass OPERATIONS, Rhonda steps out with the Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see what's going on. Her eyes immediately go to Weiss, then shift to meet Carrie's. Before she can say anything -- 
CARRIE Who manages the Post Stations? 
RHONDA Dinkle.   Howard Dinkle. 
Doc and Carrie keep moving. Everyone else just keeps silent and watching. Squeaky wheel fades. 
INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY 
CARRIE (O.C.) One - two - three... 
THUMP! Carrie and Doc set Weiss' body onto the examination table. 
CARRIE (cont'd) How long to thaw him out? 
DOC Carrie, let's just bag him and put him on a plane to McMurdo. 
She moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot water from a tap. 
CARRIE It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet. 
DOC Because maybe no one thinks he is. 
CARRIE How'd he get out there?    There were no tracks. 
DOC Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carrie returns with the water.   Goes to pour it on the zipper, but Doc gently puts his hand on hers, stopping her. 
DOC (cont'd) Let's ask ourselves if we really need to do this. 
They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but -- 
CARRIE Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has. 
She slides her hand away from his -- starts pouring the water on the zipper.

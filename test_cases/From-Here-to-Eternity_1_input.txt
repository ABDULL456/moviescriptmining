GENERAL SLATER At ease. Where're you men headed? 
GALOVITCH Top of pass, Sir. This man insubordinate. The Captain is teaching him lesson. 
GENERAL SLATER (FROWNS) What's your outfit, Sergeant? 
GALOVITCH Company G, 219th, Sir. 
The General, still frowning slightly, nods. He signals his driver to move on. The jeep starts down the road. Galovitch gets on his bicycle. Prew starts hiking again. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks 
Prew up and down, half-smiles. 
HOLMES I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now. 
PREW No, sir, I'm not. 
Holmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window. 
HOLMES Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet. 
GALOVITCH (nods unhappily, sick of BICYCLING) Yes, air. 
Prew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G. Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face. 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES Holmes slams his fist on his desk. 
HOLMES 1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! (TO WARDEN) Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer. 
WARDEN Yes, sir. 
Warden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several moments, tries to sound quite casual. 
WARDEN Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that... 
HOLMES Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him? 
WARDEN I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up. 
He looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening. 
WARDEN How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now? 
Holmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him. 
HOLMES All right, all right. But throw the book at him. 
WARDEN (pleased but impassive) Yes, sir. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROCK - NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN SHOOTING INTO SMALL MIRROR He is trimming his moustache. 
WARDEN I'm sick of it! They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid! Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room, undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering, using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks. 
WARDEN I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint! 
KARELSEN Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too, except I can't stand leaving all my old buddies. 
Karelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around his middle. He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden clogs, starts slowly for the door. 
WARDEN Where you going, Little Sir Echo? 
KARELSEN To take my stinkin shower, if the First Sergeant's got no objections. Where'd you think? To the movies in this towel? 
WARDEN (GRINS) Hurry up. Let's go over to Choy's for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs. 
KARELSEN (smiles, moves faster) Okay, Okay. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHOY'S - NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him, DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate. 
GROUP SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE 
STARK ... China's the place. Your money's worth ten, twelves times as much. I'm gunna ship over soon as my time's up in this pineapple Army. 
KARELSEN (pinching beer off his NOSE) The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that. 
WARDEN The last time I heard it you told it different. 
KARELSEN Well, what did you expect? I was in a different mood, then.

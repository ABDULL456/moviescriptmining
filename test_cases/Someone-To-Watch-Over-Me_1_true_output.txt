CLAIRE But "nice". 
MIKE Very nice. 
Her envy is plain. 
MIKE What about Neil? 
CLAIRE You don't like him, do you? 
MIKE (a pause) What's to like? 
CLAIRE (amused) Tell it like it is. 
MIKE You asked. 
CLAIRE He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best. 
MIKE You could do better. 
CLAIRE (laughs) I'll miss you, Mike... 
ANGLE ON BOTH:  the music playing. 
CLAIRE It was nice having you "watch over me"... 
MIKE Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  feeling a moment of awkwardness. 
MIKE Let's go home. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 
The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are seeing.  MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her shoulders. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - NIGHT 
The PATROL CAR comes to a STOP as MIKE and CLAIRE ENTER. 
ANGLE ON THE TWO COPS AGAIN:  watching them go. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
As they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the elevator -- looking at each other.  It comes to a stop, and neither moves; the tension is palpable. 
She steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And in the moment of exchange is the return to reality. 
CLAIRE Good night, Mike. 
MIKE Sleep good. 
She turns to open the door.  Entering she -- and we -- suddenly can see Neil pacing in the hall, b.g.  He's returned.  He looks up, worried and very upset. 
CLOSE ANGLES ON FACES. 
NEIL It's 3 o'clock in the morning. Where the hell have you been? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
MIKE heading down a LONG HALL TOWARD GARBER'S OFFICE: It's like running a gauntlet. 
COP #1 Hey, Mike, tough night. 
KOONTZ I guess it happens, you know?  A chick gives you a ride in her limousine, the next thing she wants is to wear your clothes... (a beat) ... I heard he had her underpants on his head. 
That one got to him; stopped dead by it, he turns, giving KOONTZ a challenging look. 
COP #1 Ease up, Mike.  Ain't nobody gonna tell the old lady. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  cooling down -- then girding himself for GARBER. 
KOONTZ Ain't the first time the taxpayers paid for a blow-job neither.

FADE IN: 
EXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY 
The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the absence of man.  On the screen superimpose: 
MARFA, TEXAS, 1993. 
CREDITS BEGIN. 
A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK, orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the side. 
The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal. 
EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY 
The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS. The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. 
The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go. But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back. He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings, uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before. 
He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He jumps in and heads back onto the plains. 
EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER 
The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides. A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck close.  The latch slams down. 
A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737. 
EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT 
The 737 lands. 
EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER 
One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737 taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times. 
Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show. 
Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT. 
INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT 
The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of stations.  The packages surge and move. 
The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts, where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts. 
The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG. 
EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT 
A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11. 
INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT 
A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board. 
EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
The giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT 
The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX. 
INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small Christmas tree. 
Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down. 
Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes have come to rest. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY 
A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy, the buildings blanketed in snow. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY 
The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward an APARTMENT HOUSE. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The woman puts her arms around him as the door closes. 
RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.) (accented English) It's pretty.  Who is it from? 
AMERICAN MAN (O.S.) My wife.

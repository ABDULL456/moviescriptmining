It is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time. \nJACK I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. \nDAVID Yeah. \nThey are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came.  Although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out of breath. \nDAVID We're lost. \nAnother bloodcurdling howl. \nJACK Shit!  David, what is that? \nDAVID I don't know.  Come on. \nJACK Come on, where? \nDAVID Anywhere!  I think we should just keep moving. \nA growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there.  It starts to walk. \nDAVID It's moving. \nJACK It's circling us. \nAnd indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl. \nJACK Fuck. \nWe hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is - we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It sits breathing heavily. \nDAVID What's the plan? \nJACK (nervously) Plan? \nDAVID (not too relaxed himself) Let's just keep walking. \nThey do and David keeps talking as they walk. \nDAVID That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun? \nThe thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops. \nDAVID It's in front of us. \nJACK Do you think it's a dog? \nJack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them. \nBOYS' P.O.V. \nSomething is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible. \n", "test1_true": "DAVID A sheep dog or something.

Here we are walking away. \nThey are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes flight they stop, panting. \nDAVID See anything? \nJACK No. \nA moment of quiet, then a howl. \nDAVID It sounds far away. \nJACK Not far enough.  Come on. \nThey walk briskly. \nDAVID Jack? \nJACK Yeah. \nDAVID Where are we going? \nJACK I'll tell you when we get there. \nDAVID Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!! \nDavid shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and Jack laugh. \nJACK You really scared me, you shithead. \nDAVID Are you going to help me up? \nJack takes David's extended hand to help him up when THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS! \nEXT. MOORS - NIGHT \nThe lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop. David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams and the wolf's roars combine. \nJACK Jesus fuck!  David!  Please help me!  Please!  David! Shit!  Help me!  Oh God! \nEXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT \nDavid runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath. \nDAVID Jack?  Oh my God, Jack! \nHe gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground.  He stares in horror. \nDAVID Jack.... \nEXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS \nTHE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form rolls off of him. \nEXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT \nDavid, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker, instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers crowd around, David falls back and faints. \nFADE OUT \n", "test1_id": 1689, "test2_input": "Alex begins kissing David's neck. \nDAVID It's all right, I know I'm being insane. \nShe kisses his shoulders, then his chest. \nDAVID Okay, okay.  I'm properly reassured! \nAlex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to hold onto the headboard of the bed. \nDAVID (closing his eyes) This is very reassuring.  I'm feeling very reassured. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes out of the room and goes to the bathroom. \n39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDavid lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway. \nDAVID (points a trembling finger) You're not real. \nJACK Don't be an asshole, David. Come here. \nDavid, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living room. \n40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM \nJack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up Alex. \nDAVID What are you doing here? \nJACK I wanted to see you. \nDAVID Okay, you've seen me.  Now go away. \nJACK David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. \nDAVID I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf. \nJACK Yes. \nDAVID Get out of here, Jack! \nJACK David, tomorrow night is the full moon.  You'll change, you'll become.... \nDAVID (interrupting) A monster.  I know, I know. \nJACK You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late. \nDAVID Jack, are you really dead? \nJACK What do you think? \nDAVID I think I've lost my mind.  I think you're not real.  I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. \nJACK You must believe me. \nDAVID What, Jack?  That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?  Bullshit! \nJACK The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood!  God damit, David, please believe me!  You'll kill and make others like me!  I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again!  You must take your own life! \nDAVID (shouts) I will not accept this!

EAST PROCTOR - DAY \nDr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb. \n44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY \nThe pub is less crowded than when we were here last. The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his gloves: \nDR. HIRSCH A drink for a very cold man? \nThe Woman comes in from the back. \nWOMAN Hello, there.  What can I get you? \nDR. HIRSCH Campari and soda would do nicely. \nWOMAN Sorry, love. \nDR. HIRSCH I suppose Guinness will suffice. \nShe serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money... \nDR. HIRSCH A thousand thanks. \nAfter a few sips. DR. HIRSCH Nasty bit of business with those two young American boys. \nThe Dart Player stops his wiping. \nDART PLAYER I'm afraid I don't know what you mean, sir. \nDR. HIRSCH Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A few weeks ago, the last full moon wasn't it? \nThe Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look at Dr. Hirsch. \nDR. HIRSCH I mean that escaped lunatic. The one that killed the boy. Wasn't that near here? \nCHESS PLAYER (concerned) And where are you from, sir? \nDr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his table. \nDR. HIRSCH London.  Knight takes pawn. \nCHESS PLAYER What? \nSees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game.... \nCHESS PLAYER Oh, yes, yes. \nDr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall. \nDR. HIRSCH What's that? \nWOMAN (nervously) Oh, that's been there for two hundred years.

The tiger paces in its cage and roars again.  We are at: \nEXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY \nIt is early morning and all the animals are aroused. We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is completely naked, his body dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his eyes. \nDAVID Wake me up, Alex. \nHe slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there. He stands up and looks around. \nThe zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes. He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching himself on a thorn. \nDAVID Ouch! \n66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY \nAlex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The phone rings and she runs for it. \nALEX (excited, then disappointed) Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I will, doctor, but I just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing.  Thank you, yes, goodbye. \nShe hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is now more worried than ever. \n67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY \nDavid is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY. \nDAVID Hello. \nCUT TO: \nDOWAGER'S FACE \nDumbfounded. \nDAVID Excuse me, won't you? \nHe returns to the bushes. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING \n", "test3_true": "DAVID (O.S.)

The bush replies: \nDAVID (O.S.) If you come over here, I'll give you a pound. \nThe Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads. \nDAVID (O.S.) Two pounds? \nThe Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons: \nDAVID (O.S.) Listen, two pounds is a lot of money.  It's almost five dollars. \nLITTLE BOY (very English) I don't know who you are. \nDAVID (O.S.) I'm the famous balloon thief. \nLITTLE BOY Why would a thief want to give me two pounds? \nDAVID (O.S.)

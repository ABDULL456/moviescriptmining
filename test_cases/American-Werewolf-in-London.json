{"train": "\"An American Werewolf in London\" -- by John Landis \nFADE IN \n1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT \non the moon. \nEXT. MOON \nCamera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the song \"Moon Shadow\" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is superimposed. \nAn American Werewolf in London \nWe continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it grows farther from us, continuing credits until the full moon is the size it appears to us from earth. \n2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT \nTree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation. \nThe truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER, mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down. \n\"Moon Shadow\" ends. \nCUT TO: \nLoud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe.  They are both in their late twenties. \nIt is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch. \nJACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER \nThey've been cramped for hours. \nTRUCK DRIVER Here, lads, East Proctor and all about are the moors.  I go east here. \nJACK Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir.  You have lovely sheep. \nTRUCK DRIVER (as he clambers back up on his truck) Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the road.  Good luck to you. \nDAVID Thanks again! \nHe drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor. \nEXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT \nAs they walk, their breath visible: \nJACK Are you cold? \nDAVID Yes. \nJACK Good. \nThey walk on, finally: \nDAVID Jack. \nJACK David. \nDAVID You're not having a good time are you? \nJACK Oh, I don't know.  I mean look around.  Isn't this a fun place? \nThe camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding. \nDAVID Well, I like it here. \nJACK I'm sorry.  Northern England first, Italy later. \nDAVID Hello. \nJACK Nice to see you. \nFACES \nSilent and staring. \nCUT TO: \nDAVID AND JACK \nDAVID (smiles) It's very cold outside.  May we come in? \nThe WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over to a table and very self-consciously remove their packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman finally comes over to them. \nJACK Do you have any hot soup? \nWOMAN No. \nDAVID Well, do you have any coffee? \nWOMAN No. \nJACK Hot chocolate? WOMAN We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea. \nJACK Then you have some hot tea? \nWOMAN No. \nJACK Oh. \nWOMAN But I can heat some up for you if you'd like. \nDAVID & JACK Yes, please. \nAs the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess and darts, and the boys breathe easier. \nJACK Nice looking group. \nDAVID Listen, at least it's warm in here. \nJACK Look at that. \nCUT TO: \nJACK'S P.O.V. \nOn the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed star) and on either side burns a yellow candle. \nDAVID What about it? \nJACK It's a five-pointed star. \nDAVID Maybe the owners are from Texas. \nThe Woman brings them their tea. \nJACK (to Woman) Remember the Alamo? \nWOMAN I beg your pardon? \nDAVID He was joking.  Thank you. \nWOMAN Joking?  I remember The Alamo. I saw it once in London, in Leicester Square. \nJack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS explains: \nCHESS PLAYER She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne. (turns to board) Checkmate. \nDAVID Jack, we'd better go. \nJACK What do you mean?  I'm starving. \nDART PLAYER There's no food here. \nThe villagers look threatening and David's voice is a bit urgent. \nDAVID Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! \nJACK Apparently so. \nThe boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door. \nWOMAN (to men) You can't let them go. \nDAVID (worried) How much do we owe you? \nCHESS PLAYER Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you. \nDAVID Uh, thank you. \nWOMAN Wait!  You just can't let them go! \nDART PLAYER Go!  And stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors. \nDAVID Yes, well, thanks again. \nCHESS PLAYER Beware the moon, lads! \nDavid pushes Jack out. \n6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT \nIt is very cold. \nJACK What the hell was that all about? \nDAVID I don't know.  Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. \nJACK Beware the moon? \nDAVID Come on, I'm freezing. \nThey start up the road into the night. \n7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT \nIt is quiet. \nWOMAN You can't let them go. \nDART PLAYER (angry) Should the world know our business?! \nCHESS PLAYER It's murder then. \nDART PLAYER Then murder it is!  It's in God's hands now. \nThe wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK \nwalking on the road surrounded by darkness. \nDAVID That was weird.  I guess leaving was the best idea. \nJACK I don't know.  Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob. \nDAVID A coyote. \nJACK There aren't any coyotes in England. \nDAVID The Hound of the Baskervilles. \nJACK Pecos Bill. \nDAVID Heathcliffe. \nJACK Heathcliffe didn't howl. \nDAVID No, but he was on the moors. \nJACK It's a full moon, `beware the moon'. \nAnother howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time. \nJACK I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. \nDAVID Yeah. \nThey are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came.  Although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out of breath. \nDAVID We're lost. \nAnother bloodcurdling howl. \nJACK Shit!  David, what is that? \nDAVID I don't know.  Come on. \nJACK Come on, where? \nDAVID Anywhere!  I think we should just keep moving. \nA growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there.  It starts to walk. \nDAVID It's moving. \nJACK It's circling us. \nAnd indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl. \nJACK Fuck. \nWe hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is - we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It sits breathing heavily. \nDAVID What's the plan? \nJACK (nervously) Plan? \nDAVID (not too relaxed himself) Let's just keep walking. \nThey do and David keeps talking as they walk. \nDAVID That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun? \nThe thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops. \nDAVID It's in front of us. \nJACK Do you think it's a dog? \nJack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them. \nBOYS' P.O.V. \nSomething is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible. \nDR. HIRSCH Thank you very much, Mr. Collins.  He'll rest now and I'm sure everything will be fine once he's adjusted.  He's had quite a shock. \nMR. COLLINS These dumb-ass kids never appreciate anything you do for them. \nMr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed. \nDAVID How long have I been here? \nDR. HIRSCH You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago. \nDAVID Two weeks? \nDR. HIRSCH You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while.  You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow.  They say a mad man has the strength of ten. \nDAVID (softly, as the drugs take hold) Lunatic? \nDR. HIRSCH Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now.  Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now. \nDr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers. \nDAVID (softly) It wasn't a lunatic. \nALEX (puzzled) I beg your pardon? \nDAVID It was a wolf. \nALEX (bends down close to hear) What? \nDAVID A wolf. \nDavid passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch. DR. HIRSCH Did he say a wolf? \nALEX Yes, I believe he did. \nDr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully. \n14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY \nDr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk calendar. \nDR. HIRSCH But Roger is so terribly boring.  Yes, dear, but couldn't we...I see. (he makes a note) Thursday at eight, dinner with boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I will; if I survived Rommel, I suppose I'll survive another excruciating evening with Roger Mathison.  Be a good girl.  Bye. \nHe hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes. \nDR. HIRSCH Yes? \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor. \nDR. HIRSCH Send them in. \nHe rises to greet the two police officers, one tall, the other rather pudgy. \nLT. VILLIERS Dr. Hirsch? \nDR. HIRSCH Come in, come in.  Please sit. Some tea? \nThe cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a small notebook. \nLT. VILLIERS No, thank you. \nSGT. McMANUS I'd like some tea, please. \nLt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look. \nSGT. McMANUS Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe later. \nDR. HIRSCH It's no problem. \nLT. VILLIERS No, thank you, Doctor. \nAgain the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree. David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements, looking about. \nCLOSEUP \nof his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his animalness. \nDAVID \ntakes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We see him completely as the animal, study his movement and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly he pushes some leaves aside. \nCLOSEUP \nof his eyes. \nDAVID'S P.O.V. \nSeveral deer in the forest; they sense something and freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The buck turns his head, feeling the danger. \nCUT TO: \nDAVID \nShots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing. \nCLOSEUP \nof David's eyes. \nCLOSEUP \nof the frightened deer. \nCUT BACK TO: \nCLOSEUP \nof David's eyes. \nCUT BACK TO: \nTHE FAWN \nas it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame, his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered with blood.  He howls in triumph. \n17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to David, turns on the bed light and touches him. \nMISS GALLAGHER Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please. \nDAVID (awakened) I was having a nightmare. \nMiss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the pills and pouring a glass of water. \nMISS GALLAGHER Yes, well these should help that.  That's right, drink up. \nDavid takes the pills. \nMISS GALLAGHER Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning. \nDAVID What time is it? \nMISS GALLAGHER It's nearly eight.  I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex. \nDAVID Alex? \nMISS GALLAGHER Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you. \nDAVID What are you going to see? \nORDERLY What do you mean, `how did he look'? \nALEX You know, did he seem depressed?  Do you think he'll eat the food? \nORDERLY (annoyed) I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist!  I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them. \nALEX Thank you. \nAlex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room. She hesitates, then peeks in. \n21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nThe curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly. \nALEX (softly) Mr. Kessler? \nDAVID (lifeless) Yes? \nALEX You haven't eaten your lunch. \nDAVID I'm not very hungry, thank you. \nALEX I'm afraid you have to eat something. \nDAVID Please, really.  I'm not hungry. \nALEX You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. \nDAVID How is that? \nALEX (she shakes the paper cup) Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.  Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills? \nDAVID Leave the pills.  I'll take them later. \nALEX Sorry. \nShe opens the curtains, daylight fills the room. \nDAVID Aw come on, Miss Price! \nALEX Call me Alex. \nDAVID Aw come on, Alex! \nALEX Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler? \nDavid is getting interested. \nDAVID Call me David. \nALEX Shall I be forced to feed you, David? \nDAVID This is absurd.  I'm not hungry.  I don't want any food. \nALEX Right. \nAlex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork. David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth. \nALEX Let's try a little harder, shall we? \nDAVID Will you give me a break? \nAlex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly, shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds up another bite. \nALEX Will I have to take such drastic action again, David? \nDavid opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles. She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each other up.  Finally: \nDAVID May I have a glass of milk? \nAlex is relieved for something to break the tension. \nALEX (looking through the book) Let me see here. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \n28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING \nThe black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity. \nORDERLY Ah you're up.  Good morning and a good day to you.  We've quite a meal for you here this morning.  Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam.  Good stuff there.  Now eat it up and I'll be back for the dishes when you've finished. \nThe Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech, notices his exit. \nDAVID Good morning. \nHe looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly. \nDAVID (in mock English accent) Please, sir, I want some more. \nHe settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear Jack's o.s. voice. \nJACK (O.S.) Can I have a piece of toast? \nDavid looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all. \nJACK (pleasantly) Nice to see you. \nDAVID (unbelieving) Get the fuck out of here, Jack. \nJACK Thanks a lot. \nDAVID (horrified) This is too much.  I can't handle this. \nJACK I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. \nJack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at Jack horrified. \nJACK David!  You're hurting my feelings. \nDAVID (astounded) Hurting your feelings?  Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger! \nJACK I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come. \nDAVID (aghast) Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace? \nJACK Yeah.  Your parents came to my funeral.  I was surprised at how many people came. \nDAVID (resigned) Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. \nJACK Debbie Klein cried a lot. \nDAVID I can't stand it. \nJACK So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed. \nDAVID Rudy Levine the shmuck? \nJACK Life mocks me even in death. \nJack takes another bite of toast. \nDAVID (to himself) I'm going completely crazy. \nJACK (loud) David! \nDAVID (louder) What?! \n31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nAlex rushing down hospital corridor. \n32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nJACK Please don't cry. \n33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nAlex rushing to the door. \n34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJACK (softly in looming closeup) Beware the moon, David. \nCUT TO: \nALEX \nas she bursts into the room. \nCUT TO: \nDAVID \nlaying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly. He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David. \nALEX David?  David! \nDavid pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe easier. \nALEX David, what's wrong? \nDavid smiles and kisses her, a real kiss. \nDAVID (quietly) I'm a werewolf. \nALEX A werewolf? \nAlex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little.  David composes himself. \nALEX Are you better now? \nDAVID I'll let you know the next full moon. \nALEX You're to be discharged tomorrow.  Will you be all right? \nDavid takes Alex's hand. \nDAVID My friend Jack was just here. \nALEX Your dead friend Jack? \nDAVID Yeah.  He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think? \nALEX What do I think?  You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends? \nDAVID I was dreaming again? \nALEX I would think so. \nDAVID (resigned) Yeah, I would think so, too. \nAlex considers for a while, finally.... \nALEX Do you have a place to stay in London? \nCUT TO: \nAlex begins kissing David's neck. \nDAVID It's all right, I know I'm being insane. \nShe kisses his shoulders, then his chest. \nDAVID Okay, okay.  I'm properly reassured! \nAlex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to hold onto the headboard of the bed. \nDAVID (closing his eyes) This is very reassuring.  I'm feeling very reassured. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes out of the room and goes to the bathroom. \n39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDavid lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway. \nDAVID (points a trembling finger) You're not real. \nJACK Don't be an asshole, David. Come here. \nDavid, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living room. \n40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM \nJack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up Alex. \nDAVID What are you doing here? \nJACK I wanted to see you. \nDAVID Okay, you've seen me.  Now go away. \nJACK David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. \nDAVID I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf. \nJACK Yes. \nDAVID Get out of here, Jack! \nJACK David, tomorrow night is the full moon.  You'll change, you'll become.... \nDAVID (interrupting) A monster.  I know, I know. \nJACK You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late. \nDAVID Jack, are you really dead? \nJACK What do you think? \nDAVID I think I've lost my mind.  I think you're not real.  I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. \nJACK You must believe me. \nDAVID What, Jack?  That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?  Bullshit! \nJACK The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood!  God damit, David, please believe me!  You'll kill and make others like me!  I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again!  You must take your own life! \nDAVID (shouts) I will not accept this!  Now go away! \n41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlex wakes up from the shouting. \nDR. HIRSCH I see.  You've heard nothing about the incident? \nDART PLAYER Incident? \nDR. HIRSCH The murder? \nCHESS PLAYER Are you a police officer? \nDR. HIRSCH (smiles) No, no, hardly.  I work in the hospital where the Kessler boy was brought. \nThe Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look. \nDR. HIRSCH He was talking about werewolves and monsters and as I was near here I thought.... \nDART PLAYER You thought what? \nDR. HIRSCH I thought I'd look into the boy's story. \nCHESS PLAYER (scoffs) A story about werewolves - now really, sir. \nDr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player. \nDR. HIRSCH Would you like a game of chess? \n45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY \nWe find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door. Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously not going out.  Alex pulls away. \nALEX Let me go now, you'll make me late. \nDAVID Do me an enormous favor? \nALEX Anything. \nDAVID Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive. \nALEX It's silly of you to be apprehensive. \nDAVID Werewolves simply do not exist. \nALEX (serious) David, do you want me to stay here tonight? \nDAVID Yeah, I do, but go to work. \nHe opens the door and they both go outside. \n46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND DAVID \nwalk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly. \nALEX Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay? \nDAVID Okay. \nALEX I've left those pills for you. \nDAVID A doper werewolf. \nThey kiss again. ALEX I'm off.  There's food in the fridge. \nDAVID See you later. \nAlex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl and snarl. \nDAVID (to dog) What did I do? \nThe dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl tugging on his leash. \nDAVID Thanks a lot, dog. \nALEX I thought not. \nShe tucks him in. \nALEX You sleep now and have sweet dreams. \nBENJAMIN & ALEX No! \nFor the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window. \n53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT \nDavid sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain. \nDAVID Jesus Christ! \nHe stands in agony, the book falls to the floor. \nDAVID (screams) What?  Christ!  What? \nHe begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of his head.  He trembles violently. \nDAVID I'm burning up!  Jesus! \nHe rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is dripping wet. \nDAVID (shouts out in pain and fear) Jack!?  Where are you now, you fucker!?! \nAs a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish. \nDAVID Help me!  Somebody help me, please!  Jack!! \nDavid's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at his legs. \nDAVID (pleading, whimpering) I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack. \nNew bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air. \nHe falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. \nThe metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. \nThe camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness. \n54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT \nA taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver and the cab drives off. \nWOMAN Which one, Harry? \nMAN Number thirty-nine, but let's go `round the back. \nWOMAN Why? \nMAN Come on, we'll give Sean a scare. \nWOMAN You're crazy, Harry. \nHARRY Come on. \nHarry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and quiet. \n55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT \nWOMAN Did you hear something? \nHARRY Just now? \nWOMAN Yes. \nrings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring unanswered. \n62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nDr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up. \nDR. HIRSCH He's not there. \nAlex grows worried. \nALEX He's not? \nDR. HIRSCH Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies? \nALEX Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend. \nDR. HIRSCH Has his friend appeared to him again? \nALEX Yes. \nDR. HIRSCH What did he say? \nALEX David says Jack comes to warn him. \nDR. HIRSCH Warn him? \nALEX Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is this more serious than I know? \nDR. HIRSCH I tried to investigate the attack.  There are no records. The case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did.  The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us.  So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things. \nALEX Yes. \nDR. HIRSCH They were lying.  There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic.  The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there. \nALEX And what else? \nDR. HIRSCH I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret.  I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf. \nAlex is flabbergasted. \nDR. HIRSCH You've absolutely no idea where David might be? \nALEX No.  He knows no one in London, besides me.  I shouldn't have left him alone. \nSuddenly. \nALEX Surely you're not suggesting.... \nDR. HIRSCH David has suffered a severe trauma.  I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor.  If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? \nALEX (bewildered) Dr. Hirsch? \nDR. HIRSCH Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon.  But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others. \nALEX What shall we do? \nDR. HIRSCH Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy. \n63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT \nThe bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its ears perk up and he growls in warning. \nDERELICT #1 Old Winston smells something. \nDERELICT #2 (calls out) Who's there? \nThe dog begins to whine. \nDERELICT #2 Let `im go. \nPASSENGER I shall report this! \nPASSENGER'S P.O.V. \nWe see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the tunnel towards us. \nPASSENGER Good Lord. \nTHE PASSENGER \nturns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is terrified. \nWOLF - CLOSEUP \nof the Wolf's running steps. \nTHE PASSENGER \nfrantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear. Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and defeated, the blood trickling from his nose. \nCUT TO: WOLF'S P.O.V. \nas it begins to climb the stairs.  The camera tracks slowly in on the increasingly horrified Passenger until we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes, when we: \nCUT TO: \n65   CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING \n(A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars again.  We are at: \nEXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY \nIt is early morning and all the animals are aroused. We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is completely naked, his body dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his eyes. \nDAVID Wake me up, Alex. \nHe slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there. He stands up and looks around. \nThe zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes. He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching himself on a thorn. \nDAVID Ouch! \n66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY \nAlex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The phone rings and she runs for it. \nALEX (excited, then disappointed) Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I will, doctor, but I just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing.  Thank you, yes, goodbye. \nShe hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is now more worried than ever. \n67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY \nDavid is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY. \nDAVID Hello. \nCUT TO: \nDOWAGER'S FACE \nDumbfounded. \nDAVID Excuse me, won't you? \nHe returns to the bushes. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING \nDR. HIRSCH I'll have one of those, too. \nHe pays for the papers.  The second one's headline, \"Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?\" \n71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP \nin another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks at him oddly. \nDAVID (cheerfully) A lot of weather we've been having lately. \nThe man studies David carefully. \n72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY \nAlex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading. There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to open it and David enters quickly, closing the door behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat. \nALEX David!  Where on earth have you been!?! \nDAVID I'm freezing. \nHe goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is excited, even euphoric. \nDAVID Alex, I've lost my mind.  I woke up at the zoo!  But you know what?  I feel terrific! \nALEX The zoo? \nDAVID Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane.  Having no clothes on?  That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? \nALEX Don't you remember? \nDAVID I said goodbye to you.  I was locked out of the flat.  I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! (big smile) I guess I am out of my fucking mind. \nAlex sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders. \nALEX I worried about you.  We didn't know where you were. \nDavid kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back with equal passion. \nALEX Where did you get that coat? \nDavid laughs. \n73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE \nDr. Hirsch is dialing the phone. \n74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT \nThe phone rings. \nALEX I'll get it. \nAlex goes to the phone. \nALEX Hello? \nThe telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and Dr. Hirsch. \nDR. HIRSCH Alex, have you heard anything? \nAlex speaks softly so that David won't hear her. ALEX He's here. \nDR. HIRSCH (excited) Is he all right?  Why didn't you call me?  Where was he? \nALEX He doesn't remember.  He woke up at the zoo. \nDR. HIRSCH The zoo?  Is he rational? \nALEX Yes, he is.  He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean. \nDAVID Pull over. \nALEX But.... \nDAVID (adamant) Pull over. \n77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY \nThe cab pulls to the sidewalk. \nDAVID Pay the man. \nDavid gets out of the cab. \nALEX David, wait! \nShe hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off after David. \nALEX David, what are you doing? \nDAVID Six people mutilated?  It had to be me, Alex. \nALEX David, stop! \nHe turns and faces her. \nDAVID I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right.  I.... \nALEX (angry) Jack is dead! \nDAVID Jack is dead.  Look, six people have been killed.  I'm going to the police. \nDavid takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex has to jog to keep up with him. \nALEX David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. \nDAVID Rational!?!  I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! \nHe strides up to a Bobbie on the corner. \nDAVID Officer, I killed those people last night. \nBOBBIE (interested) You did, did you? \nAlex runs up. \nALEX He's playing a stupid joke, sir. \nDAVID (dumbfounded) What? \nALEX We had an argument.  He's being silly. \nDAVID (desperate) I swear, I don't know this girl. \nBOBBIE All right, you two, move along. \nDAVID Hey, you asshole!  I want you to arrest me! \nBOBBIE There's no call for that kind of language. \nDAVID (shouts) Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! \nBOBBIE (losing patience) Now see here young man. \nDAVID Shakespeare was French!  The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss! \nThe Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians start to gather. \nBOBBIE That's quite enough! \nLT. VILLIERS (harried) Gentlemen, please.  We shall find Mr. Kessler as quickly as we're able. \nALEX He tried to have himself arrested.  He.... \nLT. VILLIERS (interrupts) Getting arrested isn't all that difficult, Miss Price. \nALEX He wants help.  He.... \nDR. HIRSCH (interrupts) What can we do to assist you? \nLT. VILLIERS (rising) Stay here.  If we need you, we'll know where to reach you. \nHe and Sgt. McManus pause by the door. \nLT. VILLIERS I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders.  We will find him, however.  I can assure you of that. \nSGT. McMANUS We'll find him, not to worry. \nThe two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex. \nALEX (distraught) What shall we do? \nDR. HIRSCH (comforting) Tea would be nice. \n80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY \nDavid is in a telephone booth. \nDAVID Yes, operator.  I'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges.  David Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code 315/472-3402.  Thank you. (pause) Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom or Dad home?  Where are they? Where's Max?  You're all alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London.  I'm all better.  Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try.  Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them.  I love Max and you, too.  Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep.  You promise? Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love you.  Bye. \nHe hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then catches sight of something. \n81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V. \nThere stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles, walks across the intersection, and up to the box office. \nTICKET LADY Two and a half quid, please. \nDavid reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's checks. \nDAVID Will you take a traveler's check? \nTICKET LADY No, sorry. \nDavid signs a $100 check and hands it to her. \nDAVID Keep the change. \nTICKET LADY Well, thank you, sir! \nShe gives him a ticket.  David goes in. \n82   INT. CINEMA - DAY \nA film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide- eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David goes and sits next to him. \nDAVID Hi, Jack. \nJACK Hi, David. \nThey sit for a while watching the screen. \nDAVID What can I say, Jack? \nJACK You don't have to say anything. \nDAVID Aren't you going to say, `I told you so'? \nJACK If I was still alive, I probably would. \n", "test1_input": "FADE IN \n11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nDavid is in a small, clean and very white hospital room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma. There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls out.... \nDAVID Jack?! \n...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very beautiful.  She goes to the bed. \nALEX Mr. Kessler? \nShe looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed. \nALEX Mr. Kessler? \nDavid remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS GALLAGHER, comes in. \nMISS GALLAGHER He all right? \nALEX Yes, I should think.  He called out just now. \nMISS GALLAGHER He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him. \nALEX Chart says he's from New York. \nMISS GALLAGHER I think he's a Jew. \nALEX Why on earth do you say that? \nMISS GALLAGHER I looked. \nALEX (smiles) Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now. \nA voice startles the girls. \nDR. HIRSCH Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right. \nDR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring presence.  The girls are embarrassed. \nALEX Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. \nDR. HIRSCH Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. \nMISS GALLAGHER Yes, Doctor. \nDR. HIRSCH Then get on with it. \nMISS GALLAGHER Yes, Doctor. \nShe exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex. \nDR. HIRSCH Can I be of service, Miss Price? \nALEX Dr. Hirsch? \nDR. HIRSCH Go about your duties. \nALEX Yes, Doctor. \nShe starts to exit. \nDR. HIRSCH Oh, Miss Price? \nALEX Yes, Doctor? \nDR. HIRSCH What exactly did he call out? \nALEX He said `Jack'. \n", "test1_true": "ALEX What happened to them? \nDR. HIRSCH The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man.  Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price. \nALEX No, sir.  Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor. \nShe exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination, looking into David's eyes. \n12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY \nThe camera is handheld, running furiously through the almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about, the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and harder, then too loud when we: \nCUT TO: \n13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nDavid opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr. Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase. \nDR. HIRSCH Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins. \nDAVID Where am I? \nDR. HIRSCH You're in a hospital in London. \nDAVID London?  Where's Jack?  I had a strange dream. \nDR. HIRSCH I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences. \nDAVID The guy I was with.  Is he all right?  How did I get to London? \nDR. HIRSCH (quietly) Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead. David jolts up in bed and shouts. \nDAVID What? \nThe sudden exertion and strain hurt. \nDAVID Ow, shit! \nHe sinks back down. \nDAVID Jack's dead? \nMR. COLLINS Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins of the American Embassy here in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr. Goodman's parents and your parents have been notified of your injuries and everything's in order. \nDAVID Everything's in order?  What are you talking about? \nMR. COLLINS Mr. Goodman's body has been air-freighted back to New York for burial and your parents have wired funds for your stay in the hospital until you are well enough to fly home. \nDAVID (controlled tears) You don't crate and ship Jack like some side of beef. (approaching hysteria) Who the hell are you people? What's going on here?  Where is Jack?  I demand to see him! \nDR. HIRSCH (holds David down, calls out) Miss Price!  Miss Price, please! \nDAVID (shouting) Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? \nAlex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion. \nMR. COLLINS (distraught, clutching his briefcase) I realize how upsetting this must be for you, Mr. Kessler, but please try to refrain from hysterics. \nDavid continues shouting and struggling. \nDR. HIRSCH Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss Price. \nThe shot is administered and David is held down by Dr. Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more normal. \nMR. COLLINS Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to excite yourself.  Everything has been arranged.  I shall come back to check on your progress and send a report to your parents.  The police have requested to interview you and I have given them permission to do so. \nDr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door. \n", "test2_input": "DAVID Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me?  You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. DR. HIRSCH (rubs his forehead) David, please.  The police are satisfied.  I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly. \nDAVID You really think I'm crazy, don't you? \nDR. HIRSCH Believe me.  The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake. \nThere is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr. Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice. \nDR. HIRSCH Now really, David.  You're far too intelligent to go on this way.  When you return to America I want you to seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop this nonsense.  You'll be leaving this hospital in three or four days, please remain sane.  At least until you are no longer our responsibility. \nDr. Hirsch goes to the door. \nDAVID Dr. Hirsch? (pause) I'd rather not be by myself. \nDR. HIRSCH Of course not, David.  I'll fetch in young Miss Price. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAlex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair. The room is dark except for the lamp by which she reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns. She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and feet, fingers and toes stretch. \nDAVID (quietly) You're a very beautiful girl. \nALEX (embarrassed) I thought you were asleep. \nDAVID I was.  What are you reading? \nALEX `A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain. \nDAVID Do you like it? \nALEX I've just started it.  My friend gave it to me. \nThey look at each other. \nALEX What do you dream about? \nDAVID I dream of death mostly. \nALEX I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have asked you. \nDAVID It's okay.  I want to talk to you. \nThey sit and look at each other for a while longer. \nDAVID How old are you? \nALEX That's not really a very proper question. \nDAVID How old are you? \nALEX Twenty-eight. \nDAVID I'm twenty-seven. \nALEX I know. \nDAVID Now what do you want to talk about? \nALEX Was Jack Goodman your good friend? \nDAVID (seriously) My best friend.  My very best friend. \nALEX (embarrassed) Shall I read to you? \nDAVID What?  Oh, yes, please. \nALEX (opens book) A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens.  This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right? \n", "test2_true": "ALEX (clears her throat) Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about.  He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking.  We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd.... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT \nWe are at David's parents' house in New York.  His FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger BROTHER and SISTER watch \"The Muppet Show\" on television.  We can see past the small dining nook where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door. \nFATHER I'll get it. \nThe pounding continues. \nFATHER All right, all right!  Hold your horses. \n(The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he opens the door, four beings open fire with machine guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not human at all, but loathsome, bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into his chair by one of the things and held there. \nDAVID Stop! \nHe watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered. The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly slits David's throat. \nCUT TO: \n27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nDavid bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up anyway. \nALEX (yawns, smiles) Hello.  You all right? \nDAVID I'm sorry I woke you up. \nALEX Don't be silly.  Can I get you something? \nDAVID No, thank you.  Just keep me company for a while. \nALEX That's easy enough. \nDAVID I keep having these really terrible dreams.  They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them. \nALEX David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away. \nDAVID Will you come with me? \nALEX (taken aback) What? \nDAVID (smiling) I'm serious.  You don't know me and I know nothing about you.  We have a perfect relationship. \nALEX Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now. \nDAVID Will you think about it? \nALEX How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient? \nDAVID (big grin) Not just a patient -- me. \nALEX You're being awfully forward, aren't you? \nDAVID Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it. \nALEX (smiles) All I am to you is a sex fantasy then? \nDAVID Now I'm embarrassed. \nALEX Good.  I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room. \nThere is an awkward pause. \nDAVID Where were we in the book? \n", "test3_input": "DERELICT #3 So what?

I've gone totally mad. \nHARRY A gun is good. \nJUDITH You just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger. \nBRINGSLY If you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss. \nDAVID Thank you, you're all so thoughtful. \nAs the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head suddenly. \nCUT TO: \n83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT \nThe clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up. \n84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT \nDavid is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him. \nDAVID (gasps out in anguish) Go away!  Please!  Go away! \nThe children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow more severe. \nDAVID (his face contorting) Run!  Please...run. \nHis hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in fascination. \n85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT \nRoars and screams come from inside the theater.

The movie continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror. \nTHE WOLF SPRINGS! \nCUT TO: \n87   EXT.

The Wolf turns, eyes blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce, burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop. The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him. \n90   EXT. CINEMA \nAs the cop bolts the door shut. \nCOP #1 For God's sake, Tom, there's a monster in there!

Mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf. \nIt runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly barricade the entrance to the alley. \n94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT \nThe taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester Square.

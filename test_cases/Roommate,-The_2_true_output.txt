Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She stumbles out into the... 
HALLWAY. She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen. We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and switches on the light. 
We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the glass again. Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to go back to her room ...WHAM!! Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene. 
CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR 
EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING 
Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old art deco apartment building. 
INT. LOBBY - MORNING 
Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No answer. 
EXT. STREET - MORNING 
She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - MORNING 
Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the door. 
INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING 
She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up when she sees Sara. 
REBECCA Hey! 
SARA Hey yourself. Where were you all night? 
REBECCA Oh, I got inspired. I just lost track of time. Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper, grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her tattoo. Sara grabs a robe. A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca. 
SARA 
REBECCA -- 
REBECCA I want a tattoo. 
(SARA'S SHOCKED) Will you come with me? 
SARA Uhhh... 
REBECCA Please. It would mean a lot to me. I won't be able to do it without you. Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them. 
SARA Um... sure. Okay. 
INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY 
The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples. 
SARA You can't rush this, Rebecca. We can always come back. 
REBECCA I know what I want. 
SARA Okay. I'm out here if you need me. Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs. She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone, Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene. 
INT. TATTOO PARLOR - LATER 
Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene: "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )" Sara's relieved. 
STAIRS Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.

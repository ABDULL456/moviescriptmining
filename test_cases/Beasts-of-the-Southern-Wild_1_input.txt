The Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking exhausted and starved. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals got no mercy. 
Cold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going to make it. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies. 
CUT TO: 
The Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore. 
The CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another, sound, more MECHANICAL... 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING 
The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER. 
Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm. Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship. 
She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with. 
EVACUATOR (O.S.) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave. 
Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter. 
WINK We ain't going nowhere! 
Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff. 
INT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING 
Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house. 
Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol. 
LITTLE JO You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going. 
EVACUATOR 2 Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you. 
LITTLE JO I ain't never left here and I won't never will. 
She spits. They get closer. 
LITTLE JO (CONT'D) Son, don't make me cancel your birth certificate. 
The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground. It's horrible. 
EVACUATOR 2 Relax, relax ma'am. 
LITTLE JO YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
They drag Little Jo out of the house. 
INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING 
MATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out.

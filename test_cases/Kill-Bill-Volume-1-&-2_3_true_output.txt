Yuki leaps on her with the knife... 
They struggle for a moment... 
...TILL... 
...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the side. 
THE BRIDE Goddamn, what a wildcat. 
INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT 
The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone. 
NURSE OWENS Hello. 
CU The Bride on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood planks. The moon shines into the structure. 
THE BRIDE Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens -- 
NURSE OWENS Who is this. 
THE BRIDE You don't know me, but -- 
NURSE OWENS -- And I don't want to neither. Now 
I don't know how you got my number, but you can just rip that shit up, because -- 
THE BRIDE -- I've been shot five times -- 
NURSE OWENS -- Stop, I don't wanna hear no more. I got problems of my own. 
THE BRIDE I'm dying. 
NURSE OWENS Then bitch, you better call yourself a ambulance, cause I don't do this shit no more. 
THE BRIDE I can't call an ambulance. 
NURSE OWENS --    No, you can call a ambulance, you    just don't want to. But if your ass    is really dying, you ain't got no    motherfuckin choice. 
THE BRIDE I do have a choice, and I'm choosing to call you. If you refuse to help me, I'll die. And that will be your choice. 
NURSE OWENS Bitch, I don't even know you! 
THE BRIDE What do you need to know? I'm from Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and only you can help me. 
Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse. 
NURSE OWENS Okay, where you at? 
THE BRIDE I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a kids treehouse. It's a street called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick Avenue. There's a bunch of police cars and firetrucks, about two blocks away. 
NURSE OWENS Whatcha do, crawl two blocks? 
THE BRIDE If you can't walk, you better crawl. 
Nurse Owens likes that last line. 
NURSE OWENS You got you some money dontcha, or am I doin this out of the goodness of my heart? 
THE BRIDE You come and get me, today's pay day. 
NURSE OWENS You ain't too far away. You gonna bleed to death I get there in a half a hour? 
THE BRIDE Probably. 
NURSE OWENS Okay, I'll be there in fifteen minutes. 
THE BRIDE Is that Pacific Standard Time, or C.P.T.? 
NURSE OWENS Just you better be there    when I get there, and you better be    shot five times, and your bony ass    better be on your last motherfuckin    legs. 
THE BRIDE How do you know I have a bony ass? 
NURSE OWENS You sound like you have a bony ass. 
The Nurse hangs up the phone. 
INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT 
The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens. 
Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor. 
THE BRIDE Glad you made it. 
NURSE OWENS There's cops all over here, I had to be cool. They tend to notice things like Negroes sneaking around people's backyards. 
The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey. 
THE BRIDE What's that? 
NURSE OWENS This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't got no anesthetic. 
(refers to the bottle) So git busy. 
INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
OVERHEAD SHOT The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the nurse extracts the bullets. 
The Bride screams. 
The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams. 
The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three cigarette butts and other balls of lead. 
The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior; 
THE BRIDE That fuckin smarts. 
Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says; 
NURSE OWENS Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the future, you should avoid them if you can. 
THE BRIDE I'll keep that in mind. So, do I have a future? 
NURSE OWENS You'll live to kill again. 
THE BRIDE Splendid. 
She passes out. 
FADE TO BLACK.

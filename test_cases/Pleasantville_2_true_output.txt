MARGARET Real rain? 
DAVID Yeah ... You don't have rain either? 
She looks at him frightened. David smiles. 
DAVID (CONT) Right. Of course you don't ... 
He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank, looking in terror at the water falling from the sky. 
MARGARET What do we do? 
DAVID (reaching the car) We'll just put up the top. 
He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder. 
MARGARET What top? 
He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to shiver. 
DAVID It's fine. Come on. 
He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together. They look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock. 
DAVID (CONT) It's alright. There's nothing to be afraid of. 
They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm howls a few feet away ... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT. 
She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain. Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand. There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of thunder. 
JENNIFER Cool ... 
She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ... 
PARKER LIVING ROOM. 
George wanders through the empty and darkened house completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms and the sound of the driving storm. 
GEORGE (a little frightened/ a little petulant) Honey, I'm home ... 
He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM. The lights are dark there as well and he looks around confused. 
GEORGE (CONT) (baffled) Where's my dinner? 
He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's empty as well. 
KITCHEN. 
He crosses into the darkness ... 
GEORGE Where's my dinner ... 
INT. FOYER. 
George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ... 
GEORGE (insistent) Where's my DINNER ... 
EXT. HOUSE. 
It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still dressed in his shirtsleeves. 
GEORGE Where's my DINNER! 
ON GEORGE. 
He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin. 
GEORGE (over the storm) WHERE'S MY DINNER ... 
EXT. ELM STREET. 
A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming skyward in the distance. 
GEORGE ... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY DINNER! 
SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ... 
He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ... Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain. George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ... 
GEORGE (plaintively) Where's my dinner? 
He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk. 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT. 
The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt, sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses. 
The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ... 
ANGLE. BIG BOB. 
He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up and suddenly stops. 
REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. 
George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His hair is drenched and dripping. 
BOB What happened? 
He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps shivering. 
WIDER. 
The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a couple of times, still soaked to the bone. 
BOB Are you alright? (looking at him) What is it?

Congratulations. 
BRANDON I'm picking now with you and Jerry. 
CHUCK (ducking back into his office) 
Whatever. 
The MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT sign.  SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange. 
SOUTHIE Don't take it personal.  Chuck's got a condition, get's anxious around people. 
CHUCK closes his blinds, blocks out his glassed-in walls and-- 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY 
BRANDON'S poring over sports pages and injury reports when TAMMY enters his office, sits on his desk, extends a lead sheet. 
TAMMY His name's Amir, he's a dime bettor.  Owns a dry cleaners.  We got him for the subscription.  He's on line three. 
(leans in, gives BRANDON a kiss) 
TAMMY Walter wanted your first call to be special.  Go get 'em tiger. 
BRANDON (picking up) 
Amir, my man, John Anthony here! 
INT. NEW JERSEY DRY CLEANER - DAY 
A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (ratty t-shirt, beard stubble, sleepless look) stands in the back of a low-end dry cleaners. 
AMIR Yes, hello. 
BRANDON Today's your day, Amir!  It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend!  Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life!  How much can you lay with your bookie?  20 large? 
Amir 
You crazy?  No way.  I was betting a thousand a game but... Look, I saw an ad.  I was just calling to see-- 
BRANDON --Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime!  Texas plus the six points! They win by two touchdowns! 
Amir 
Really?  I like Oklahoma in that game. 
BRANDON (looks up, sees WALTER watching) 
Oklahoma huh?  Okay... well considering that, I like Texas even more now. 
Amir 
I shouldn't have called.  Thank you for-- 
BRANDON --Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life. 
WALTER crosses, whispers to BRANDON.  Into the phone: 
BRANDON Hold on, I got Vegas on the line. 
(pressing HOLD) 
WALTER There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole.  The second they pick up the phone, wham!  Right to the point!  You're above them!  Let 'em feel it!  More confidence!  More John Anthony! 
(punches speaker phone) 
BRANDON/into phone 
Amir, what's your favorite drink? 
AMIR Favorite drink?  I dunno, Pina Colada. 
BRANDON Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink.  But for now, this is what you're gonna do.  First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a 
Hawaiian shirt, whip up your sweet little rum concoction with the orange slice and 
the cherry, turn on the game and play 
with the little umbrella while you sit 
back and watch Texas tear those Okies a 
new asshole -- and when you call me back 
after winning 20 G's the first thing out out of your mouth will be words every fratboy knows -- "Thank you, sir, may I have another!" 
AMIR ... What about payment? 
BRANDON Good question.  What about it? 
Amir 
Well how much is this going to cost me? 
BRANDON We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it?

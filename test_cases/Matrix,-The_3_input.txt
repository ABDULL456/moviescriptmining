INT.  DOJO 
They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo. 
MORPHEUS This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.  Consider this your first lesson. 
He assumes a fighting stance. 
MORPHEUS Attack me. 
Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack. 
It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack 
But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed. 
INT.  MAIN DECK 
While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive chairs. 
Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and steady rhythm of Morpheus. 
INT.  MESS HALL 
Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency. 
MOUSE bursts in the room. 
MOUSE Morpheus is fighting Neo! 
All at once they bolt for the door. 
INT.  DOJO 
Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls himself at Morpheus. 
MORPHEUS Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique. 
Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until -- 
Neo falls. 
Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo. 
MORPHEUS How did I beat you? 
NEO You -- You're too fast. 
MORPHEUS Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? 
Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath. 
MORPHEUS Do you believe that's air you are breathing now? 
Neo squints at him. 
MORPHEUS If you can free your mind, the body will follow. 
Neo stands, nodding. 
MORPHEUS Again. 
Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed. 
INT.  MAIN DECK 
Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight, like watching a game of Mortal Combat. 
CABLE Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast! 
MOUSE You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank? 
TANK Never. 
APOC Morpheus is right.  He's got to be the one. 
INT.  DOJO 
The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm with a scream. 
He wants to beat Morpheus bad. 
Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the head, knocking his glasses off. 
INT.  MAIN DECK 
There are several gasps. 
MOUSE I don't believe it! 
INT.  DOJO 
Morpheus rubs his face. 
MORPHEUS You are angry with me. 
Neo pants. 
NEO I, uh... maybe. 
MORPHEUS It's all right.  It's natural. 
NEO I feel better.

Suzanne shakes her head "no." Bob points to her, as if she's strengthening his point. 
JAY (to Suzanne) You stay out of this, you weepy little chimp! (looks around thinking) Fuck man, I ain't no strategist! You're the guy that makes the blueprints! I don't even have the fucking smarts of a little-- 
Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball cap. 
JAY --kid 
EXT. DINER--DAY 
Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The Sheriff looks on. 
WILLENHOLLY ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO OPEN FIRE! (to cops) Everyone has bullets in their guns, right? 
Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face. It's a pretty piss-poor disguise. 
JAY Don't shoot! We're just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment! 
From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly. 
SHERIFF Their "son"? 
WILLENHOLLY Maybe they're one of those gay couples? 
Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently. 
JAY Yeah! We're gay! And this is our adopted love child! We're not from around here!  Don't make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah! (whispers to Bob) You see the shit I gotta put up with for you! Now I got this guy thinking I'm gay! 
WILLENHOLLY Oh God, this is the last thing I need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal press that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes gays. 
SHERIFF ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON! THAT'S THE APE! 
WILLENHOLLY You see this badge?  I think I'd recognize an ape if I saw one. And the only thing I do recognize here is a political fiasco I'm, going to avoid by letting this butt-fucking Brady Bunch go! 
Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by-- 
JAY And I'll tell you another thing: what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you and me are poo-gilists? How are we gonna get any pussy then, hunh? 
WILLENHOLLY (V.O.) YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS! 
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at himself, as if to say, "Me?" 
WILLENHOLLY (via bullhorn) YES, YOU, SIRS. 
JAY (calling over) So we can just go? 
WILLENHOLLY (via bullhorn) Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my apologies for detaining you and your unorthodox-but-constitutionally- protected-family unit. 
SHERIFF (amazed) Un-fucking believable. 
JAY I'd like to offer a big gay thank- you, sir. We'll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for gays who are gay. 
WILLENHOLLY I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You might also want to make it clear that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office is also pro-'mo as well. (winks at the sheriff) And might I add, that's one fine- looking boy you're raising. 
JAY Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm. See, I knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who I also fuck on the side. So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer. He loves the cock. 
WILLENHOLLY He certainly looks insatiable. 
JAY 'Bye 
WILLENHOLLY 'Bye 
Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road. Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid. 
WILLENHOLLY Well, it's not my way--but damned if there doesn't go one happy family. (balloon two) Now, we just shoot some tear gas into that diner, and when the two guys run out with the monkey, we'll-- 
Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the Sheriff. 
WILLENHOLLY That was the them, wasn't it? 
EXT. ROAD--DAY 
Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing. 
JAY I said you "love the cock"! I gotta be the craftiest motherfucker alive! 
GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now in full panic mode. 
Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

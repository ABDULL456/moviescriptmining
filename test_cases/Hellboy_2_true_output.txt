HELLBOY (realizing) Father's back? (Clay nods) Still angry? 
CLAY Well, you did break out -- 
HELLBOY I wanted to see her. (grunts) It's nobody's business. 
CLAY It is. You got yourself on TV again. 
HELLBOY "Myers", huh? You have a first name?? 
CLAY (sotto to Myers) Try not to stare. He hates when people stare. 
MYERS Uh-oh -- John. (sotto) Staring at what? 
CLAY His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in." 
MYERS His what??!! 
Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils. 
In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps. 
HELLBOY Whatcha looking at, John?? 
MYERS Oh-n-no -- I -- 
An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers looks around, bewildered. 
HELLBOY (to Clay) Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song. 
CLAY We're on the move. 
HELLBOY (to Myers) C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT 
An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER. 
Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN 
Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED POLICE. 
Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan cars are waved through. 
BLONDE REPORTER The NYPD has yet to issue a statement. We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you name it...  and now here's -- a garbage truck -- (double take) -- a garbage truck? 
Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management Services. 
INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side. 
EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck. 
INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT 
The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans. 
ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. 
Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD. 
HELLBOY Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us. 
ABE Story of my life. 
HELLBOY I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. (nostalgic) Outside. I could be outside -- 
ABE You mean, outside... with her. 
Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch. 
HELLBOY Don't get psychic with me. 
ABE Nothing psychic about it. You're easy. 
Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable cannon. 
HELLBOY How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck 
ABE Liz left us, Red. Take the hint. 
HELLBOY (hefting the gun) We don't take hints.

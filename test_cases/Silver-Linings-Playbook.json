Are you any good at that? \nTIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. \nINT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY \nDR. PATEL You seemed to have trouble last night. \nPAT Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean.... \nDR. PATEL He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well. \nPAT Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best. \nDR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can. \nPAT Yeah, but that's easier said than done. \nDR. PATEL You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior. \nPAT Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? \nDR. PATEL No. \nPAT Why? \nDR. PATEL Because you have a restraining order. \nPAT \n(SIGHS) What good are you, man? \nDR. PATEL Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night? \nPAT Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months? \nDR. PATEL Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you? \nPAT Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut. \nDR. PATEL Why is she a slut? \nPAT After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, \"We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out.\" Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut. \nDR. PATEL Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her. \nPAT She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same? \nDR. PATEL Can you? \nPAT Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question? \nDR. PATEL Yes. \nPAT With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? \nDR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This \"crazy sad shit,\" as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books. \nPAT No, not the books. \nTIFFANY And the so-called incident with the weights. \nPAT Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well. \nTIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT. \nTIFFANY I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister. \nPAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING. \nPAT It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me. \nTIFFANY I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing. \nPAT But you would do it? \nTIFFANY I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job. \nPAT How did you lose your job? \nTIFFANY By...having sex with everybody in the office. \nPAT Everybody? \nTIFFANY I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people. \nPAT We don't have to talk about it. \nTIFFANY Thanks. \nPAT How many were there? \nTIFFANY Eleven. \nPAT Wow. \nTIFFANY I know. \nPAT I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. \nTIFFANY Okay. \nPAT Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women? \nTIFFANY Yes. \nPAT Really? \nTIFFANY Yes. \nPAT What was that like? \nTIFFANY Hot. \nPAT Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to \nSEDUCE YOU-- \nTIFFANY Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah. \nPAT What? You sat on her lap? \nTIFFANY Mm-hmm. \nPAT She told you what to do? \nTIFFANY Mm-hmm. \nPAT Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject. \nTIFFANY I don't mind it. \nPAT You don't, do you. \nTIFFANY No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. \nPAT I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher... \nTIFFANY I heard about that. \nPAT ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing. \nTIFFANY Wow. \nPAT Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of. \nTIFFANY Yeah. \nPAT So I know. \nTIFFANY You do. \nPAT I just gotta get a strategy, you know? \nTIFFANY Me too. \nPAT We'd better get back to the letter. \nTIFFANY Yeah, let's get back to the letter. \nPAT What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom? \nTIFFANY Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that. \nPAT Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now. \nPAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH. \nTIFFANY Can I at least finish my tea? \nPAT Wait, what? \nTIFFANY My tea. Can I finish it? \nPAT Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test? \nTIFFANY I kinda got that feeling, yeah. \nPAT Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well. \nTIFFANY Yeah, she said you were cool, basically. \nPAT \"Basically\"? Was I some percentage not cool? \nTIFFANY No, she said you were cool, but you know. \nPAT No, I don't know. \nTIFFANY Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax. \nCAMERA PANS WITH OFFICER KEOGH AS HE WALKS TO PAT, GRABS HIS \nARM. \nOFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do? \nPAT I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens. \nTIFFANY It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back. \nOFFICER KEOGH (walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here. \nAS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented. \nTIFFANY You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face. \nTIFFANY (CONT'D) There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his. \nTIFFANY (CONT'D) That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \nPAT I'm sorry. \nTIFFANY I took it too far. \nPAT I'm sorry. \nOFFICER KEOGH (pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you? \nTIFFANY No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started. \nOFFICER KEOGH There's a restraining order on this guy. \nTIFFANY I know, I have a stupid sense of humor. \nOFFICER KEOGH That's not a good thing to do. \nTIFFANY Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry. \nOFFICER KEOGH You're Tommy's widow, right? \nTIFFANY Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part. \nOFFICER KEOGH You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? \nTIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY. \nOFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) What'd I say? \nPAT She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore. \nEXT.

TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go. \nPAT Wow.

I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope. \nPAT SR. You didn't want to wake me? (to Dolores and Randy) He didn't want to wake me.

When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up! \nPAT Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, \nI-- \nPAT SR. Who is this? What is this? \nTIFFANY Oh, really? \nPAT Yes. \nPAT (CONT'D) I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie-- \nTIFFANY Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. \nPAT SR. What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell? \nPAT There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation! \nPAT SR. She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here. \nTIFFANY You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you? \nPAT SR. Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since-- \nTIFFANY \n(INTERRUPTING) You think that I'm why today's happened? \nPAT SR. That's right, you are why today happened. \nTIFFANY I'm the reason why today happened? \nPAT SR. I think so. \nTIFFANY Let's talk about that. \nPAT SR. Be my guest. \nTIFFANY The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS. \nJAKE She's right, Dad. \nTIFFANY The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen. \nPAT Wow. \nTIFFANY The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two. \nPAT Oh, wow. \nPAT SR. Let me think about that. Wait a minute. \nTIFFANY Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. \nPAT SR. He was with you? \nTIFFANY He was with me. We went for a run. \nRONNIE Really? That's crazy. \nTIFFANY There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. \nJAKE She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. \nTIFFANY Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? \"Excelsior.\" Look it up. Yeah, \"Excelsior.\" \nDOLORES Oh Pat. \nTIFFANY Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is \"Excelsior,\" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. \nRONNIE Unbelievable. \nPAT Wow. How did you know all that stuff? \nTIFFANY I did my research. \nSHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS. \nPAT SR. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed. \nTIFFANY Thank you. \nPAT SR. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. \nPAT Oh, now you like her, Dad? \nPAT SR. I have to say I do. Yup. \nRANDY Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil. \nTIFFANY Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years. \nPAT Is that right? \nTIFFANY You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it! \nRANDY That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that! \nTIFFANY You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. \nPAT SR. Yeah, prove it, prove it! \nRANDY How do you want me to prove it? \nPAT SR. How's he gonna prove it? \nTIFFANY By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing. \nPAT No, no, no, no, no, no, no. \nRANDY Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying? \nTIFFANY No. \nShe pauses, turns dramatically to Randy. \nTIFFANY (CONT'D) Against the Cowboys. \nEVERYONE GASPS. \nTIFFANY (CONT'D) That's your team isn't it, Randy? \nPAT That's his team! \nTIFFANY I know who his team is. \nRANDY When is the game? \nDR. PATEL Excelsior! Pat and Tiffany walk to sign in. \nPAT (Notices he and Tiffany are holding hands) Wait, what's this? \nTHEY ARE HOLDING HANDS. \nTIFFANY What?

She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with. \nTIFFANY Wow. \nPAT It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens. \nPAT (CONT'D) She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know?

He crosses away from Jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. Jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street. Carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double image of Carlos and the reflected street scene. Carlos leans over, pulls the pin from an M26 grenade, and lets the "spoon" come off in his hand. We HEAR the timing fuse hiss as Carlos nonchalantly counts to himself. 
CARLOS (counting) One thousand one... one thousand two... one thousand three... 
ANGLE ON - JACK 
He looks up just in time to see Carlos drop the grenade casually into the crowd below. Their eyes lock for a beat; then Carlos smiles, turns and bounds away. Jack's eyes widen in horror. He gets up, about to cry out a warning. 
CUT TO: 
ANGLE ON 
the crowd below as the grenade EXPLODES, filling the air with smoke and flying glass, its metal ripping through flesh and bone. People are wounded, bloody and writhing in pain and screaming in panic. 
ANGLE ON JACK 
disheveled, covered with the shattered glass of the window, but not but not seriously hurt, he struggles to his feet. He looks around for Carlos who has vanished, now realizing who he was. As he looks around, he sees a SMALL BOY staring at his left arm with heart-rending disbelief. 
The boy has no hand.

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - PARIS - DAY 
There are throngs of ambulances, police and military personnel, wounded survivors are being tended to. All is confusion and off in a corner we SEE Jack, standing with a man in a suit. The man's name is DU FOLTIERE. He shows Jack an I.D. 
DU FOLTIERE Du Foltiere, Monsieur, intelligence liaison officer. DST. My understanding is that you are the Deputy Chief of Station, CIA, Paris, and that you witnessed by coincidence this attack. 
JACK That's right. 
DU FOLTIERE And you have told my subordinate that you recognized the terrorist as Carlos? 
Du Foltiere pulls out a small notebook to take notes. 
JACK That's not what I told him. I said he recognized me. Afterwards I realized who he was. By then it was too late. 
DU FOLTIERE (writing in his notebook) Ah yes... The deputy chief of station did not recognize him... But he recognized you. 
JACK I wasn't the one wearing the disguise. 
DU FOLTIERE Yes of course... But then how are you sure it was him? 
JACK How often do you see someone holding a live grenade listening to the fuse? Besides, the arrogant son of a bitch bastard smiled at me. 
EXT. INT. OPEC HQ - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSED: Vienna, December 21, 1975 
It's a cold Sunday morning with a light snow just beginning to fall when SIX YOUNG MEN and ONE WOMAN enter the headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- a modern, seven-story block of concrete and glass. They all carry Adidas sport bags over their shoulders. Their leader, Carlos, with dark beret and sunglasses, sports a long white raincoat -- the kind that was very much in fashion that winter. Next to him is KOJ, a Japanese terrorist and his most trusted Lieutenant. 
CARLOS (singing) I shot the sheriff... But I did not shoot the deputy...

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THIRD FLOOR 
At a long oval table TWELVE OIL MINISTERS. Miniature national flags in chromium holders in front of them. Behind, sitting or standing, the SECRETARIES, ADVISERS, INTERPRETERS AND BODYGUARDS. 
VENEZUELAN OIL MINISTER ...Obviously some of the members are exploiting the oil price differentials as a loophole... This body has been very precise in its policy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - GROUND FLOOR 
The group with the Adidas sport bags approaches the reception desk. Carlos -- moustache, sideburns, and wispy beard in reddish brown -- smiles politely at the female RECEPTIONIST. Behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the railing at the top of the landing. There is what appears to be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece and tell-tale bulge under his jacket. 
CARLOS (in German) Pardon me. Is the conference still in progress? 
Smiling back, the ash-blonde receptionist nods. 
RECEPTIONIST (in German) Yes, but sir... 
CARLOS (in German) I have an urdent delivery for the ministers. 
As if on urgent business, Carlos quickly heads up the flight of stairs before the security man who stands next to the receptionist can react. The security man speaks quickly into his walkie talkie. 
ANGLE ON - THE LANDING 
by the elevator at the top of the stairs. Carlos bounds up the stairs and pushes the elevator button. The Security Man near the elevator listens intently to what is being said in his earpiece and he steps forward to challenge Carlos. Carlos smiles at him and whips out a 9mm. silenced Beretta and fires two shots right between the Security Man's eyes. He falls over the railing and lands face up on the console in front of the terrified receptionist. Carlos leans over the rail in one move and fires two shots into the upturned face of the Security Man who stands next to the shocked receptionist. The receptionist screams.

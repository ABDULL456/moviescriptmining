Haytham slowly looks up at Al-Ghazi. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   25. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) You saved lives today. I believe that. You served your country. I believe that. 
HAYTHAM I love my country. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I believe that, Haytham... 
Haytham Holds Al-Ghazi's eyes a good long beat... 
HAYTHAM I love my country... 
Al-Ghazi slow nods. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat, breaks eye-contact) You will have your revenge for what needed to be done to assure them you weren't involved. 
Haytham never blinks. Eyes hard. Stoic. Clear. 
36   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREETS - NOON                          36 
GRACE looks like a barrel-chested lineman. A four-man security detail behind. He and Ronald Fleury walk side-by- side. Janet Mayes just behind them. 
DIRECTOR GRACE Everyone's terrified, so nothing moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren't going anywhere. (beat) And this meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We'll be on record, but expect nothing more. 
Nothing from Fleury. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D) Can you handle this? Keep your mouth shut when people way above you say things you'll hate? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   26. 
RONALD FLEURY (beat) Yeah, sure. No problem. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (re: Janet) What about Agent Mayes? 
RONALD FLEURY Ask her. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (to Janet) What about you? 
JANET MAYES I'll be fine. 
37   INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - NOON           37 
Fleury, Grace and Mayes enter. Handsomely decorated, expansive: a lifetime of notable handshakes framed in black and white. The biggest is a picture of Young and Billy Graham that could be titled, `lucky for you, we have all the answers.' 
Gideon Young sits behind his Federalist-era oak desk: a marathoner's build, a smile too bright-perfect for his age. 
Two others in-attendance. A pear-shaped 54 year-old man with a Midwest-honest, ruddy-oval face: Ellis Leach, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Department of State 
And a 51 year-old Hispanic woman in conservative Chanel: enough femininity without diminishing toughness: Maricella Canavesio, Deputy National Security Advisor, White House 
DIRECTOR GRACE I apologize if we're late- 
GIDEON YOUNG They were early. 
DIRECTOR GRACE You know Special Agent Fleury? 
GIDEON YOUNG I do. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06    27. 
DIRECTOR GRACE This is agent Janet Mayes, she's one of our Arabic experts. 
Janet stares at Young, looking mildly in over her head. 
GIDEON YOUNG OK. The latest. 
Grace sits, nods to Fleury: you're up... 
RONALD FLEURY Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza. 
Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at a mushroom flavored Popsicle. 
GIDEON YOUNG Go on. 
Fleury continues: 
RONALD FLEURY A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack. (mildly sarcastic:) I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding. 
MARICELLA CANAVESIO My God. 
GIDEON YOUNG Let us never forget how cheap life is over there. Now...I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first? (to Fleury and Grace, slow like a Kindergarten teacher:) You two digested the memo? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   28. 
Stoic nods from each. Ellis Leach raises his hand, a tone that's worlds away from Young's. 
ELLIS LEACH I'll go first if that's okay Maricella? (off her `yeah, sure' nod) First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner. 
Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly. 
DIRECTOR GRACE As we are about Rex Burr.

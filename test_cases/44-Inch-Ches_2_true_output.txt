MUSIC... `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON... 
We are out of focus on purple... white... scattered sparkling "jewels"? begin to come into focus and we see that they are in fact pieces of broken glass... Thousands of splinters and shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet... the white fur of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... Ripped to shreds... In extreme C/U we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n... Sm as he d c ha ir s... Sm as he d photographs... Broken records... Ripped, shredded record sleeves -- `THE POWER OF LOVE' by JENNIFER RUSH -- `HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU' by OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN -- `I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU' by WHITNEY HOUSTON etc. 
The TV remote smashed to smithereens... The television -- widescreen -- TOTALLED!... We move along the plush `World of Leather' leather sofa... See that a chunk has been bitten out of it... See teeth marks -- like a bite out of cheese!... Moving on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt... Approaching the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness underneath... We can just make out the quizzical, frightened eyes of a white poodle... We move on... Past twisted, wrecked lampshades... Broken plates, ornaments... An up-ended vase of half-eaten flowers... NILSSON continues his self-pitying overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic chorus/crescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back in the corner of the devastated room... His shocked eyes staring wildly... His body petrified. Paralysed... As if frozen at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light... We stay on COLIN... His uncomprehending terror-filled eyes... His sheer rigor mortis-like horror... We move in on him... Into the black of his eyes... The tragic, agonised black..

We are outside, square on to an upstairs window of a detached suburban villa... We hear muffled sounds from inside the house... Yells... Screaming... Cries... Commotion... And suddenly the glass window explodes towards us as a desperate terrified woman comes crashing through... Having run full pelt to escape from something... This is LIZ, aged 44...

Television on... ARCHIE'S MUM aged 80 is eating soup from a tray on her lap... ARCHIE, aproned, watches on fondly... 
ARCHIE ...'Ow's that, Mum? 
MUM `S gorgeous, Archie! 
ARCHIE Put hairs on your chest, that will!... Pananarama'll be on soon -- after the new s... Da vi d Dim bl e- bim bl eb y! Your favourite! 
MUM (Pleased... eating) What is this? 
ARCHIE That -- Mulligatawny!      King of soups! 
MUM `S nice! 
Now a phone rings elsewhere in the house... 
ARCHIE Whoops -- there's me mobilius!     `Scuse I!... 
He leaves the room... Goes into the darkened pokey hallway... Takes his mobile phone from his car-coat pocket... Answers... 
ARCHIE (CONT'D) ...Who is this?... I'm not understandin' ya!... I'm not getting' ya!... `Ooever you are, stop cryin'!... Stop it! Listen -- I wanna help you... but I can't help you if I don't know who you are... and what you're on ab out ! W hat a re yo u on ab ou t? ... (listens)... Yeah, Archie, that's me... slow down... we'll get there much quicker if you -- ( re al is es ) -- Col? (MORE)

Music `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON... 
COLIN, as before, lying in the wrecked room... The music ends... Suddenly we hear ARCHIE'S voice ... 
ARCHIE'S VOICE (Gently) ... Col... Col... C'mon mate this is no good... Colin... 
We now see ARCHIE sitting in a nearby armchair, smoking, patient... 
ARCHIE ... C'mon mate, you can't lie `ere forever! 
The rigid COLIN, ignoring him, has suddenly, belatedly, realised that the music has stopped... Desperately needing his friend, NILSSON -- like a man in excruciating pain reaching for a gallon of morphine, he frantically, urgently twists his body on the floor and reaching behind, hammers the play button on the nearby ghetto blaster... And slowly, gently, kindly, the piano intro of NILSSON'S gorgeous wallow re- commences... Colin, somewhat soothed, eases back into his former rigid, mortified position.

KLUTE (CONT'D) Yeah? (then) Nothing yet, Trask; I'm going down the list. I've tried Spangler's office and Spangler's home; I just get his message service. I'll keep-- (interrupted -- listens -- then -- grimly) I may have steered Cable that way. I told him Bree was dealing for me, for Jane McKenna's book. Have you found any -- 
He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words on his end of things -- nods once -- 
KLUTE (CONT'D) Yeah. 
-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection, and starts dialing again -- We CUT TO -- 
INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT) 
Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level, employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past her. She continues up on until at one point -- one more officious or more communicative than the others informs her -- 
FOREMAN Lady, it's closing up there. 
BREE What? 
FOREMAN We're closing up, quitting time, Fabers. 
BREE (unsurely) I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. 
FOREMAN Oh, yeah. 
He lets her pass, glances after her like the others, continues on his way. 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY (NIGHT) 
Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still others press past her on their way down -- and comes more or less directly up against the thickset RECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree -- who sees no way to avoid the issue. 
BREE I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. 
RECEPTIONIST In there. (turns, bawls) Mr. Faber -- 
Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated, toward -- 
A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER 
NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to camera, conferring with another man as Bree approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly like his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE repeating -- 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) Mr. Faber -- 
As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a much younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing the error. 
NATHAN Yes? 
BREE I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior. 
NATHAN (calmly) My father went home about fifteen minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too good. 
She has already started away. He calls after her evenly -- 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Can I help you? 
She looks back quickly, smiles nervously -- 
BREE It wasn't important. 
But we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene -- until he turns away to other matters. Then -- 
RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE 
Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly -- 
BREE Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel. 
RECEPTIONIST Oh, I thought that was for tomorrow. 
The Receptionist riffles through a stack of assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and promptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS continue to move past her. She seeks a more private place.

GINGER I dunno. 
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 37 Brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the wounds. 
BRIGITTE Oooh. Tickly. 
GINGER I got it on my tits too, look. 
BRIGITTE Weird. Does it hurt? 
GINGER No, it's itchy. I can't have a hairy chest Bee, that's fucked. 
BRIGITTE Yeah, like forget that tattoo you wanned. 
GINGER This sucks. 
BRIGITTE Quito badly. The idiocy of the looks of awe on the other's face makes them both crack up. 
GINGER 
(LAUGHING) This isn't funny. 
BR I G ITTE (laughing hard) I know, but okay. what I think? (she counts on her 
FINGERS) Attacked. On a full moon. Now, yer hairy. 
GINGER 
(SNORTING) I'm not Harry, I'm Ginger. 
BRIGITTE (snorting too) Stop, I'm serious. Think about it. Ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion settle. 
GINGER That's so stupid! They both burst into gales again. There is a sound outside the stall, as 
INT. BATHROOM PROPER - DAY 
The Trinas prance in to powder their noses. The Trina grabs the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's. Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in headlights. Trina does not see Ginger's transformation. But Ginger Is just doing her top up. 
TRINA Eeeew! Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth. 
TRINA Gawd: They're lesbos! 
CLONES Feeeewww!! Brigitte smacks her forehead. Ginger steps out and leers at Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust. The Trinas shrink back against the farthest wall. 
GINGER Yeah, who's next? I'm still sticky! Brigitte's jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas, start to relax. Ginger whips around again: 
GINGER (barking like a dog) Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf 
TRINAS 
(SHRIEK) Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks out. Brigitte stumbles out after her.

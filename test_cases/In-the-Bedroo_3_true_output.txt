RICHARD O.S. 
(IRRITATED) .Jesus. Matt looks to Richard with a renewed sense of purpose. 
TT .keep going. 
LIVING ROOM A light flicks on. They take the hall past the living room. Matt doesn't want to see anymore of Richard's life. But he can't help hÂ° elf. He takes it all in: Magazines and newspapers in a wicker basket, clean ashtrays, a stereo, CD's neatly shelved next to it. They continue down a hallway.Richard stops outside a door. 
RIC There's no wall switch. 
MATT Where's the light? 
RIC the bed. 
Let's go. Richard steps into the darkness. Matt is careful to stay a pace behind. Richard leans over by the bed. Matt braces. lick. A small bedside lamp turns on. The bed, a double one, is neatly made; the ashtray on the bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no photographs- prob ly so the girl - who is scae? - won't have to see Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs. But because Matt is a father and a husband, thou h never ex- husband, he knows (and does not want to ow that this bedroom has never been theirs alone. Richard turns around; Matt looks at his lips, his wide jaw. 
RICHARD I wanted to work things out with her. Try to get together with her again. But I couldn't even talk to her. He was always with her. Dr. Fowler, I'm going to jail for it. I am going to jail. If I ever get out I'll be an old man. Isn't that enough ? 
MAXT You're not going to jail. Pack clothes for warm weather. 
RIC What's going on? You're not gonna let me go! Matt looks away. He doesn't answer. 
RICHARD Dr. Fowler? 
MATT You're jumping bail. 
RIC .Dr. Fowler. Matt points the pistol at Richard's face. The barrel trembles a little. Richard reaches up into his closet and pulls out two large canvas bags. He places them on the - He pulls a third bag, a small, red, woman's suitcase, Natalie's no doubt, next to the others. He moves to the bureau. 
MATT It's the trial. We can't go through that, my wife and me. So you're leaving. I've got you a ticket. My wife keeps seeing you. I can't have that anymore... 
RIC He was making it with my wife. I'd go pick up my kids and he'd be there. Sometimes he spent the night. Duncan told me. He doesn't look at Matt as he speaks. He opens the to ewer. Matt steps closer so he can see Richard's hangs. underwear and the socks rolled, the underwear folded and stacked. Richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase. The kitchen the livin room the clothes. Matt is struck b this man's sense of order, o iscio ine. Matt watches the absurdity of Richard sorting clothes by season. He even packs a small instamatic camera. He packs the things a man accumulates and become part of him. 
MATT (re: the suitcases) Okay, that's enough. 
RICHARD I need some things from the bathroom. 
MATT alright. 
THE BATHROOM Richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops. 
MATT Keep going. 
RICHARD Gotta pee. Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy. He pushes him into the room. Takes a step back and pulls the door so it is only slightly ajar. He keeps his foot between the jam and the door. He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror. He can hear him make water. He looks like he wonders about allowing this courtesy. Mattes glances at: A picture on the wall outside of the bathroom: Natalie Richard and their two boys, in front of someone's house. Smiling. She looks happy. 
C looks around the room frantically - his eyes find nothing that will help his situation - he flushes the toilet - Matt swings the door fully open - Richard fills a travel kit with toiletries. 
RICHARD'S BEDROOM Richard tucks the travel kit into a bag. Matt keeps the gun on him. Richard closes the suitcase, and faces Matt. He looks at the Matt moves around behind him. Now Richard is between Matt and the lighted hall. Richard carries a canvas bag in each hand. Matt pulls another glove from his pocket. He uses it to turn off the bedside lamp. Richard now d'_lhouetted in the doorway. Let's go. Richard steps into the hall. Matt follows, carrying the small suitcase in one hand, the gun in the other. They start down the hallway. Matt turns off lights with his elbow as they go. Past the living room into the kitchen. Wait. Richard tenses, he stops at the kitchen door. Matt sets the suitcase down. He uses that hand to reach into his jacket. He pulls out a red, white, and blue piece of paper. He drops it on the counter top. Words on the paper read AMT RACK. Matt picks up the suitcase again. He steps closer to him. Presses the gun into Richard's back. 
MATT open the door. Richard's reaches down and carefully turns the knob. He slowly pulls the door open. Matt takes a step back. 
MATT Get the light. Richard reaches down and hits the switch. Click. The two men now in silhouette. Richard exits first. Matt close behind.

Not Eng. They reac the garage walk to the back of the Brown Suburban. Richard drops the two bags near the rear bumper. 
Matt keeps the gun steady as Richard pops open the hatch and loads the bags. Matt sets the small suitcase at Richard's feet. He reaches down and loads it last. 
/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN S 
Richard gets into the driver's seat. Matt in the back. Richard looks up in the rear-view. For a moment, Matt connects with the desperate eyes. 
RIC They'll catch me. They'll check passenger lists.

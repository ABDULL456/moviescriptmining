Elle hustles them out the door. 
ELLE 
I'll call you as soon as it's over, okay? Sisters forever? 
MARGOT AND SERENA 
Sister forever. She shuts the door behind them.    Then looks at Sarah. 
ELLE 
(continuing) Sorry about that. 
Sarah sets down the Veuve. 
SARAH 
Save it. 
She smiles at Elle. 
SARAH (CONT'D) 
(continuing) We'll drink it after we win. 
Elle smiles . 
107   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - DAY                                         107 
Paulette arranges a nail polish display by the door. 
UPS GUY (O.S.) 
I've got a big one for you. Paulette freezes and slowly turns to find UPS Guy holding out a big package. 
UPS GUY (CONT'D) 
Can you sign? 
He hands her the computerized tablet and as he does, the pen velcroed to the side falls off. Paulette watches as it FALLS IN SLO-MO. Realizing that now is the perfect time to try the Bend & Snap. 
(CONTINUED) 
She bends slowly, tush out, knee cocked. She grabs the pen and as she prepares to Snap back up, UPS Guy leans over to help. 
UPS GUY (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Got it? Not realizing he's leaning over, she SNAPS back up -- CLOCKING him in the NOSE with her head. 
He reels backward, holding his nose, blood flowing as Paulette stares at him-in horror. 
PAULETTE 
Oh my God! 
CUT TO: 
108   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                               108 
Elle waits in line for the water fountain, talking on her cell phone. 
ELLE 
(into phone) You broke his nose?! 
We INTERCUT with Paulette as she watches- UPS Guy being carried out by paramedics on a gurney. The ladies of the shop flutter around him, concerned. 
UPS GUY 
I 'm okay -- 
PAULETTE 
I think he noticed me, Elle -- (sobbing) But only because I maimed him! 
ELLE 
(consoling) I'll be over right after the trial, okay? We're about to cross- examine Enrique. And don't worry! My friend Serena barfed on a guy during "The Blair Witch Project" and end up dating him for three months. She hangs up. Enrique cuts in front of her in line for the water fountain. She glares at him, tapping her foot. He finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her. 
(CONTINUED) 
ENRIQUE 
Don't stomp your little Prada sandals at me, Miss Thing. He walks past, as.Elle gapes at him.     Realizing. 
109   INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                           109 
Elle grabs Emmett's arm as he whispers with Donovan. 
ELLE 
He's gay!    Enrique is gay! 
EMMETT 
What?! She grabs Warner as he's passing. 
ELLE 
Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on? 
He looks down at her Prada sandals. 
WARNER 
Pink ones. 
ELLE 
See? 
Donovan frowns, not seeing. 
DONOVAN 
What are you talking about? 
ELLE 
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off. 
EMMETT 
Back up.     How do you know he's gay? 
ELLE 
Gay men know designers.     Straight men don't. She points at Warner, who shrugs. Brooke leans over.

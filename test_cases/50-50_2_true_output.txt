Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. The only indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy, tying to anticipate his mother's next move. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Mom? 
Edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen. Adam follows after her. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Mom, what are you doing? 
Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea. 
EDITH I'm making you green tea. 
ADAM Please, will you come sit down. 
Edith holds up the package of Green Tea. 
EDITH I saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent. 
ADAM Mom, I already have cancer. 
Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack. 
EDITH Here take these. 
Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a large number of prescription pills. 
EDITH (CONT'D) Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor, Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer. 
ADAM Mom, please, stop. I don't need these. 
EDITH (YELLS) Just take the god-damn pills. 
Adam take Edith's hand. 
ADAM Mom. 
Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical. 
EDITH How could this happen? 
ADAM It's genetic. 
EDITH Genetic? It must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick. Your uncle Bobby just got Crohns. 
Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash... 
ART That's a disorder of the bowels, son. How are your bowels? 
ADAM The problem is not with my bowels. 
ART You're a lucky man. 
ADAM Thanks dad. 
EDITH I'm moving in. 
ADAM What? No. Absolutely not. 
EDITH Adam, I'm your mother, and I need to be close to you in your time of need. 
ADAM That's a terrible idea. 
EDITH Well who's going to take care of you? 
ADAM Mom, I'm fine. 
EDITH I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer. 
ADAM It's nothing. Really. 
EDITH Nothing! You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing. 
Adam looks to Rachel for support. 
RACHEL Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But I promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. I'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son. 
EDITH (TO ADAM) You're a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl. You know that? You don't deserve her. 
Adam looks at Rachel and smiles. 
ADAM I know. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING 
Adam and Seth stand on an endless line of BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN waiting for their morning coffee. Greg is at the front of that line - he's taking forever to decide what he wants. Adam impatiently looks at his watch.

Come on! The rest of you get in here and riot! Break this crowd up! Come on! 
Med. shot: Of a group of John Does. They still stare uncertainly. Suddenly, the head of one of SHELDON's troopers appearand cupping his hands over his mouth, he yells toward platform. 
TROOPER 
John Doe's a fake! Boo! Boooooo! 
Long shot: From ANNOUNCER's view. Shooting toward audience. The crowd is all yelling at once now. 
Med. shot: 
ANNOUNCER 
I'm sorry, folks, but we can't hear him any more. Something's gone wrong with the loudspeaker. 
Med. shot: Of JOHN. Trying to talk over microphone. 
JOHN 
Say, they can't hear me! The thing's not working! 
(shouts) 
Ladies and gentlemen! Lookthis thing's bigger than whether I'm a fake 
(turns to BERT) 
Look, Bert, you believe me, don't you? 
BERT 
(cynically) 
Sure, I believe you. Walking my legs off digging up five thousand signatures for a phoney! 
Suddenly, nervously, he begins tearing up the petition in his hand. 
BERT 
Well, there you are, Mr. Doe! 
(flinging crumpled petition at him) 
Five thousand names asking you not to jump off any roof! 
He turns to leave. 
Close shot: Of SOURPUSS, who, heartbroken, stops BERT. 
SOURPUSS 
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club. 
BERT 
(harshly) 
Yeah? Well, you can have it! 
He exits. 
Long shot: From ANNOUNCER's view. Crowd is yelling wildly. 
ANNOUNCER 
They're starting to throw things! 
2ND ANNOUNCER 
Somebody's going to get hurt! 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He looks helplessly down at the hostile crowd. 
Int. police station: Full shot: ANN and CONNELL are surrounded by several policemen. A sergeant sits at his desk, on which is a radio. ANN's face is haggard and desperate as she listens to the radio announcer. 
ANNOUNCER 
I'm afraid it'll be John Doe. Listen to that mob! 
Unable to stand it any longer, ANN suddenly jumps out of her seat. 
ANN 
I've got to go to him! 
OFFICER 
Sorry, ladyI can't let you out. 
ANN 
(sobbing) 
Oh, let me go! Let me go to him! Oh, please, please let me go! They're crucifying him! I can help him! 
OFFICER 
Sorry, sister. We got orders to hold you. 
ANN 
Orders from who? Can't they see it's a frameup? 
She is still desperately struggling to get freewhen her mother comes hurrying in. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Ann, darling! 
ANN 
Oh, Mother! They won't let me go! They won't let me go! 
The police release her and she throws herself into her mother's arms. 
Ext.: Ball park. Close shot: Of JOHN. He still attempts to get himself heard. 
JOHN 
Listen, folks! You gotta listen to me, everybody! 
Med. shot: Of a group of John Does. 
A MAN 
(yelling toward JOHN) 
Back to the jungle, you hobo! 
2ND MAN 
(disgustedly) 
Just another racket! 
JOHN'S VOICE 
Stick to your clubs! 
MAN 
(shouting) 
We've been fed baloney so long we're getting used to it! 
Close shot: Of JOHN. He disregards the missiles that fly around his head. 
JOHN 
(supplicatingly) 
The idea is still good! Believe me, folks! . . . 
Ext.: Ball park. Med. long shot: Toward platform. The crowd pushes menacingly around the platform, with policemen struggling to control them. JOHN still stands there, pathetic and helpless. Missiles of all kinds fly into the scene. The members of the band are scrambling off the platformas well as the others, until John is left alone. 
Long shot: Shooting toward audience. They still boo and yell. 
Med. shot: Of the COLONEL. Fearful for JOHN, he starts pushing his way through the crowd toward him. 
Med. shot: Of a group of people. Suddenly a woman reaches into a lunch basket she carries and takes out a tomato. 
WOMAN 
(shouting) 
You faker! 
She reaches back to throw the tomato. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His voice is gone. His eyes are glassy. He is making one last effort to speak. 
JOHN 
(hoarsely)

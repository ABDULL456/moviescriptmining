INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather thong. 
BAVMORDA Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the first candle. 
A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav- morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a large circular hole showing the starlit sky. 
BAVMORDA Come, thunder.  Come lightning. Touch this altar with your pwer. Come into my tower... 
Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction. 
A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites: 
BAVMORDA Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and bind, bind and blend, Universal night!  And the might of Nockmaar! 
Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning flashes again, getting closer. 
INT. TENT - NIGHT 
Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes closed. 
RAZIEL It's over, Willow.  You did well. You protected yourself. 
Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door. 
EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT 
Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent. 
INT. TENT - NIGHT 
Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel. 
WILLOW I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die! 
RAZIEL No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda! 
WILLOW She's too powerful, Raziel 
Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof. 
RAZIEL A true magician, Willow, never surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I am a sorceress!  Transform me now and I will destroy her!  Hexagram! 
Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra- ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his philosopher's stone and begins his magic. 
WILLOW Banish all disturbing forces from this place.  Fire, water, above and below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal- ance. 
Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own powers of concentration and will, now and then losing strength. 
RAZIEL (voice distorted) Don't give up!  Willow! 
He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer. Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers her unclothed body with a simple smock. 
WILLOW Raziel! 
She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus with purpose. 
RAZIEL We've got a lot of work to do, Wil- low.  Bring in our brave men. 
Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra- ziel begins to change them back into warriors. 
EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT 
Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN- IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower. 
INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT 
A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments into a Witch's Bottle. 
BAVMORDA Black fire forever kindled within, Let the second right begin! 
With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens asnwer with distant thunder. 
EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT 
In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear. 
INT. TENT - NIGHT 
Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

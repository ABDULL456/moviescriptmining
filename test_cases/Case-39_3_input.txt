Emily shoves Margaret aside and throws open the oven. Pulls Lucy out onto the kitchen floor, swatting out her burning pajamas with a dish towel. 
Margaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at Emily, but Barron has her covered. Backhands Margaret so hard it spins her around fully before dropping her to the floor. 
BARRON The hell's the matter with you people?! 
Pajamas scorched, wild with terror, Lucy cries in great heaving sobs in Emily's arms. Reduced to tears herself, Emily keeps saying the same thing over and over. 
EMILY I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha... 
Shielding her from the sight of her parents: Margaret sprawled on the linoleum weeping. Edward slouched against the fridge, blood pouring down his shirt, his broken jaw hanging open like a man thinking wow. 
INT. COUNTY COURTROOM - DAY 
Edward and Margaret holding hands at the defendant's table, remorseless and defiant in their Sunday best. Among the many spectators we find Emily and Mike Barron. The STATE PROSECUTOR and PUBLIC DEFENDER addressing the JUDGE. 
STATE PROSECUTOR Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense. This was an act committed with premeditation, malice AFORETHOUGHT - 
PUBLIC DEFENDER Your honor, the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant. 
JUDGE Yes. I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial. 
Emily rolls her eyes at Barron, some justice system. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY 
Barron walks Emily to her car. She's outraged. 
EMILY Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis. 
BARRON Well, you're gonna hate me for saying this, but my money's on crazy. 
EMILY Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well! 
BARRON It's not that simple sometimes. 
EMILY (stops on a dime) Meaning what exactly? 
Barron hesitates. He's crossing the line by telling her this. 
BARRON When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister... They think she's evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion of the devil or something. 
EMILY (LAUGHS) Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? 
BARRON No, but that might be the world they're living in. 
INT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY 
Lucy in a hospital bed, dressings on her hand. Emily's friend Doug sitting bedside. Child psychologist. 
DOUG -- and what's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember? 
LUCY It's not my fault what happened. 
DOUG That's right and you know what? It's not. 
Lucy nods, not entirely convinced. Doug gives her a pat, crosses to the exit. At the door he runs into Emily. Shakes his head, awed at what she did. 
DOUG That is some seriously proactive social work happenin' there. You all right? 
EMILY Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing? 
DOUG Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll get there. I'm gonna put her in a group setting, see if I can get her to open up. 
EMILY Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world? 
He nods - no kidding, heads off. Emily comes over and sits on Lucy's bed. Strokes her hair. 
EMILY Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow. 
LUCY Doug said I might have to go to a state home. 
EMILY Only for a few days, till we find a better place. 
LUCY Why can't I live with you? 
EMILY Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed. 
LUCY Why? 
EMILY It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent... 
Lucy gives a sad nod. Emily touches her arm. 
EMILY I'm sorry.

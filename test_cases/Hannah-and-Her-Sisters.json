I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes. \nDAVID (turning to April, emphatically) You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment. \nAPRIL (shaking her head) Oh-- \nHOLLY (interrupting, gesturing and nodding) Oh, it's really important. \nDavid turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back to April. \nAPRIL (looking only at David) What are your favorite buildings, David? \nDAVID You want to see some? \nAPRIL (nodding) Oh, yeah. \nDAVID Well, let's do it. \nAPRIL (looking at David) Great. \nDavid starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through New York City's landmark buildings, as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar. Inspiring classical music plays in the background. \nThe series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth Street, the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building, Abigail Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side.  The group can be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row houses and shrubbery.  A lamppost sits in the foreground. \nIt is now dark.  The music continues to play as the film cuts to the fa\u00e7ade of a rococo-style building, complete with French doors and ornate windows.  The admiring group is heard offscreen. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown... \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Yes. \nHOLLY (offscreen, continuing) ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony -- \nAPRIL (offscreen, interrupting) It's French, though.  It really is. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Yeah. \nAPRIL (offscreen, overlapping) It feels like you're in France. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) It-it is.  It's romantic. \nThe music stops.  The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's fa\u00e7ade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it. \nDAVID (offscreen) And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Yeah. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then... \nThe film moves from the two elegant fa\u00e7ade to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs. \nAPRIL (offscreen) That's just -- \nDAVID (offscreen, interrupting) Look at this. \nHOLLY (offscreen) That's disgusting! \nAPRIL (offscreen, continuing) ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that? \nHOLLY (offscreen, overlapping) It's really terrible. \nDAVID (offscreen, emphatically) It's really sad. \nHOLLY (offscreen) And it ruins everything else. \nDAVID (offscreen, agreeing) It does. \nThe film moves from the ugly fa\u00e7ade to the building's equally ugly entrance.  A large car is parked right in front of the building. \nAPRIL (offscreen) Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though. \nHOLLY (offscreen, chuckling) Yeah. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Yeah. \nAPRIL (offscreen, overlapping) A lot of works. \nThe group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly fa\u00e7ades across the way.  David is in the lead; the women follow, Holly slightly behind April. \nHOLLY (nodding) Yeah. \nDAVID (glancing at his watch) Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? \nHOLLY Fast. \nAPRIL Oh, geez, yeah. \nHOLLY (overlapped) Okay. \nThey walk towards the car. \nDAVID (looking back at the women as he walks around the car to the driver's side) Uh, who gets dropped first? \nAPRIL Uh -- \nHOLLY (overlapping, looking at April) Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um... \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Well... \nAPRIL (overlapping) Well, I live downtown. \nHOLLY (glancing at April) Yeah, I, we both live downtown. \n", "test1_true": "APRIL (gesturing) Uh... \nHOLLY (to David) It depends on what way you want to go. \nAPRIL (overlapping) Well, wait.  You know what?  I know. \nHOLLY Uh... \nAPRIL (to Holly, gesturing) If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah? \nDAVID (overlapping, nodding) We could...we could do that. \nHOLLY (nodding) Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it? \nShe looks at David. \nAPRIL (overlapping, to Holly) Well, sometimes, some, uh... \nHOLLY (interrupting) I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um... \nBoth she and April mumble awkwardly. \nDAVID (pointing to Holly, interrupting their chatter) Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you? \nHOLLY (nodding at David) Yes. \nDAVID Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first. \nHOLLY (nodding nervously) Oh, okay. \nAPRIL Yeah. \nDAVID And then, uh, April...huh? \nAPRIL (overlapping, nodding) Great. \nThey get into the car.  Once again Holly's in the backseat. The classical music begins anew. \nThe movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar.  It then moves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her head near the window.  She is staring straight ahead. \nHOLLY (V.O.) Naturally I get taken home first. Well, obviously he prefers April. Of course I was so tongue-tied all night.  I can't believe I said that about the Guggenheim.  My stupid little roller-skating joke.  I should never tell jokes.  Mom can tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em. (glaring at the offscreen April's back) Where did April come up with that stuff about Adolph Loos and terms like \"organic form\"? (looking out the side window, pausing for a moment) Well, naturally.  She went to Brandeis. \nThe movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street.  Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David. \nHOLLY (V.O.) But I don't think she knows what she's talking about.  Could you believe the way she was calling him David? \"Yes, David.  I feel that way, too, David.  What a marvelous space, David.\" (emphatically) I hate April.  She's pushy. \nThe film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought. \nHOLLY (V.O.) Now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up.  I blew it. (sighing, looking out the side window) And I really like him a lot.  Oh, screw it.  I'm not gonna get all upset.  I've got reading to do tonight.  You know, maybe I'll get into bed early.  I'll turn to a movie and take an extra Seconal. \nThe classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins.  The screen cuts to black and a title appears. \n\"...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - DAY \nThe movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby.  He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. \nThe movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him.  He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot.  A truck passes down the street.  Lee doesn't see him.  She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. \nElliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. \nThe jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. \nLee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch.  She looks up in surprise; the music stops. \nELLIOT (trying not to sound out of breath) Oh, my goodness! \nLEE (overlapping, smiling in surprise) Oh, Elliot! \nELLIOT Hi. \nLEE (smiling) What are you doing here? \nELLIOT (looking around, gesturing) Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore. \nLEE (shaking her head) Oh, what, in this section of town? \nELLIOT Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill-- \nLEE (overlapping) You're out looking here? \nELLIOT (glancing at his watch again) Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early. \nLEE (laughing) Ohhhh! \nELLIOT (gesturing) How about you? \nLEE Oh.  Well, I live-- \nELLIOT (interrupting, chuckling) Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you? \nLEE (overlapping, chuckling) Yes, I do. \nELLIOT (putting his hands behind his back) Where are you headed? \nLEE Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol. \nThey begin to walk down the street. \nLEE (laughing) Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on. \nELLIOT (looking at Lee) Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy. \nLEE Yeah, unhappy and fat. (chuckling) And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know. \n", "test1_id": 12, "test2_input": "LEE (looking at an offscreen Frederick, gesturing) Big.  Frederick, show him the oils. \nFREDERICK (offscreen) They're in the basement. \nThe camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door.  Frederick follows at a distance. \nLEE (to Dusty) Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love. \nDUSTY (overlapping, muttering) Well, are...are they big? \nLEE Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big. \nDUSTY 'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. (chuckling) \nFREDERICK (angrily stopping in his tracks) I don't sell my work by the yard! \nLEE (chuckling, reacting) Oh, Frederick! \nThe camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft.  He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee. \nELLIOT (chuckling softly) How's everything? \nLEE (walking onscreen towards Elliot) Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend. \nELLIOT Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. \nLEE (nodding, her arms clasped around her chest) Oh, yeah. \nELLIOT (chuckling) But I go nuts.  It's a conflict. \nHe laughs.  Lee, uneasy, looks down. \nLEE I have to get my teeth cleaned this week. \nELLIOT Oh, that's nice. \nThere's an awkward moment of silence. \nELLIOT (breaking the silence, pointing in the direction of the door) I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together. \nLEE (looking in the same direction, gesturing) Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you. \nELLIOT Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars. \nLEE (nodding, wrapping her arms around her chest again) Oh. \nELLIOT He's got like six gold records. \nLEE (gesturing, relieved that she's found something to say) Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended... \nThe camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf. \nLEE (continuing) ...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that I think you'd love.  It's a... another Bach, second movement. \nShe pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, you-you have that one? \nLEE (working at the stereo, turning her head towards Elliot) Yeah. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, I would love to hear it. \nBach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room. \nLEE (putting the turntable cover in place) Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. (chuckling) \nThe record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit.  She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. \nLEE (intently) Isn't that beautiful? \nELLIOT (looking at Lee, his hands clasped in front of him) I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites. \nLee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. \nELLIOT (after a pause) Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings? \nLEE (wrapping her arms around her chest and looking away from Elliot for a moment) Yes, he's just adorable. \nElliot nods. \nLEE (awkwardly) They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS. \nELLIOT (taking a breath) Oh, right. \nThere is another moment of silence.  Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest.  The harpsichord plays on. \nELLIOT (softly) Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve? \nLEE Yes, it made me cry (tentatively looking at Elliot) it was so beautiful...so romantic. \nLee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I want so badly to kiss her.  Not here, you idiot.  You've got to get her alone someplace. \nAs Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away.  The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. \nELLIOT (V.O.) But I've got to proceed cautiously. This is a very delicate situation. Okay, uh...ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow. \nLee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. \nELLIOT (V.O.) And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically. \nLEE (showing Elliot a poem in her book) Did you ever read this one--? \nElliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. \n", "test2_true": "ELLIOT Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you. \nHe kisses Lee again.  He clumsily turns around; she humps against the stereo unit.  As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable.  The needle scratches loudly.  Lee, shocked, is gasping.  The record, pushed to a different part of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue. \nELLIOT (breathing hard) Oh! \nLEE (gasping) What are you doing?! \nELLIOT (frantically) I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you. \nLee stares at Elliot in shock. \nLEE (still gasping) Elliot! \nELLIOT (gesturing desperately) I have been in love with you for so long. \nFrederick and Dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument, are suddenly heard.  Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway.  Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty.  They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo.  Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book. \nFREDERICK (angrily) Please forget it!  I don't have any interest in selling anything! \nDUSTY (gesturing) I ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle! \nLEE (in a slightly higher-pitched voice) What's the problem? \nFREDERICK (pulling the nude drawings off his easel angrily) I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?! \nDUSTY (overlapping, gesturing) Well, I can't commit to anything without consulting her first. That's what I have her for, okay? \nFREDERICK (carrying the drawings off) This is degrading!  You don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa! \nDUSTY (looking after Frederick) It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman! (touching his forehead, turning to Elliot) God, forget it!  Let's just get outta here, Elliot. \nELLIOT (putting down the book) We'll go. \nThe film moves outside the loft building.  Dusty and Elliot emerge and walk to Dusty's waiting limousine.  Elliot is rubbing his forehead, anguished. \nDUSTY (angrily, getting into the car) What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid. (noticing Elliot's anguished face) What's the matter with you? \nELLIOT (gesturing) Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay. \nDUSTY (overlapping) It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off. \nELLIOT (gesturing) Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead. \nDUSTY Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT (overlapping, nervously) Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead. \nDusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving. \nELLIOT (continuing, gesturing) You go.  Go on.  Go. \nThe limousine drives off.  Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street.  He picks up the phone and dials. \nThe film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone.  It rings.  Frederick picks it up. \nFREDERICK (into the telephone) Hello?  Hello?  Hello? \nWhen no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up.  He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner. \nLEE (gesturing in relief) Oh!  There you are! \nElliot mumbles, relieved and confused. \nLEE I was looking for you. \nELLIOT (gesturing) I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up. \nLEE (gesturing) Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing? \nElliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft.  He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes. \nELLIOT (taking Lee's arm) Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you. \nLEE Oh, don't say those words! \nELLIOT (overlapping, shaking his head) I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible. \nLEE (pushing back her hair, shaking her head hopelessly) Why, you know the situation. \nShe sighs. \nELLIOT (looking away for a moment) I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize. \nLEE What do you expect me to say? \nELLIOT Hannah and I are in the last stages. \nLEE (shaking her head) Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing. \nELLIOT Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her. \nLEE Not because of me, I hope. \nELLIOT Oh, no, no. (nodding) Well, yes!  I love you. \nLEE Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus-- \nELLIOT (overlapping, shaking his head) Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway. \nLEE Why? \nELLIOT Tch, w-well, for a million reasons. \nLEE (gesturing) But not over me? \nELLIOT Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions. \nLEE (looking down) Poor Hannah. \n", "test2_id": 13, "test3_input": "MICKEY (V.O.) ...I really hit bottom.  You know, I just felt that in a Godless universe, I didn't want to go on living.  Now I happen to own this rifle... (coughing) \nMickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead.  He shuts his eyes tightly. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...which I loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead. And I remember thinking, at the time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then I thought...what if I'm wrong? What if there is a God?  I mean, after all, nobody really knows that. \nThe camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him.  Its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps.  A clock faintly ticks. \nMICKEY (V.O.) But then I thought, no.  You know, maybe is not good enough.  I want certainty or nothing.  And I remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and I was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot. \nThe gun goes off with a loud bang.  The mirror shatters. \nMICKEY (V.O.) All of a sudden, the gun went off. \nMickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror.  The sounds of his excited neighbors, their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his tale. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently... \nNEIGHBOR #1 (offscreen, overlapping) What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's going on? \nMICKEY (V.O.) (continuing) ...but I was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me. \nNEIGHBOR #2 (offscreen, overlapping) I don't know.  I heard a gun.  Is everything all right? \nMickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit living room.  He looks around frantically, his shirt loose. \nFinally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table.  The gun goes off a second time.  Mickey, standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head.  The doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door. \nMICKEY (V.O.) And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and-and I don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium.  And, uh, you know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door. \nMickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I-I-I-I didn't know what to say. You know, I was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute... \nHe returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...and I-I jus knew one thing. \nThe film cuts to a West Side street.  It's an overcast day. Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including Klein's Pharmacy and a \"Bar-B-Q\" take out.  Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that house.  I had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head. And I remember very clearly.  I walked the streets.  I walked and I walked.  I-I didn't know what was going through my mind.  It all seemed so violent and un-unreal to me.  And I wandered... \nThe movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside.  Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by.  His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...for a long time on the Upper West Side, you know, an-and it must have been hours!  You know, my, my feet hurt.  My head was, was pounding, and, and I had to sit down.  I went into a movie house. I-I didn't know what was playing or anything. \nMickey walks into the movie house.  He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside.  He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I just, I just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective. \nThe film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone.  The sounds of the \"xylophone\" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat.  The \"xylophone\" music stops and changes to \"Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho\" as sung by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie.  The singing continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his tale: \nMICKEY (V.O.) And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I sat down (sighing) and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I'd seen many times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it.  And, you know, I'm, I'm watching these people up on the screen, and I started getting hooked o-on the film, you know? \nThe film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk.  The Marx Brothers, as well as the hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing \"Hidee-hidee-ho.\" They kick their heels up in the air.  They sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing \"Oh-h-h-h-h-h...\" \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...And I started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? I mean, isn't it so stupid?  I mean, l-look at all the people up there on the screen.  You know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true? \nThe movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater.  The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak. \nMICKEY (V.O.) What if there's no God, and you only go around once and that's it? Well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience?  You know, what the hell, it-i-it's not all a drag.  And I'm thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life... \nAs Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen.  The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...searching for answers I'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts.  And...you know... \nThe film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...after, who knows?  I mean, you know, maybe there is something. Nobody really knows.  I know, I know \"maybe\" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have.  And...then, I started to sit back, and I actually began to enjoy myself. \nAs Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen.  The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members.  They jump down from the bench, still singing. Their voices swell. \nMARX BROTHERS & COMPANY \"Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming around the mountain...\" \nThe Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park.  The flashback is over. Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as \"You Made Me Love You\" begins to play in the background.  They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. \nHOLLY (gesturing) Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and (chuckling) that's this. \nMICKEY (mumbling) Oh, yeah?  What? \nHOLLY (overlapping) That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself. \nMICKEY Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous. \nHOLLY (overlapping) It's all right. \nMICKEY I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- (inhaling) \nHolly laughs. \nMICKEY So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or... \nHOLLY Sure.  Sure, uh, yes. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening? \nHOLLY Yeah. \nThey stroll offscreen. \"You Made Me Love You\" grows louder and the film cuts to: \nOne year later. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT \nA large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking through the doorway. \n", "test3_true": "HANNAH (offscreen, overlapping) It's on the table, Dad. \nThe sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are dimly heard; \"You Made Me Love You\" continues softly in the background.  Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand.  Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove. \nEVAN (putting ice into his glass) Hey, where's Holly?  She's late. \nAs Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses. \nLEE (walking briskly to the sink) Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed. \nHANNAH (offscreen, in another area of the kitchen) I know, she...she really writes good dialogue. \nLEE (turning to the offscreen Hannah) Yeah.  I'll get some ice. \nLee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air.  Hannah, in a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen. \nNORMA Hannah, can I tell everybody you're going to play Desdemona? \nNorma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin. \nHANNAH (taking a big sip of her wine) Oh, Mom, it's only television. (beginning to mash some sweet potatoes in a bowl on the table) \nNORMA (gesturing with the bottle) Yes, but it's public television. And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get any greater than Othello.  You with some big black stud!  I love it! \nNorma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting. \nHANNAH (gasping and laughing) Oh, Mom! \nEVAN (overlapping, reacting) Oh, honey! \nThe movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room.  Upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party.  Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.  He passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room, nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way. \nHe enters the living room, smiling.  It is crowded with guests; Hannah's children play in their midst.  One of Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm.  They playfully \"spar\" for a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing on his way into a connecting room.  He stops at the doorway, looking at the crowd.  The camera shows his point of view: Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink, walks over to a group of other guests. \nThe film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view once more.  This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug, talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background. Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple. \nELLIOT (V.O.) Oh, Lee, you are something. \nLee and Doug kiss each other.  They continue talking. \nELLIOT (V.O.) You look very beautiful.  Marriage agrees with you.  Everything that happened between us (pausing) seems more and more hazy. \nAs Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight ahead.  The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks over the scene. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I acted like such a fool.  I don't know what came over me.  That complete conviction that I couldn't live without you. \nThe film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still talking animatedly and smiling.  Lee gently pushes back Doug's hair. \nELLIOT (V.O.) What did I put us both through? And Hannah... \nThe camera moves back to Elliot. \nELLIOT (V.O.) (continuing) ...who as you once said, I love much more than I realized. \nAfter pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door. One boy opens it, revealing Holly.  She joyfully enters the apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss. \nHOLLY (kissing the children) Hi!  How are you! (kissing) Happy Thanksgiving! (kissing) \nBOY #1 Hi! \nHOLLY I didn't miss dinner, did I? \nCHILDREN (overlapping, talking at once) No! \nThe jazz ends as the record scratches and stops.  Evan's rendition of \"Isn't It Romantic\" is heard on the piano as Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder, walks towards the living room.  She is stopped by three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a man--who are coming out of the room. \nHOLLY (smiling) Huh?  Hi, Marge. \nFEMALE GUEST #1 (overlapping) You look lovely. \nThey kiss. \nFEMALE GUEST #2 (overlapping, hugging Holly) Hello, darling. \nHOLLY Happy Thanksgiving. \nFEMALE GUEST #2 (overlapping) Good to see you.  Same to you. \nHOLLY (hugging the man) Hello. \nThe movie cuts to Hannah, leaning contentedly against a doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen Evan play the piano.  Elliot, holding his drink, walks over to her.  They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him.  She leans her head on his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel.  They look offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few guests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano.  Norma sits at his side, one arm resting on the piano.  She holds a drink and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to \"Isn't It Romantic.\" \nThe camera then moves to the doorway in the living room, where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy crowd.  Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song. A child plays near the coffee table. \nThe camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den. Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small chair by the sofa.  He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters the room and crouches down next to him, smiling.  She waves to him.  He waves back as the camera continues to move past the doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway mirror, fixing her earrings.  Mavis can be seen in the background, through the doorway into the dining room, lighting the candles on the table.  She dims the lights, darkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a warm candlelit glow.  Mavis leaves the dining room and passes Holly. \nHOLLY (still fixing her earrings, to Mavis) It's beautiful. \nMavis walks off.  Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins fluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around her from behind.  The camera stays focused on the mirror; both Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection. \nMICKEY (smacking his lips) Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband. \nHOLLY (grinning) Hi. \nMICKEY Hi. (kissing Holly) How you doin'? \nHOLLY (nestling against Mickey) Okay. \nMICKEY When'd you get here? \nHOLLY Just a few minutes ago. \nMICKEY Oh. (kissing her again) You look so beautiful. \nMickey continues to kiss Holly.  She responds, sighing and closing her eyes. \nHOLLY Thanks. \n", "test3_id": 14}

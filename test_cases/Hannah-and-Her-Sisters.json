{"train": "LEE (turning towards the sink) Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here. \nHOLLY (puffing on her cigarette) God. \nHANNAH (scooping out some cantaloupe seeds) Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around. \nHOLLY (to Lee, laughing) I should get a garter belt. \nLEE (laughing) Yeah. \nHOLLY (looking down at herself) Get a garter belt... (sipping her drink) Get a garter belt and flirt. \nLEE (laughing, to Hannah) Where are the antihistamines? \nHANNAH Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere. \nLEE (nodding) Okay. \nLee leaves the kitchen.  Holly, puffing on her cigarette, watches her go. \nHOLLY (sighing) Frederick didn't come with her. \nHANNAH (turning to Holly, still working at the sink) When does Frederick ever come with her? \nHOLLY (whispering intently) Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out! \nHannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink. \nAnd the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing.  The camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands. \nEVAN & NORMA (singing) \"A pill he is But still he is All mine and I'll Keep him until he is Bewitched, a'both--\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver.  Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey.  Behind her is Holly, carrying a casserole.  Hannah's parents can still be heard singing in the background. \nHANNAH (to the children) Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep! \nHOLLY (overlapping) Oh, your kids are so adorable. \nCHILDREN (walking through the doorway) Bye!  Bye! \nHOLLY (putting down her bowl on the table) God, it gets so lonely on the holidays. \nHANNAH (setting down the turkey on the opposite end of the table) Oh, gosh.  Well, you know, that's why I invited Phil Gammage tonight. \nAs the sisters talk, the piano music stops.  There's the sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly heard in the dining room. \nHOLLY (grimacing, reacting to Hannah) Oh, Hannah! \nHANNAH (overlapping) It's, uh, you never know-- \nHOLLY (interrupting, gesturing) He's such a loser! \nHANNAH He's not a loser at all! \nHOLLY (shaking her head) Oh, he's such a loser! \nHANNAH (overlapping, lighting a set of candles on the table) He's the headmaster of Daisy's school. \nHOLLY Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. (moving her hand up and down her throat) His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH (laughing) Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job. (handing a pack of matches to Holly) Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything. \nHOLLY (striking a match to light another set of candles) Give me a break. \nAPRIL (offscreen) Am I interrupting... \nThe film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink. \nAPRIL (continuing) ...any sister talk? \nHANNAH (offscreen) Mm-mm! \nHOLLY (offscreen) Come in. \nThe camera moves with April as she walks over to the table, where Hannah and Holly are lighting candles. \nAPRIL Oh, good... \nHANNAH (overlapping, still offscreen) Come in, come in. \nAPRIL (gesturing) ...because there are no interesting single men at this party! \nHANNAH (now onscreen) Oh, listen... \nHOLLY (interrupting, waving out her match) I know.  It's terrible! \nAPRIL (shaking her head) I mean, I've looked everywhere. \nHANNAH (picking at the turkey and gesturing) Maybe April would like Phil.  Phil Gammage, the tall guy in there by the piano. \nHolly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods. \nAPRIL (pointing to herself) Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil. \nHANNAH (looking at April, nodding) Mmm? \nAPRIL He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane? \nHannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes.  Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away. \nAPRIL (laughing with the sisters, gesturing) I love that.  That's my type. \nHANNAH (shaking her head, laughing) I can't believe it! \nShe walks over to a nearby china cabinet. \nEveryone is seated around the table for Thanksgiving dinner. Facing the camera are Holly, Lee, Norma, and Hannah.  She sits to the left of Elliot, who's at the head of the table. On his right is Evan; April sits next to him.  She and the other guests sit with their backs to the screen.  The table overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles.  In the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid serves them turkey.  The guests chatter comfortably among themselves as they eat. \nEVAN (clanking a piece of silverware against his water glass) Now, ladies and gentlemen... \nHOLLY (making a face) Dad. \nEvan continues to clank his glass to get everyone's attention. \nHOLLY Dad... \nLEE (reacting, to Holly) Oh... \nHOLLY Dad! \nEVAN (still clanking) No, now... \nHOLLY I'm starving! \nResigned, Holly puts down her silverware.  Lee smothers a laugh.  Norma, reacting, glances at Holly and Lee.  Everyone knows what's coming. \nEVAN (clanking away) ...this is a toast!  This is a toast. \nHANNAH (reaching across the table for Evan's wine glass, laughing) Get his wine away. \nEVAN This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all... \nHolly laughs.  Lee glances over to her, reacting.  Hannah, embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face. Lee and the rest of the guests put down their silverware. They look at Evan, listening. \nEVAN ...prepared...by Hannah. \nHannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign. \nHANNAH (modestly pointing to the maid) Uh, and a little help... \nLee and Holly try to suppress their laughter.  Norma glares at them. \nNORMA (to her daughters) Hey! \nHANNAH (continuing) ...from Mavis, also. \nElliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him affectionately and kisses her on the cheek.  She hugs him back. \nELLIOT (hugging Hannah) You bet. \nHANNAH (overlapping, looking down the table while still in Elliot's embrace) Holly and April, thanks for helping. \nMavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts to cheer and applaud.  Holly waves her napkin at April, then holds up her wine glass. \nEVAN (overlapping the noise) No, you did it. \nHOLLY (overlapping, toasting her friend) April, April! \nHANNAH (overlapping, gesturing) I am... I did slave all day. \nEVAN (overlapping, holding out his wine glass) And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House! \nThe group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah.  She reacts, smiling but embarrassed. \nNORMA (overlapping, laughing) Ya-a-a-a-y! (laughing) I played Nora.  I hate to tell you what year... \nThe guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues to speak.  Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their laughter.  Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food to the children. \nNORMA (continuing) And it's very difficult to behave like Torvald's little chipmunk without making a perfect ass out of yourself! (pausing while the guests laugh heartily) Now I think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah! \nNorma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her.  The applause and cheers begin anew.  Hannah, reacting, chuckles. \nAPRIL (overlapping the applause and clapping loudly) Speech!  Speech!  Speech! \nNORMA (overlapping) Yea-a-a-a-ah! \nA few guests sip their wine.  They all quiet down as Hannah starts her speech, glancing around the table and gesturing. \nHANNAH (reacting) I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy (banging her fists lightly on the table) but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage... \nEVAN (nodding) Yeah. \nHANNAH (overlapping) ...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest. \nHannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the table.  He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with equal tenderness. \nEVAN (chuckling) Oh, bravo!  Bravo! \nHannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate.  The group applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding their approval. \nCUT TO: \n\"We all had a terrific time.\" \nClassical string music plays as the film cuts to: \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT \nA taxi moves down Broadway towards the camera, passing a truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen, the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the taxi's backseat.  Lee sits by the window, leaning her head in her hand, a reflective look on her face.  Her voice is heard over the screen. \nLEE (V.O.) Is it my imagination, or does Elliot have a little crush on me? (chuckling slightly) It's funny.  I've had that thought before.  He pays a lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were alone in the bedroom.  I wonder if he and Hannah are happy?  It's funny, I...I still feel a little buzz from his flirting. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT \nLee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers.  She walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee. \nLEE (to an offscreen Frederick) Want some coffee or tea? \nFREDERICK (offscreen) No, thank you. \nLee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, two columns.  Lamps hang down from the ceiling. The classical music still plays in the background.  Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area.  Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen. \nLARRY We're short!  The show is five minutes short! \nThe group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen.  As they scurry off, their voices are heard. \nMICKEY How could it be short?  We timed everything (offscreen) long. \nPAUL (offscreen) If we have to... \nThey are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards the camera.  The corridor is crowded with busy TV personnel. The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past them.  One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks; she looks back at him briefly. \nPAUL (continuing) ...pull out the sketch, then we'll be ten minutes short! \nMICKEY (gesturing) I don't know how they can do that to us.  That's-- We go on in thirty minutes, right? \nMary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor. \nLARRY (squeezing past several passersby) They're doing it because our ratings are low. \nMICKEY (nervously rubbing his forehead) I got such a migraine. \nAs the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses. \nGAIL (offscreen) Hey, Mickey! \nGail runs in front of the group.  Without missing a step, she faces Mickey and walks backwards, gesturing and talking frantically. \nGAIL Mickey!  Listen, we better go right to Ronny's dressing room.  This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes.  I don't think he's going to be able to do the show! \nThe fast-tracking group turns the corner.  Gail pats Mickey's back; she gestures in exasperation. \nMICKEY (gesturing towards heaven) Why me, Lord?  What did I-- \nHe is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey.  Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel. \nMICKEY You-- (pointing) Standards and Practices? \nED Ed Smythe, yes. \nMICKEY Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? (putting his hands on his hips) \nED (gesturing) Child molestation is a touchy subject... \nMICKEY (overlapping, looking at Gail) Could you-- \nED (continuing) ...with the affiliates. \nMICKEY (overlapping and grunting) Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it! \nED (pointing at Mickey) Yes, but you name names. \nMICKEY (gesturing) We nev-- We don't name names! (turning to Gail for support, briefly touching her shoulders, then looking back at Ed) We say the Pope. \nGAIL (gesturing emphatically) We always say the Pope! \nED That sketch... \nMICKEY (overlapping) We-- \nED (continuing) ...cannot go on the air. \nA writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around. \nMICKEY Oh, Je-- \nWRITER (interrupting, shouting) Hey! \nMickey, Gail, and Ed turn towards the writer. \nWRITER (angrily, slapping his script) Who changed my sketch about the PLO? \nMickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis. \nMICKEY (gesturing) I had to make some cuts.  It's four lousy lines! \nWRITER The whole premise is ruined! \nMickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio. \nMICKEY (gesturing, trying to calm the writer down) Oh, you're crazy!  It's not so delicate.  Everybody's married to every line. \nThe writer reacts angrily.  Gail tries to get Mickey's attention as they walk. \nGAIL (tapping Mickey's shoulder) Mickey, I can-- \nWRITER (interrupting, angrily gesturing) I don't care!  I don't want anyone tampering with my goddamn work without telling me! \nMICKEY (shrugging) Okay. \nWRITER (pointing angrily) You want 'em cut?!  I'll cut 'em myself! \nMickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer.  He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor. \nMICKEY (shrugging, distracted) All right, all right. (muttering) \nGAIL (overlapping, trying to get Mickey's attention and gesturing) Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen. \nMICKEY (distractedly, his mind still on the writer) You know... (muttering as the writer passes him and walks away) \nGAIL (overlapping, gesturing) In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number? \nMICKEY (still distracted, looking off) No-- \nRON (overlapping) I don't feel good, Mickey. \nMickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room.  Gail follows him.  Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron. They share a drink in a paper cup.  The woman looks back at Ron; she gestures with disgust. \nMICKEY (gesturing) Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do? Swallow a drugstore?! \nMICKEY (overlapping, gesturing) H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me... \nHANNAH (overlapping, chuckling) I know, I know. \nMICKEY (overlapping) ...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person... \nHANNAH (overlapping, touching the mitt and reacting) That's really nice! \nMICKEY (still rambling on, gesturing to Hannah) ...you know?  I, uh... \nHANNAH (overlapping) You know, he's been wanting a mitt. \nShe helps Twin #2 open his present.  It's a football. \nMICKEY You've always had good taste in husbands, so... \nHANNAH (chuckling and nodding) Thanks, thanks. \nMICKEY Mh-hm. \nHANNAH (leaning down to look at the football) That's a beauty! \nMICKEY Isn't that great? \nHANNAH Oh! \nMICKEY (pointing, to Twin #2) Go right over there. \nHANNAH Football! \nTwin #2, panting, runs offscreen to catch the football. \nMICKEY (to the offscreen twin) Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go! \nHANNAH (looking offscreen at twin #2) Wow! \nMICKEY (still pointing, gearing up for the pass) Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this. \nMickey throws the football. \nMICKEY See? (whistling) \nHANNAH (pointing offscreen) Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture. \nThere's a sound of breaking glass.  Hannah and Mickey react. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY \nMickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his coat pockets.  Jazz plays in the background as he talks over the screen. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Gee, Hannah's sweet.  Although, sometimes I still do get angry when I think of things.  Oh, what the hell.  At least, I'm not paying child support. (sighing) Oh, God, I hope there's nothing physically wrong with me, either. \nMickey pushes open the outside door of Dr. Abel's office, as the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room.  The doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet. \nDR. ABEL (taking out Mickey's file) So what's the, uh, problem this time? \nMICKEY (offscreen) This time I really think I have something. \nWhile Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and walks toward him.  The camera follows the doctor's movements from the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly. \nIt moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to the offscreen Dr. Abel. \nMICKEY (onscreen) I mean, I'm absolutely convinced that-that-- You know, I mean, it's not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where I didn't realize I had them out. \nDr. Abel walks back onscreen.  Both he and Mickey are now seen through the second doorway.  Dr. Abel sniffs and stands directly in front of the sitting Mickey.  He stares down at him as Mickey talks. \nMICKEY (continuing, gesturing) So, so, but it was when I was younger, so-- \nDR. ABEL (overlapping, interrupting) You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus... \nMICKEY (folding his arms on his chest) Mm-hm. \nDR. ABEL (continuing) ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains. \nMICKEY Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's-- \nDR. ABEL (interrupting) You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness. \nMICKEY (rubbing his hands on his knees) Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear (poking at his ears and gesturing) ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear. \nDr. Abel chuckles. \nMICKEY (nodding and gesturing) Now I ca-can't remember. \nDR. ABEL Let's take a look. \nAn uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey. Next is a hearing test.  The film shows the doctors's hands turning the dials on a sonometer.  Mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head.  He listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes.  He holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset. Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large turning fork with his finger.  He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's ear.  Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods. \nThe music stops as the film cuts back to Dr. Abel's consultation room.  Dr. Abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way.  He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks. \nDR. ABEL Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear. \nMICKEY (offscreen) Really?! \nDr. Abel moves offscreen in the second examining room.  The camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor and Mickey talk offscreen. \nDR. ABEL (offscreen) Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus? \nMICKEY (offscreen) No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me. \nDr. Abel briefly passes by the doorway. \nMICKEY (offscreen) I always, I-I always imagine that I have things. \nDR. ABEL (offscreen) When did you first notice this? \nGAIL (impatiently) Mickey, come on, we got a show to do! \nMICKEY (pacing) I can't keep my mind on the show. \nGAIL (offscreen) But there's nothing wrong with you. \nMICKEY (sighing and gesturing) If there's nothing wrong with me (pacing back to the desk and Gail) then why does he want me to come back for tests?! \nGAIL (gesturing) Well, he has to rule out certain things. (sighing) \nMICKEY Like what?!  What? \nGAIL (shrugging) I don't know.  Cancer, I-- \nMICKEY (interrupting) Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word! (gesturing) Don't mention that while I'm in the building. \nGAIL (gesturing) But you don't have any symptoms! \nMICKEY (gesturing) You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor! \nMickey sighs. \nGAIL Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma. \nMICKEY (gesturing) Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back! \nGAIL It was on your shirt! \nMICKEY (sighing) I--How was I to know?! (pointing to his back) Everyone was pointing back here. \nHe sighs again as Gail, frustrated, gestures impatiently to the papers on the desk. \nGAIL Come on, we've got to make some booking decisions. \nMickey begins pacing around the room again.  He wrings his hands and blows on them. \nMICKEY I can't.  I can't think of it. This morning, I was so happy, you know.  Now I, I don't know what went wrong. (sighing) \nGAIL Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious... \nMICKEY (pacing back to the desk, still wringing his hands) No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy. \nCUT TO: \nThe Stanislavski Catering Company in action. \nSophisticated pop music plays as the film cuts to: \nINT. LOFT - DAY \nAn abstract painting on a wall fills the screen.  Light laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music; offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly. \nFEMALE BRUNCH GUEST (offscreen) These things are delicious!  What in the world are they? \nHolly walks onto the screen in front of the painting.  She holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a uniform. \nHOLLY Oh, um, those are quail eggs. \nFEMALE BRUNCH GUEST (offscreen) Oh, they're very good. \nHolly walks past the painting towards the female brunch guest.  A man walks in front of her.  Chatter, light laughter, and music are still heard; a party is in progress. \nHOLLY (nodding) Yeah, my friend April makes those. (holding out the tray) Here, try the shrimp puffs.  These are delicious. \nFEMALE BRUNCH GUEST (taking one from the tray) Oh, thank you.  That looks great. \nHOLLY I make those. \nFEMALE BRUNCH GUEST Mmm.  Thanks. \nHolly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman. Holding her tray, she passes a large oval loft window and several clusters of brunch guests.  They are eating and drinking.  No one pays any attention to her. \nHOLLY (to two male guests in her way) Excuse me. \nOne of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as Holly passes. \nHOLLY (to the man) Thank you. \nHolly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen. Her tray is empty. \nAPRIL (offscreen) The Stroganoff is ready. \nHolly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the Stroganoff out of the oven.  She wears the same uniform as Holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie. \nHOLLY (animatedly) We're a big hit. \nAPRIL Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit. \nApril, holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests.  Holly calls after her, offscreen, as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen. \nHOLLY (offscreen) You will be.  You will be.  You'll get five jobs next week. \nDavid walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan- covered stove. \nDAVID (to Holly) Excuse me, are there any more claims? \nHOLLY (gesturing at some canap\u00e9s warming on the stove) Only a few.  A few. (chuckling as David takes one) Do you like 'em? \nDAVID I can't resist. \nHOLLY (busily working at the stove) Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs? \nDAVID (eating a canap\u00e9 and pointing at Holly) Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong. \nHOLLY We're actresses. \nDAVID Is this your first job? \nAPRIL (overlapping) Oh, is that what it is? \nHOLLY (starting to speak) Uh-- APRIL (interrupting, nodding at Holly) I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know. \nHOLLY (nodding, overlapping) Right. \nAPRIL (looking back at the building with reverence) It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes. \nDAVID (turning to April, emphatically) You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment. \nAPRIL (shaking her head) Oh-- \nHOLLY (interrupting, gesturing and nodding) Oh, it's really important. \nDavid turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back to April. \nAPRIL (looking only at David) What are your favorite buildings, David? \nDAVID You want to see some? \nAPRIL (nodding) Oh, yeah. \nDAVID Well, let's do it. \nAPRIL (looking at David) Great. \nDavid starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through New York City's landmark buildings, as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar. Inspiring classical music plays in the background. \nThe series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth Street, the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building, Abigail Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side.  The group can be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row houses and shrubbery.  A lamppost sits in the foreground. \nIt is now dark.  The music continues to play as the film cuts to the fa\u00e7ade of a rococo-style building, complete with French doors and ornate windows.  The admiring group is heard offscreen. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown... \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Yes. \nHOLLY (offscreen, continuing) ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony -- \nAPRIL (offscreen, interrupting) It's French, though.  It really is. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Yeah. \nAPRIL (offscreen, overlapping) It feels like you're in France. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) It-it is.  It's romantic. \nThe music stops.  The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's fa\u00e7ade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it. \nDAVID (offscreen) And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Yeah. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then... \nThe film moves from the two elegant fa\u00e7ade to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs. \nAPRIL (offscreen) That's just -- \nDAVID (offscreen, interrupting) Look at this. \nHOLLY (offscreen) That's disgusting! \nAPRIL (offscreen, continuing) ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that? \nHOLLY (offscreen, overlapping) It's really terrible. \nDAVID (offscreen, emphatically) It's really sad. \nHOLLY (offscreen) And it ruins everything else. \nDAVID (offscreen, agreeing) It does. \nThe film moves from the ugly fa\u00e7ade to the building's equally ugly entrance.  A large car is parked right in front of the building. \nAPRIL (offscreen) Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though. \nHOLLY (offscreen, chuckling) Yeah. \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Yeah. \nAPRIL (offscreen, overlapping) A lot of works. \nThe group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly fa\u00e7ades across the way.  David is in the lead; the women follow, Holly slightly behind April. \nHOLLY (nodding) Yeah. \nDAVID (glancing at his watch) Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? \nHOLLY Fast. \nAPRIL Oh, geez, yeah. \nHOLLY (overlapped) Okay. \nThey walk towards the car. \nDAVID (looking back at the women as he walks around the car to the driver's side) Uh, who gets dropped first? \nAPRIL Uh -- \nHOLLY (overlapping, looking at April) Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um... \nDAVID (offscreen, overlapping) Well... \nAPRIL (overlapping) Well, I live downtown. \nHOLLY (glancing at April) Yeah, I, we both live downtown. \nShe shrugs. \nELLIOT I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful. \nLEE (laughing) Oh, God. \nELLIOT (overlapping, chuckling) I think to myself (laughing) what problems could she possibly have? \nLEE (gesturing, laughing) Don't let me get started on my childhood. (stopping in her tracks, remembering) Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore. \nELLIOT (stopping alongside her) Yes? LEE (overlapping, pointing) A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. \nELLIOT Yes? \nLEE (nodding) Yeah, you would. \nELLIOT (looking around for a moment, then gesturing to Lee) Well, i-if-if you have some free time... \nLEE (nodding) Yeah, sure. (chuckling) \nELLIOT Thank you. \nThey begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf- like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books.  A piano playing \"Bewitched\" is heard.  Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. \nLEE (offscreen) Isn't this great? (chuckling) They have everything here. \nELLIOT (offscreen, distracted) Yes, it's-it's wonderful. \nLEE (offscreen) What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT (offscreen) What?  Book? \nLEE (offscreen) Your book?  You wanted to buy a book? \nThe camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, book?  Oh, no, I... (laughing) I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh... \nLEE (looking up at a row of books) Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read. \nShe walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee. \nLEE No, I don't have time. \nLee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing.  She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. \nELLIOT (gesturing) No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I... \nLEE (offscreen, chuckling) You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay? \nELLIOT (overlapping) No!  No... \nLEE (offscreen) No? \nELLIOT (gesturing, looking at books) Uh, yes! \nLEE (offscreen) Yes? \nElliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up.  He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row. \nELLIOT (offscreen momentarily, hidden by a shelf as he talks) Yes. \nLEE (offscreen) Everything's okay? (chuckling) \nELLIOT Yeah.  How are you? \nLEE (offscreen) I'm...all right. \nELLIOT (offscreen momentarily, hidden by another shelf as he walks) How-how's Frederick? \nElliot stops walking to browse through some books. \"Bewitched\" still plays. \nLEE (offscreen) Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio? \nELLIOT (turning to talk to the offscreen Lee) Oh, yes.  Who doesn't? (pointing) Look! \nElliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. \nELLIOT (pointing to a book on a shelf, continuing) e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this. \nLEE (offscreen, laughing) Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much. \nELLIOT (pulling the book off the shelf and browsing through it) Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much. \nLEE (offscreen) No, I don't think so. \nELLIOT (gesturing with the book, looking at the offscreen Lee) I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. (nervously laughing, trying to correct his mistake) A poem of (laughing) his and thought of you last-- (laughing) You'll be fine, though. (chuckling) Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book. \nLEE (overlapping) Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this. \nELLIOT (overlapping, patting the book) Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this. \nLEE (looking down at the book) Well, sure. \nELLIOT (overlapping) And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime. \nHe hands Lee the book.  She thumbs through it, as the movie cuts to: \nThe street outside the bookstore.  Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. \nLEE (laughing, holding up the bag) Well, thanks a lot. \nELLIOT (pointing to the bookstore) Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. \nLEE (nodding) Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time. (stepping closer to the curb and hailing a cab) I know you would. \nELLIOT (pointing to the book) And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you. \nDR. SMITH (offscreen) I'm afraid not. \nMICKEY Well, I gotta get a second opinion. \nHANNAH (turning to Mickey) This is the second opinion. \nMICKEY (shrugging) Well, then a third opinion. \nDr. Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down.  As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face. \nDR. SMITH I realize this is a blow.  My experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem.  I hope you won't make too much of it.  One can adopt children, and there are various artificial methods of fertilization. \nCUT TO: EXT. GROVE STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY \nMickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians.  Hannah, crying, blows her nose. \nMICKEY (gesturing) I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean-- \nHANNAH (interrupting, wiping her eyes with her tissue) Could you have ruined yourself somehow? \nMICKEY (gesturing) How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself? \nHANNAH (overlapping, looking at Mickey) I don't know.  Excessive masturbation? \nMICKEY Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus! \nHannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face. \nMICKEY Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one-- \nHANNAH (interrupting) Well, what about artificial insemination? \nMICKEY (gesturing) What are you talking about? \nHANNAH (overlapping) You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor. \nMICKEY (reacting) What, by a st-stranger? \nDeep in conversation, they cross a tree-lined street.  They pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron fence. \nHANNAH Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen. \nMICKEY (gesturing) Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea? \nHANNAH I want to experience childbirth. \nMICKEY With a, with a stranger?  With a-- \nHANNAH (interrupting, sniffing) Just think about it.  That's all I ask. \nThey walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room.  The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants.  Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee. \nCAROL (putting down her cup) Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote. \nNORMAN (holding his cup, pointing emphatically) No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for. \nMickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate.  The sun pours through the windows he passes.  Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen. \nMICKEY Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far as laughs, I mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did. \nMickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins. \nNORMAN (agreeing) Mm-hm. \nCAROL (overlapping, her hands over her crossed knees and nodding) Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm. \nMickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch.  He rubs his forehead. \nNORMAN (to Carol, gesturing with his cup) We got that idea on that trip to Paris. \nCAROL (nodding) Right. \nNORMAN (smiling) Hmm? \nCAROL (to the offscreen Hannah) Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks. \nNorman chuckles. \nMICKEY (sighing, almost mumbling) Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess we had fun when we were there and, you know, it's just, I-- \nNORMAN (overlapping, nodding) Mm-hm. \nHannah walks over to the group, holding a pot of coffee. She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman and Carol. \nHANNAH (to Mickey) Sorry. (to Norman and Carol) Coffee?  Listen, you guys, we were-- You want some more? \nNORMAN (holding out his cup) Mmm. \nHANNAH (refilling Norman's cup) We-we...we had something we-we really wanted to discuss with you. \nMICKEY (overlapping, coughing) Yeah... \nHannah refills Carol's cup.  She puts the pot down on the coffee table and sits down next to Mickey. \nMICKEY (standing up and gesturing) Jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and-and I only bring this up amongst friends, you know. \nHe starts to pace.  Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol. \nMICKEY (turning to the group as he paces behind the couch) I mean... (grunting) this is, uh... this should not go any further than this room. \nNORMAN (sipping his coffee) I'm all ears. \nHannah sighs.  Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts. \nMICKEY (gesturing and pacing) Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- (gesturing) It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to-- \nHANNAH (interrupting, nervously picking at her fingers) W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination. \nLEE (looking at an offscreen Frederick, gesturing) Big.  Frederick, show him the oils. \nFREDERICK (offscreen) They're in the basement. \nThe camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door.  Frederick follows at a distance. \nLEE (to Dusty) Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love. \nDUSTY (overlapping, muttering) Well, are...are they big? \nLEE Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big. \nDUSTY 'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. (chuckling) \nFREDERICK (angrily stopping in his tracks) I don't sell my work by the yard! \nLEE (chuckling, reacting) Oh, Frederick! \nThe camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft.  He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee. \nELLIOT (chuckling softly) How's everything? \nLEE (walking onscreen towards Elliot) Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend. \nELLIOT Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. \nLEE (nodding, her arms clasped around her chest) Oh, yeah. \nELLIOT (chuckling) But I go nuts.  It's a conflict. \nHe laughs.  Lee, uneasy, looks down. \nLEE I have to get my teeth cleaned this week. \nELLIOT Oh, that's nice. \nThere's an awkward moment of silence. \nELLIOT (breaking the silence, pointing in the direction of the door) I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together. \nLEE (looking in the same direction, gesturing) Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you. \nELLIOT Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars. \nLEE (nodding, wrapping her arms around her chest again) Oh. \nELLIOT He's got like six gold records. \nLEE (gesturing, relieved that she's found something to say) Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended... \nThe camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf. \nLEE (continuing) ...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that I think you'd love.  It's a... another Bach, second movement. \nShe pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, you-you have that one? \nLEE (working at the stereo, turning her head towards Elliot) Yeah. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, I would love to hear it. \nBach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room. \nLEE (putting the turntable cover in place) Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. (chuckling) \nThe record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit.  She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. \nLEE (intently) Isn't that beautiful? \nELLIOT (looking at Lee, his hands clasped in front of him) I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites. \nLee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. \nELLIOT (after a pause) Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings? \nLEE (wrapping her arms around her chest and looking away from Elliot for a moment) Yes, he's just adorable. \nElliot nods. \nLEE (awkwardly) They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS. \nELLIOT (taking a breath) Oh, right. \nThere is another moment of silence.  Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest.  The harpsichord plays on. \nELLIOT (softly) Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve? \nLEE Yes, it made me cry (tentatively looking at Elliot) it was so beautiful...so romantic. \nLee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I want so badly to kiss her.  Not here, you idiot.  You've got to get her alone someplace. \nAs Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away.  The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. \nELLIOT (V.O.) But I've got to proceed cautiously. This is a very delicate situation. Okay, uh...ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow. \nLee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. \nELLIOT (V.O.) And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically. \nLEE (showing Elliot a poem in her book) Did you ever read this one--? \nElliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. \nELLIOT But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you? \nLEE (reacting uneasily) I can't say anything! \nELLIOT W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad. \nLEE (putting her hand to her head) Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right? \nLee looks at him. \nELLIOT (gesturing) O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out. \nLEE Look, don't do anything on my behalf. (shaking her head) I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close. \nELLIOT Yes, but you, you do care about me. \nLEE (reacting) Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street! \nShe sighs. \nELLIOT (emphatically) Your guilt is because you feel the same. \nLEE (reacting) Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned. \nShe walks off.  Elliot stares after her, grinning. \nELLIOT (happily) I have my answer.  I have my answer! I'm walking on air! \nHe laughs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET CORNER OUTSIDE EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nA taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning.  It's an overcast day. \nA station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab.  She runs into the building; the taxi drives away.  A piano plays \"Bewitched\" over the screen. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEvan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah. \nHANNAH (distracted) Hi.  How's she doing? \nEVAN (overlapping) I am glad to see you. \nHannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen.  He passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed photographs. \nEVAN She's in the kitchen there.  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  She promises, promises. (gesturing) But it's all lies. \nThrough a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen.  She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking.  Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in. \nHANNAH (offscreen, patiently) Don't make it worse, Dad. \nEVAN (overlapping) Always. \nHannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen; her mother takes a sip of her drink. \nHANNAH Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that. (taking away her mother's drink, to Evan) What triggered it? \nEVAN (gesturing, as Norma turns her head and watches him) We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman... \nNorma reacts, turning to her daughter.  Hannah, however, has her back turned.  She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks.  She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water. \nEVAN (continuing) ...and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him, that he was just embarrassed by her-- \nNORMA (angrily interrupting, turning her head) Liar!  Liar! \nThe camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den. \nEVAN Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker (shouting over his shoulder) and finally she became Joan Collins! \nEvan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top.  He picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen. \nNORMA (offscreen) All my life I've had to put up with insults... \nThe camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks.  She is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before.  She holds the water glass and the pills. NORMA (continuing, dramatically) ...from this non-person, this, th- th-this haircut that passes for a man. (turning to look at the offscreen Hannah) He could never support us.  It's a good thing we had a talented daughter! \nEvan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry.  As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano. \nEVAN I can only hope that she was mine. With you as her mother (gesturing, his voice getting louder) her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity! \nNORMA She's talented...so it's not likely she's yours! (taking a sip of water) \nHANNAH (walking over to the doorway to speak to Evan, who's already fuming in the den) Dad, could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her? \nHannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away. \nEVAN (offscreen, choosing to ignore Hannah's suggestion) You never know when she's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody. \nHannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup. \nHANNAH Here, Mom.  Drink this. (leaning against a kitchen counter) You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting. \nNORMA (sipping her coffee) No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart. \nHANNAH You promised to stay on the wagon. \nNORMA (shaking her head) The sacrifices I've made because of that man. (inhaling) He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his-- (gesturing) his-his-his-his mediocrity! \nHANNAH Okay, stop being so dramatic. \nNORMA (shouting to the offscreen Evan) He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock! \nHANNAH (quietly) Okay, okay. \nMICKEY No, I'm not dying now, but, but (gesturing) you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow. (pointing) But eventually, I'm going to be in that position. \nGail gets up from her chair.  She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet.  She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something.  The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly. \nGAIL You're just realizing this now? \nMICKEY (offscreen) Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind... \nAs Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk. \nMICKEY ...because it-it's a very horrible thing to... think about! \nGail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum. She slams it closed, distracted. \nGAIL (muttering) Yeah.  What? \nMICKEY (turning to Gail) Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret? \nGAIL (nodding impatiently as she walks around the desk) Yes, please. \nMICKEY (pointing) A week ago, I bought a rifle. \nGAIL (sitting on the arm of a chair near Mickey) No. \nMICKEY (overlapping, nodding and gesturing) I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath. \nGAIL (shrugging, unwrapping a stick of gum) Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us. \nMICKEY Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything... \nGail sighs.  She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey continues to speak. \nMICKEY (continuing) ...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything. (gesturing, pointing) I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything! \nGAIL (chewing) I know, I know, and your hamster. \nMICKEY (nodding emphatically) Yes! \nGAIL (chewing and pointing to Mickey) Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap. \nMickey sighs. \nGAIL (continuing, chewing loudly) Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No? \nMICKEY (shaking his head, his hand to his chest) I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise (pausing and holding his head) I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic. \nCUT TO: \nThe entrance to the St. Regis Hotel, elegant and warmly lit in the night.  Pedestrians pass.  Baroque harpsichord music plays over the scene.  The camera moves up the hotel's fa\u00e7ade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. \nAs the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside, to one of the hotel rooms.  Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee. \nElliot closes the door behind her as she enters.  They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall. \nELLIOT (looking intensely at Lee, his hands in his pockets) I thought you weren't coming. \nLEE I almost didn't. \nELLIOT (putting his hand on her shoulder, wanting to kiss her) Lee... uh... \nLEE I didn't sleep all night. \nELLIOT (taking his hand away, gesturing to the room) No, no-no-no, I'm sure. \nThey walk towards the camera, further into the room.  Elliot puts his arm around Lee. \nLEE What are we doing, meeting in a hotel room?  It's terrible, isn't it? \nThe music stops.  The camera follows Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed. \nELLIOT (offscreen) I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks. \nLEE I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called. \nShe parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when Elliot speaks. \nELLIOT (offscreen) I've wanted to call you everyday since I first told you how I felt. \nHe walks over to Lee by the curtained windows. \nELLIOT I resisted so many times. (pausing) Don't think badly of me. \nHe takes Lee into his arms. \nELLIOT This is not an easy situation. \nLEE (whispering) I know it isn't. \nThey kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room.  Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss.  They embrace.  They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter. \nAnd it's later that night.  The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head. \nLEE That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else. \nELLIOT (offscreen) I don't want anyone else ever to have you. \nLEE (sighing) I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah. \nELLIOT (offscreen, laughing) Oh, my God. \nHe enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Lee.  He holds a cigarette. \nELLIOT You really do have those thoughts, don't you? \nLEE (chuckling, touching Elliot's arm) Oh, all the time. \nElliot chuckles; they hold hands. \nFREDERICK So you met somebody else? \nLEE (sighing, nodding) Yeah. \nFrederick cringes, reacting.  He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs. \nLEE (walking into the bathroom) But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this! \nFREDERICK (turning to face Lee in the bathroom, his arms crossed) Who is it? \nLEE (frantically putting things in her purse, glaring at Frederick) What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met! \nFREDERICK But who?  Where did you meet him? \nLEE It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out! \nFREDERICK You are, you are my only connection to the world! \nLee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway. \nLEE (gesturing emotionally) Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late. \nFREDERICK (reacting, his face in his hand) Jesus...Jesus! \nLEE (gesturing, moving closer to Frederick) Oh, God, I don't even know what I want. \nFREDERICK (sighing heavily, reacting) Oh... \nLEE (rubbing Frederick's shoulder tenderly) Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean... (laying her head against his shoulder, sighing deeply) it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that-- \nFrederick furiously shakes Lee away.  He pounds his fist against a cupboard.  Lee, gasping, moves away. \nFREDERICK Please, don't patronize me! \nHe puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee. \nFREDERICK God!  I should have married you years ago when you wanted to!  I should have agreed. \nHe walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen. \nLEE (sighing) Oh, God, don't you know it never would have worked? \nFrederick turns away from Lee.  He begins to pace near the counter. \nFREDERICK I told you, one day you would leave me... (leaning on the counter) for a younger man.  I-- \nHe loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees.  A cupboard with some bric-a-brac is mounted behind the night table, which holds a small, white, warm-glowing lamp and some photographs.  She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses.  His voice is heard over the screen. \nELLIOT (V.O.) What passion today with Lee.  She's a volcano.  It was a totally fulfilling experience... Just as I dreamed it would be. (nodding slightly as he takes off his slippers) That's what it was.  It was like living out a dream...a great dream. (taking off his bathrobe) Now I feel very good and cozy being here next to Hannah.  There's something very lovely and real about Hannah. (tossing his bathrobe aside and lying down on the bed next to Hannah, his hands crossed over his stomach) She gives me a very deep feeling of being part of something.  She's a wonderful woman...and I betrayed her.  She came into my empty life and changed it...and I paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room.  God, I'm despicable. What a cruel and shallow thing to do. (sitting up) I have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy. (anxiously) It can't ever happen again.  I'm not that kind of man...and I value Hannah too much.  I love my wife. Now I've betrayed her.  Oh, God! \nElliot frantically stands up and leaves the room. \nHANNAH (reading, not looking up) Where're you going? \nELLIOT (offscreen) I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman. \nHANNAH (still reading) It's so late. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot. \nElliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway. \nELLIOT (muttering) What if he answers? (turning into the doorway leading to the living room) I'll hang up. (walking into the darkened living room) I'll tell her we can't communicate until I terminate my marriage. (whispering) It's immoral. \nElliot switches on the light.  He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand.  The top of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece of sheet music open on the piano. \nELLIOT (gesturing and whispering) Then, time will pass.  I won't call, and she'll get the idea.  I gotta stop this before I get in too deep.  I'd rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah. \nElliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch. \nELLIOT (whispering, rubbing his hands) It's one-thirty.  She...she can't have a conversation with me...with him around.  I'm getting hysterical. (putting his hands on his hips) I'll call her first thing in the morning.  I'll call her at six. (pointing) Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone.  And I'll, I'll call her and nip it in the bud. \nThe phone rings.  Elliot jumps. \nELLIOT (loudly, to the offscreen Hannah, gasping) I've got it!  I've got it!  I've got it! (picking up the phone, into the telephone) Hello? (loudly, for the offscreen Hannah's benefit) Mel! \nThe movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft.  She talks softly into the telephone. \nLEE (into the telephone) I would have hung up if you hadn't answered and I promise I won't ever do this again, but I just had to tell you, I feel very close to you tonight.  Very, very close. (pausing) Good night. \nLee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room.  Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver. \nCUT TO: \n\"The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless.\" - Tolstoy \nJazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance.  Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths.  He wears his raincoat, his hands are in his pockets.  He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk.  Passersby, some holding books, are seen. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none of 'em knows anything more about the big questions of life than I do.  Ss--I read Socrates. You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to kn-knock off little Greek boys. What the hell's he got to teach me? And, and Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence. He said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity.  Great.  That means I, uh, I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again.  Tch.  It's not worth it. \nThe movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park.  A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by.  The camera moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking by the reservoir.  He continues to talk over the screen. \nMICKEY (V.O.) And, and Freud, another great pessimist.  Jeez, I was in analysis for years.  Nothing happened.  My poor analyst got so frustrated. The guy finally put in a salad bar. \nSeveral joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Oh!  Look at all these people jogging...trying to stave off the inevitable decay of the body.  Boy (smacking his lips) it's so sad what people go through with their-their stationary bike and their exercise and their... (glancing at a fat woman jogger in a red sweatsuit who runs by) ...Oh!  Look at this one!  Poor thing.  My God, she has to tote all that fat around.  Maybe the poets are right.  Maybe love is the only answer. \nMickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir.  He stops walking and looks out over the water. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Shh--Of course, I was in love with Hannah.  That didn't work out too well. (sighing) I even took her sister out. Remember that? \nHOLLY I was so bored! \nMICKEY (gesturing) Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother! \nHOLLY At least I'm open to new concepts! \nMICKEY And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse? \nHOLLY (gesturing) This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed! \nMICKEY Jesus... (waving his arm and whistling for a taxi) I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really. \nA taxi pulls up to the curb.  Mickey and Holly walk up to its rear door. \nHOLLY Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Yeah.  Me, too. \nHOLLY (overlapping) You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Right.  Yeah.  I had a... \nHOLLY (overlapping) God! \nMICKEY (continuing) ...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials. \nHe holds the door open for Holly.  She gets in. \nHOLLY (angrily) Oh, I'll see myself home! \nHolly slams the door.  Mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and several evening-lit store windows. \"I'm In Love Again\" begins to play in the background as Mickey's voice is heard. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Yeah, it was quite an evening. Holly with her cocaine... (chuckling) She should have been wearing a gold shovel around her neck.  Tch, she was polymorphously insensitive, I think. (smacking his lips) Too bad, too... 'cause, you know, I always had a little crush on her. \nBoth a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view.  The music stops and the film cuts to: \nAfternoons. \nA big-band rendition of \"You Made Me Love You\" begins as the film cuts to a hotel room.  Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser.  A TV sits in the corner.  A lamp is on one side of the dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne. Two half-full glasses sit nearby.  Elliot and Lee dance into view.  Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee.  She sips.  Elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser.  They embrace tightly, continuing to dance. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nElliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table. A Christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall.  The family has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate syrup, and a bottle of ketchup.  Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works.  The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves.  Elliot looks listless.  He stares blankly at the table. \nHANNAH (to her adopted children, holding the camera) Oh, you just have to read the instructions.  I mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take pictures underwater. \nCHILD 1 (overlapping) Can I try it? \nHANNAH (handing him the camera) Sure!  Yeah.  When we get to the country, we'll try it in the lake. \nThe child takes the camera from Hannah, as well as picking up a second identical one from the table. \nCHILD 1 Okay. \nHANNAH (resting her chin in her hands) Okay? \nCHILD 2 (overlapping) Can I go? \nCHILD 1 (overlapping) Yeah. \nHANNAH (nodding) Yeah!  Okay. \nThe adopted children leave, the twins going off with them. When they're gone, Hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks at Elliot.  She puts down her cup, still watching him. \nHANNAH (after a beat) Are you in a bad mood? \nELLIOT (shaking his head slightly) I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy. \nThe camera moves in on their faces as they continue to speak. Family photos line the mantel behind Hannah's head. \nHANNAH (intensely) Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me. \nELLIOT (looking down at his hands) Was I? \nHANNAH Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat. \nELLIOT (shaking his head) Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea. \nHANNAH Why not? \nELLIOT (edgily) Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now. \nHANNAH Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong? \nELLIOT I don't know. \nHANNAH Well, tell me.  Should I be worried? \nELLIOT But, you got four children! \nHANNAH I want one with you. \nELLIOT Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle. \nHANNAH But what do, what do you-- (stuttering) what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get? \nELLIOT (gesturing) You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived. \nHANNAH (shaking her head) Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos. \nELLIOT I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take. \nHannah sighs.  Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table. He stands up and begins to pace behind Hannah. \nELLIOT Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. \nHOLLY Well...you know, uh...I sing a little, I mean... (chuckling self-consciously) \nHANNAH (realizing she's hurt Holly, reacting) Ohh! \nHOLLY (overlapping, shaking her head) You know. \nHANNAH (hanging the blouse back on the rack) I know, no-- (chuckling) I know. \nHOLLY (overlapping, still chuckling self- consciously, gesturing) I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I-- \nHANNAH (interrupting, touching her sister's shoulder) No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that. \nThe two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead.  Behind them are some more racks of clothing and a large window with closed venetian blinds. \nHOLLY (gesturing) Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song. \nHANNAH (nodding as she looks around the store, pulling up her shoulder bag strap) Uh-huh. \nHOLLY Easily. \nHolly pauses, looking at her sister.  They continue to walk. \nHOLLY (looking at Hannah) W-why?  You don't think it's realistic? \nHANNAH (putting her hand on Holly's shoulder) No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... (gesturing) hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take... \nHOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Yeah. \nThey walk over to a table laid out with colorful scarves and decorated with hurricane lamps bordering its edges. \nHANNAH (continuing, looking at some clothes hanging beneath the table) ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something? \nHOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. (chuckling and gesturing) \nHANNAH (overlapping, looking at the clothes) I hope. \nHolly looks at her sister for a beat. \nHOLLY (sighing) Boy, you really know how to cut me down. \nHANNAH (looking at Holly, reacting) What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything? \nHOLLY (gesturing) Tch, well, I sing! (suddenly shouting) For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing! \nA female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away. \nHANNAH (overlapping, reacting to her sister's outburst) Okay! (looking at her sister) Okay.  I-- What happened?  You know, we were having a really nice time, a-and suddenly, everything went to bad feeling. \nShe walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. \nHOLLY (shaking her head) Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why. \nHANNAH (gesturing) Look, everything's going your way. \nShe walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. \nHOLLY You're right. (pausing) I'm happy. (shrugging, looking at the offscreen Hannah) Why must I let my insecurities spoil everything? \nHolly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEATER - DAY \nA group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage.  She is singing \"I'm Old- Fashioned,\" accompanied by a piano. \nHOLLY (offscreen, singing softly) \"This year's fancies Are passing fancies...\" \nThe film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song.  A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. \nHOLLY (continuing her singing, barely moving her body) \"But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands I'm old-fashioned And I don't mind it It's how I want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me.\" \nThe camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience.  As it passes the empty audience seats, they are heard offscreen. \nPRODUCER (offscreen) Thank you. \nDIRECTOR (offscreen) Thank you. \nPRODUCER (offscreen) It was very nice. \nASSISTANT #1 (offscreen, overlapping) Terrific. \nThe camera has reached the executives in the audience.  They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. \nSTAGE MANAGER (offscreen, overlapping the executives' chatter) April Knox? \nThe film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" The stage is very black, stark, except for April and the pianist. \nAPRIL (singing) \"Someday When I'm awfully low When the world is cold I will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look Tonight...\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A STREET OUTSIDE THE THEATER - DAY \nA theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk.  Workmen and various street noises can be heard indistinctly in the background. \nHOLLY I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised. \nAPRIL (sighing) Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money. \nHOLLY Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health. \nAPRIL Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. \nHOLLY (reacting) What? \nAPRIL (gesturing) Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. (chuckling) I didn't know what to say. \nMICKEY Well, it certainly doesn't look promising. \nMickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway.  He starts to pound it. \nFATHER (offscreen) Who knows what'll be? \nMickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door. \nFATHER (gesturing with his hands full) I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious. \nMICKEY (pounding on the door) Mom, come out! \nMOTHER (offscreen in the bathroom) Of course there's a God, you idiot! You don't believe in God? \nMICKEY (sighing) But if there's a God, then wh-why is there so much evil in the world? (shrugging) What-- Just on a simplistic level. Why-why were there Nazis? \nMOTHER (offscreen in the bathroom) Tell him, Max. \nMickey, reacting, hits his forehead. \nFATHER (offscreen) How the hell do I know why there were Nazis?  I don't know how the can opener works. \nMickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: \nA beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene. \nThe music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. \nThe choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. \nHe picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. \nNext is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. \nMickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. \nWith the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on top of the saint. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY \nLee is walking down the street, looking around her.  The sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of traffic are heard.  She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco fa\u00e7ade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction.  Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. \nLEE (overlapping Hannah's gasp) Hi. \nThe sisters laugh and embrace each other. \nHANNAH Hi.  Where's Holly? \nLEE (overlapping) Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late. \nHANNAH (sighing) Oh, yeah?  How's she doing? \nShe turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance. \nLEE (following Hannah through the restaurant's doors) Oh, God, you know Holly.  When she's depressed, she's manic.  I think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch. \nThey disappear inside.  The camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk in.  It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and high ceilings.  A waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground.  The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. \nHANNAH (pulling off her scarf, still on the subject of Holly) I hope you tell her it was your idea... \nLEE Why? \nHANNAH (overlapping) ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive. \nLEE (unbuttoning her coat) Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all. \nHannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room. She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well.  In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. \nHANNAH (offscreen) So how are you? \nLEE Oh, me, I'm okay. \nHANNAH (offscreen) Do you miss Frederick? \nLEE No. \nHANNAH (offscreen) I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- \nLEE (interrupting, her voice slightly higher-pitched as she takes off her coat) How are you? \nHANNAH (offscreen) I'm okay. \nLEE (overlapping) You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick? (laughing) I mean, Elliot. \nHANNAH (offscreen, overlapping) Y-yeah. \nHannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat; it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things.  Now only Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk.  In the background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar. \nHANNAH (continuing) Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know. (shaking her head, her arms crossed) He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months. \nLEE (offscreen, overlapping) Really? \nHANNAH Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult. \nLEE (offscreen) Oh... \nHANNAH (overlapping, gesturing) I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions. \nLEE (offscreen) Like what? \nAs Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes. \nHANNAH (gesturing) I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... \nLEE (walking back onscreen without her coat, reacting) Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that. \nMICKEY (continuing) ...in a really horrible way. \nHOLLY (smiling, glancing away for a moment) Oh, well, that was a long time ago. \nMICKEY (overlapping) You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you? \nHOLLY (shrugging) People change...you know. \nMICKEY (touching Holly's shoulder) Well, I hope you've changed. \nHOLLY Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY (overlapping) I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired... \nHOLLY (overlapping, shaking her head) Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed. \nMICKEY (continuing) ...namely a personality. \nHolly chuckles and turns to look at more records.  She walks down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records. Mickey walks beside her. \nMICKEY So how are you? \nHOLLY (smiling) I'm okay. \nMICKEY You didn't answer my question. What are you doing? \nHOLLY Oh, nothing much.  You know... \nMICKEY (interrupting) Well... \nHOLLY (overlapping) ...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it? \nHOLLY (laughing) Probably not. \nMICKEY Are you, are you out of work or something? \nHOLLY No, well...I've been trying to write. \nMICKEY Have you? \nHOLLY (picking up a record and looking at it) Yeah. \nMICKEY Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff? \nHOLLY (touching her chin for a moment) Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this. \nMICKEY (overlapping) No, you can tell me. \nHOLLY Come on. \nMICKEY No, I am.  I am. \nHOLLY (overlapping) Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, \"Hey, I have something I just wrote,\" right? \nMICKEY Nobody ever said it. \nHOLLY Really? \nMICKEY (overlapping) This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY (interrupting, turning from the record bins to look at Mickey) Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote? \nMICKEY (nodding his head) Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would. \nHOLLY (laughing, touching her face) No, the reason I ask is-- \nMICKEY (overlapping) You've always hated my taste in the past. \nHOLLY (pulling her jacket off her shoulders) No, I haven't. \nMICKEY You have. \nHOLLY (gesturing, looking at Mickey) I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so-- \nMICKEY (chuckling, gesturing) I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year. \nHOLLY You're kidding me. \nMICKEY (overlapping) I've done no television whatsoever. No. \nAs Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of records, reacting to his words.  She looks offscreen at him, then down at some records.  The camera follows her. \nMICKEY (offscreen, continuing) I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year... \nHOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Oh.  Oh. \nMICKEY (offscreen, overlapping) ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But-- \nMickey walks back onscreen to Holly.  The two of them are partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation. \nHOLLY (interrupting) You're okay, though, huh? \nMICKEY I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you? \nHOLLY (face offscreen, obscured by the sign) Oh, I'm fine. \nMICKEY What...what about your script? (face offscreen obscured by the sign) So what's it about? \nHOLLY (face offscreen) Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion. \nMICKEY (face offscreen) You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing. \nThey emerge from behind the Jazz sign, still walking, still talking. \nHOLLY (smiling, gesturing) But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script. \nMICKEY Hmm. \nHOLLY (touching her face) Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh... \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...I really hit bottom.  You know, I just felt that in a Godless universe, I didn't want to go on living.  Now I happen to own this rifle... (coughing) \nMickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead.  He shuts his eyes tightly. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...which I loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead. And I remember thinking, at the time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then I thought...what if I'm wrong? What if there is a God?  I mean, after all, nobody really knows that. \nThe camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him.  Its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps.  A clock faintly ticks. \nMICKEY (V.O.) But then I thought, no.  You know, maybe is not good enough.  I want certainty or nothing.  And I remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and I was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot. \nThe gun goes off with a loud bang.  The mirror shatters. \nMICKEY (V.O.) All of a sudden, the gun went off. \nMickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror.  The sounds of his excited neighbors, their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his tale. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently... \nNEIGHBOR #1 (offscreen, overlapping) What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's going on? \nMICKEY (V.O.) (continuing) ...but I was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me. \nNEIGHBOR #2 (offscreen, overlapping) I don't know.  I heard a gun.  Is everything all right? \nMickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit living room.  He looks around frantically, his shirt loose. \nFinally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table.  The gun goes off a second time.  Mickey, standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head.  The doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door. \nMICKEY (V.O.) And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and-and I don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium.  And, uh, you know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door. \nMickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I-I-I-I didn't know what to say. You know, I was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute... \nHe returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...and I-I jus knew one thing. \nThe film cuts to a West Side street.  It's an overcast day. Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including Klein's Pharmacy and a \"Bar-B-Q\" take out.  Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that house.  I had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head. And I remember very clearly.  I walked the streets.  I walked and I walked.  I-I didn't know what was going through my mind.  It all seemed so violent and un-unreal to me.  And I wandered... \nThe movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside.  Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by.  His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...for a long time on the Upper West Side, you know, an-and it must have been hours!  You know, my, my feet hurt.  My head was, was pounding, and, and I had to sit down.  I went into a movie house. I-I didn't know what was playing or anything. \nMickey walks into the movie house.  He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside.  He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. \nMICKEY (V.O.) I just, I just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective. \nThe film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone.  The sounds of the \"xylophone\" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat.  The \"xylophone\" music stops and changes to \"Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho\" as sung by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie.  The singing continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his tale: \nMICKEY (V.O.) And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I sat down (sighing) and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I'd seen many times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it.  And, you know, I'm, I'm watching these people up on the screen, and I started getting hooked o-on the film, you know? \nThe film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk.  The Marx Brothers, as well as the hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing \"Hidee-hidee-ho.\" They kick their heels up in the air.  They sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing \"Oh-h-h-h-h-h...\" \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...And I started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? I mean, isn't it so stupid?  I mean, l-look at all the people up there on the screen.  You know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true? \nThe movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater.  The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak. \nMICKEY (V.O.) What if there's no God, and you only go around once and that's it? Well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience?  You know, what the hell, it-i-it's not all a drag.  And I'm thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life... \nAs Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen.  The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...searching for answers I'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts.  And...you know... \nThe film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. \nMICKEY (V.O.) ...after, who knows?  I mean, you know, maybe there is something. Nobody really knows.  I know, I know \"maybe\" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have.  And...then, I started to sit back, and I actually began to enjoy myself. \nAs Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen.  The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members.  They jump down from the bench, still singing. Their voices swell. \nMARX BROTHERS & COMPANY \"Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming around the mountain...\" \nThe Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park.  The flashback is over. Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as \"You Made Me Love You\" begins to play in the background.  They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. \nHOLLY (gesturing) Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and (chuckling) that's this. \nMICKEY (mumbling) Oh, yeah?  What? \nHOLLY (overlapping) That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself. \nMICKEY Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous. \nHOLLY (overlapping) It's all right. \nMICKEY I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- (inhaling) \nHolly laughs. \nMICKEY So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or... \nHOLLY Sure.  Sure, uh, yes. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening? \nHOLLY Yeah. \nThey stroll offscreen. \"You Made Me Love You\" grows louder and the film cuts to: \nOne year later. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT \nA large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking through the doorway. \n", "test1_input": "<b><!-- </b> <b>/* </b>Break-out-of-frames script By Website Abstraction (http://wsabstract.com) Over 400+ free scripts here!

HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning against the dining room doorway.  She gazes into the camera with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the screen. \nELLIOT (V.O.) God, she's beautiful. \nLee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away.  The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation. \nELLIOT (V.O.) She's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater. \nLee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings. \nLEE Hi, how are you? \nTwo more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now.  Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room.  Elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her... \nLee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged. \nELLIOT (V.O.) ...and tell her how much I love her and take care of her.  Stop it, you idiot.  She's your wife's sister. But I can't help it. \nThe camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother.  Elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I'm consumed by her.  It's been months now.  I dream about her.  I- I, I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee. (sighing) What am I gonna do? \nLee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother.  She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting.  Before, when she... \nElliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man.  Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them.  The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her. \nELLIOT (V.O.) ...squeezed past me in the doorway, and I smelled that perfume on the back of her neck... \nElliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk.  Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on. \nELLIOT (V.O.) ...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna swoon!  Easy... \nThe camera resumes following a smiling Lee.  She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced. \nELLIOT (V.O.) You're a dignified financial advisor.  It doesn't look good for you to swoon. \nThe camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the offscreen Lee.  In the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other. \nHannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted Elliot. \nHANNAH (nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre) Elliot?  Elliot? (rubbing his shoulder) Sweetheart? \nElliot returns from his reveries with a start. \nELLIOT (turning to Hannah) Mm-hm? \nHANNAH (pointing to the tray) Have you tried these?  These are wonderful. (nibbling, swallowing) Holly and her friend made them. \nElliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room. \nELLIOT (swallowing) They're fantastic. \nHANNAH (overlapping, still eating) Aren't they great? \nELLIOT Your sister is an unbelievable cook. \nHANNAH (swallowing) I know!  I know! \nElliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway. She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests. \nHANNAH (walking offscreen) She has all the cooking talent. \nELLIOT (walking offscreen swallowing) No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well. \nHANNAH (offscreen) Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these. \nHolly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly. \nELLIOT (offscreen, overlapping Holly) Holly, why don't you open your own restaurant? \nHOLLY (turning to the offscreen Elliot and Hannah, trying to swallow) Mmm, we practically are.  Well... (holding her hand to her mouth) not a restaurant, but... (swallowing) April and I are going to do some catering! \nHANNAH (offscreen) What?  You're kidding! \nHOLLY (nodding) No, no, we decided! \nHolly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk over to her. \nHANNAH Perfect! \nHOLLY (nodding and swallowing) Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so (gesturing) we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties. \nELLIOT (nodding) Great idea. \nHANNAH (agreeing) I know. \n", "test1_true": "HOLLY (swallowing and nodding) I know. \nHolly and Hannah begin to laugh. \nHOLLY (gesturing to Elliot, still laughing) Get outta here. (to Hannah) Could I speak to you privately? \nHANNAH Oh, sure. \nHolly and Hannah walk off; Elliot watches them leave. \nELLIOT (calling after them as he nibbles on an hors d'oeuvre) I'm her husband!  She tells me anything! \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to speak.  The faint sounds of music are still heard. \nHOLLY Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. (sipping her drink) Don't get upset. \nHANNAH (stirring some food in a saucepan on the stove) Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm? \nHOLLY This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts. \nAs Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter.  She walks on-and-offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister. \nHANNAH Holly, please.  Don't insult me. \nHOLLY (putting her empty glass and plate down on the table) Someday, I'll pay it all back. \nHANNAH I know.  H-how much do you need? \nHOLLY Two thousand dollars. \nHannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily.  She turns to Holly. \nHANNAH (trying to nod her head casually) Uh-huh. \nHOLLY (gesturing, her back to the camera) Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great. \nHannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly. \nHOLLY (turning to face Hannah) You admit that we're great cooks, right? \nHANNAH (nodding, back at the stove now, stirring in a pot) Yeah. \nHOLLY (putting her hands in her pockets) Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... (gesturing) and some old debts I have outstanding. \nHANNAH (looking at her sister) Will you just tell me one thing? \nHOLLY (nodding) Okay. \nHANNAH Are we talking about cocaine again? \nHOLLY (shaking her head no) I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties. \nA timer goes off.  Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove.  Holly turns to face her.  Only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face.  As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre.  In the background, her parents can be heard singing in the living room. \nHOLLY I mean, obviously, I'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know.  We both still go to auditions. Something could turn up at any moment.  But the parties are at night, days are free, I can still take my acting class.  I haven't done drugs on a year. \nHolly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to: \nINT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe living room is crowded with family and guests sitting comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's father, plays \"Bewitched\" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits nearby, accompanying him in their duet.  A child is sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly; others drink and eat, listening. \nEVAN & NORMA (singing) \"A whimpering, simpering Child again Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered Am I...\" \nAs they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway. \nLEE Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane again! \nLee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter.  Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe. Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink.  The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other. \nHANNAH (smiling and turning to Lee) Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs? \nLEE (nodding to Holly, touching her arm) I think they're fantastic. \nHANNAH (to Holly) You've outdone yourself. \nHOLLY (overlapping her sisters, shrugging and smiling) Oh, my God.  Thank you. \nLEE (interrupting, to Hannah) I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so... \nHANNAH (overlapping) Ohh? \nHOLLY (overlapping, lighting a cigarette) Uh-oh. \nLEE (continuing) ...before she starts turning into Camille... (laughing) \nHOLLY (overlapping) Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning. \nLEE (turning to Holly) At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice? \nHOLLY (nodding) Mm-hm. \nHANNAH (turning to look at her sisters, laughing) Doesn't she look great in that new dress? \nHOLLY (nodding) Yeah. \nLEE (nodding) Yeah. \nThe sisters all talk at once; Hannah is still working at the sink. \nHANNAH Don't you think she does? \nHOLLY She really does, though. \n", "test2_input": "HANNAH (overlapping) I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would-- \nHOLLY (offscreen, interrupting) Uh, losers!  All losers! \nHANNAH You're too demanding. \nHOLLY (offscreen) You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with! \nThe camera, slowly circling the table, is back on Lee's face. While her sisters argue emotionally on her right and left, she is looking down, biting her lip.  She is outwardly still, but her face is registering her seething emotions. \nHANNAH (offscreen) You're crazy!  That's not true. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre. \nLEE (interrupting angrily, looking as if she's about to cry) Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?! \nHANNAH (offscreen, overlapping) Oh, now-- (stuttering) \nLEE (interrupting, shaking her head) She's going through a really rough time right now. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Why are you so upset? \nLEE (sobbing and gesturing) You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. (sniffing back her tears) \nHOLLY (leaning over to Lee, puzzled, reacting to her sister's tears) What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden? \nHANNAH (offscreen) Look. (onscreen, as the camera circles around the table) Listen.  Listen. (tapping Holly on her shoulder and gesturing) You want to write?  Write. \nHOLLY (offscreen, overlapping to Lee) What's the matter? \nHANNAH (flinging her hands) Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore. \nHOLLY (offscreen) Good. \nHANNAH (shaking her head) Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play. \nShe opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset. \nHANNAH (to Lee) What's the matter?  What's the matter with you? (offscreen again as the camera circles back to Lee) You look pale.  You okay? \nLEE (overlapping, nodding and stuttering) I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache. \nHANNAH (offscreen, overlapping) Yeah? \nLEE (still rubbing her forehead, looking down at the menu) I think we need to eat. \nCUT TO: \nSummer in New York. \nA piano plays \"Bewitched\" in the background as the film cuts to a large tree, covered with bright white blossoms.  The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street.  A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building, to Elliot's analyst's office.  The psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts and a large lamp.  The analyst's fingers are touching, his arms resting on the chair, as he listens to the offscreen Elliot. \nELLIOT (offscreen) I-I can't seem to take action. I'm-I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to kill his uncle. \nThe music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair.  He holds a long, thin cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch.  He face is not yet seen. \nELLIOT (face offscreen) I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah. And in no other area am I a procrastinator. \nElliot raises his cigarette to take a drag.  The camera follows the cigarette up to his face.  Elliot looks thoughtful as the movie cuts to: \nEXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY \nLee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, is running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes.  Elliot continues to talk over the scene... \nELLIOT (V.O.) Meanwhile...Lee has no direction. She's taking courses at Columbia...but just randomly. \n...as Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name. They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together. \nELLIOT (V.O.) I try not to call her, but then she calls me and then...I call and...we try to resist meeting, but...once in a while we meet.  Sometimes we argue because I can't break up my marriage.  Sometimes we wind up making love and...we both feel terrible. \nThe film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office. \nELLIOT But it's my fault. \nElliot takes a last drag on his cigarette.  The camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray. \nELLIOT (face offscreen) For all my education, accomplishments, and so-called wisdom...I can't fathom my own heart. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nHare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park.  The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day.  The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side.  It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm. \nKRISHNA LEADER What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna? \nMICKEY (gesturing, walking onscreen) Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me. \nKRISHNA LEADER Yeah, well, what's your religion? \nMICKEY (gesturing) Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I-- \nKRISHNA LEADER (interrupting) You're afraid of dying? MICKEY (gesturing) Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something? \nKRISHNA LEADER (handing some Krishna literature over the fence to Mickey) Take our literature... \nMICKEY (nodding, taking the material) Uh-huh. \nKRISHNA LEADER ...read it over, and think about it. \nMICKEY (looking down at the material he's just received) Well, okay.  Thank you very much. \nKRISHNA LEADER You're welcome.  Hare Krishna. \nMickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence.  He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering.  His voice is heard over the screen. \nMICKEY (V.O.) Who are you kidding?  You're gonna be a Krishna?  You're gonna shave your head and put on robes and dance around at airports?  You'll look like Jerry Lewis.  Oh, God, I'm so depressed. \n", "test2_true": "Autumn chill. \nBach's Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to the waterfront at dusk.  A bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair.  She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay.  The view is contemplative, beautiful in the dim light. \nLee is alone; her hands are in her pockets.  Lee, thinking, is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the background. \nLEE (V.O.) The nights are really getting cooler.  Summer went so quickly. Soon it'll be fall. (walking to the beach and sitting down) My literature professor really likes me.  It was fun being out with him last night. (staring pensively at the water) Funny.  I feel like I'm betraying Elliot...but that's ridiculous. Why shouldn't I see Doug?  Elliot's not free. (pausing) Just go one step at a time.  Let's see what the next few months bring. \nThe concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance.  She wears a football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript in her arms.  It's a busy corner.  People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah. \nHOLLY (into the telephone) Hannah?  Hi.  Listen, um, you'll be happy to know that your money has not gone completely to waste... No, I have an actual first rough draft of something I wrote... Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, well, I showed it to Lee, and she gave me some good pointers. And, um, listen, I'm pretty near where you live.  I wonder if I could just drop it off...and, you know, when you have time, some time, read it, an-and we'll talk when I come over at Thanksgiving. Okay?  All right.  Okay.  Oh, wait, wait. (turning her body, still on the phone) Listen.  Listen.  I think Lee met an interesting guy at Columbia... Yeah.  Yeah, well, he sounds really nice... (puffing on her cigarette) Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we'll talk at Thanksgiving.  Bye-bye. \nHolly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to: \nINT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT \nIt's Thanksgiving at Hannah's once again.  Guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano.  A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa.  An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group. \nEVAN (gesturing) Now, here...here's a song that Norma sang on that trip we made up to the show in Buffalo.  And, oh, was she beautiful that night! \nThe guests laugh appreciatively.  A woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine. \nNORMA Come on. (laughing and touching Evan's shoulder) \nEVAN (overlapping, to the woman) Thank you, honey. (putting his drink down on the piano) Oh, yes, you were, dear.  Don't you remember that night? (gesturing and pushing back some sheet music that was starting to fall) She was so beautiful...she was so beautiful that when men saw her walking along the streets, they'd drive their cars right up on the sidewalk. \nHe laughs; the guests laugh with him. \nEVAN (looking back at Norma) Isn't that right, honey, eh? \nNORMA (tapping his shoulder) A slight exaggeration. \nThe guest continue to laugh; they are charmed. \nEVAN (overlapping Norma, laughing) I know. \nNORMA (gesturing) But only slight. \nEvan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano.  A nearby woman toasts him with her drink.  The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music.  Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan.  A couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away.  Some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-laden wall.  Evan is playing the piano with exuberance.  Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face.  She mouths the words to the song Evan is playing, \"It Could Happen to You.\" The woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing in the doorway with a group of children.  Mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres.  The man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal Lee.  She is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music.  Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway.  Several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her. \nELLIOT (sipping his drink) You've been very cold to me tonight. \nLEE (glancing back at Elliot, then turning away) No. \nELLIOT Is something wrong? \nLEE (turning) Oh, not here. (touching Elliot's arm) There are too many people around. \nLee slips past Elliot and walks away.  Elliot looks back at her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHolly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen food.  Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a glass porthole.  In the foreground, the kitchen table is crowded with bowls and plates of food.  An open cupboard separates Holly from the rest of the room. \nHOLLY (looking offscreen) Hey, Hannah?  You know, I think Lee is really serious about her new boyfriend.  Yeah, eh, from what I understand he sounds really nice. \nHannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator.  She carries two tomatoes. \nHOLLY I'm so happy for her.  I think she's in love. \nHannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly. \nHOLLY (reacting) Hey, what's the matter? \nHANNAH (taking a bunch of celery out and slamming the refrigerator door) I'm real upset about what you wrote. \nHannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food. \nHOLLY My script? \nHANNAH It's obviously based on Elliot and me. \nHOLLY Oh, so loosely. \nHANNAH (angrily) No, not \"Oh, so loosely\"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us? \nHOLLY (shrugging, walking out of the pantry area) Well-- \nHANNAH (interrupting) Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off? \nHolly walks over to the sink and washes her hands. \nHOLLY (reacting) Well, it's a made-up story. \nShe dries her hands as Hannah, her arms laden with vegetables, strides over to her sister. \nHANNAH (yelling) No, it's real exact!  The-the situations, the dialogue, everything. It's-it's full of intimate details between Elliot and me! Which I don't, I don't see how you could even possibly know about.  A conversation we once had about adoption? \nHannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the sink. \nHOLLY (gesturing, the towel still in her hand, as she speaks to her offscreen sister) Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so obviously you discussed it with her. You... (pacing around the table) I just took the essence and I blew it up into drama. \nHolly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the kitchen, carrying even more vegetables. \nHANNAH I don't see how Lee could know about these things.  I don't!  I don't tell her everything. \nHannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables down on the counter.  Holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food-laden table. \nHOLLY (reacting) Wow, I guess I hit a nerve. \nHANNAH (turning to look at Holly) You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient? \nHOLLY (stopping her mindless straightening at the table, reacting) Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. (walking offscreen to the sink area) Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. \"You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful.\" \nHANNAH (walking out of the pantry to the food- laden table) You're grateful, but you resent me. \n", "test3_input": "HOLLY (offscreen) Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong. \nHannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket.  She stops at the corner of the table and faces Hannah. \nHOLLY (onscreen) Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems. \nHANNAH (gesturing) Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private! \nHannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her armload of spices, into the pantry area. \nHOLLY (turning to look at her sister as she walks past) Well, why don't you share them with us? \nHANNAH (with her back to the camera) I don't...I don't want to bother everyone. \nHOLLY (facing her sister's back) That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered. \nHANNAH (turning to look at Holly) I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you. \nHOLLY (shaking her head) No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry. \nHannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter. Holly turns away. \nThe film cuts to the dining room doorway.  Guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room.  Lee and Elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation.  The piano, as well as soft chatter, is heard in the background. \nLEE (offscreen) It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore. \nELLIOT (offscreen, overlapping) Uh... (onscreen, gesturing) I-I-I know.  I deserve this. \nLEE (touching her chest) Look, I'm just as much at fault. \nELLIOT (overlapping, gesturing) If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you! \nLEE I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else. (turning and walking away from Elliot) I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever. \nLee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly. \nELLIOT (offscreen) But it hasn't been forever. (walking over to Lee at the just-closed door) \nLEE (gesturing) It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know. \nELLIOT (shaking his head) Yeah, but we-we made so many plans. \nLEE (overlapping, gesturing) Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else. \nThe door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks.  She walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china.  She puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave. \nLEE (to Mavis) Dinner soon? \nMAVIS About fifteen minutes. \nLEE (nodding) Uh-huh.  Good. \nMavis leaves.  Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off. \nELLIOT And you're in love overnight? \nLEE I care a great deal about him, yes. \nELLIOT (trying to put his arm around Lee) Lee... \nLEE (pulling back, flinging her hands) Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over! \nThey look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to Hannah's kitchen.  Norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door.  She looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside.  Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area. \nNORMA (holding the door, half in and half out of the kitchen) Sweetheart, I loved your script.  I thought it was so clever. \nHOLLY (turning to Norma, smiling, and holding a glass of wine) Well, you're my mother.  Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker. \nNORMA (gesturing) I particularly liked the character of the mother.  Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth. \nHolly chuckles. \nNORMA I'm so proud! \nHOLLY Oh, Mom, thanks. \nNorma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her.  Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room.  A chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor. \nThey lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips.  Other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa.  Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests.  The piano plays on. \nUNCLE (raising his bottle of beer to the children) Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right? \nThe children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up their \"illicit\" glasses of beer. \nUNCLE Are we supposed to have beer? Yeeeah! \nThe uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses.  They cry indistinctly with excitement. \nUNCLE (overlapping the children's squeals of delight) Let me at it! (to one of the little boys) How's that, Fletcher? \nLaughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is. \nUNCLE (to the little girl) Doll?  To Thanksgiving.  Here's a little toast, doll. (clinking glasses) Come on.  Bottoms up. \nThe uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in Hannah's bedroom.  Her face moves on to the screen. \nHANNAH (to the offscreen Elliot) Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life? \nELLIOT (offscreen) Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you. \nELLIOT (offscreen) Look, I've got a splitting headache and I don't like being accused. \nHannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink. \nHANNAH (gesturing) I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving? (closing the door of the bathroom slightly so only she is seen on the screen) Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something? \nELLIOT No. \n", "test3_true": "HANNAH (following Elliot and gesturing, talking to his back) Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you? \nELLIOT (taking a bottle of aspirin from the cabinet and walking back to the sink, gesturing) Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH (gesturing) You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less. \nELLIOT (angrily turning to Hannah and pointing as she shouts) Hannah, I am very mixed up!  Now please! \nElliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door. \nHANNAH (reacting, her voice trembling slightly, and gesturing) Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us. \nELLIOT (walking towards a towel rack and gesturing) Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke. \nHe dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk. \nHANNAH (gesturing) Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them? \nELLIOT (whirling around to face Hannah, snapping) Leave me alone, can you?! \nHe closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself from view. \nELLIOT (continuing in a lower tone) Jesus, I've told you.  I need someone I can matter to. \nThe camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom. \nHANNAH (reacting, near tears) You matter to me.  Completely. \nELLIOT (pausing, his voice rising again) It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return! \nHe opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back. \nHANNAH (gesturing, pleading) But, look...I-I have enormous needs. \nElliot slams the medicine cabinet shut. \nELLIOT (shouting) Well, I can't see them, and neither can Lee or Holly! \nHe leaves.  Hannah watches him go, reacting.  She is stunned. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT \nThe dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall.  Piano music is still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room. She briefly looks around, lost in thought.  She sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel.  One shows Hannah and Elliot on their wedding day.  Another shows Elliot, obscured in the shadows.  Yet another has captured Norma as a young girl.  The camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera.  There is no sound. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses.  Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view.  He turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black. \nHANNAH (offscreen) It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost. \nELLIOT (offscreen) You're not lost. \nElliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow.  He leans over and kisses her. \nELLIOT I love you so much. \nThey begin to kiss passionately as \"Bewitched\" starts to play in the background. \nCUT TO: \nLucky I ran into you. \n\"Bewitched\" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime New York City street.  Mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians.  He pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks. \"Bewitched\" continues to play as he passes Tower Records' neon-lit window.  He glances inside...and sees Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records. \nMickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of Holly. \nMICKEY (gesturing) Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together. \nHOLLY (laughing, holding some records) I remember you. \nMICKEY (overlapping) Yes, you do recall, right? \nHOLLY (overlapping, smiling and nodding) I recall you. \nMICKEY (gesturing) I was walking past and I saw you in here... \nHOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Yeah. \nMICKEY ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh... \nHOLLY (interrupting, laughing and shaking her head) We didn't hit it off. \nMICKEY (overlapping, smiling) Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots. \nHOLLY How are you? \nMICKEY Good.  How are you? \nHOLLY I'm fine. \nMICKEY (overlapping) You look wonderful. \nHOLLY (chuckling, shaking her head) Oh, no. \nMICKEY (overlapping, scratching his head) Yeah, really.  You do.  You do. \nHOLLY Yeah? \nMICKEY It was a terrible evening. \nHOLLY Yeah, it was. \nMICKEY (overlapping, gesturing) Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. (touching his nose as Holly laughs) you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... (touching his nose again) \nHOLLY (overlapping, laughing) I'd never do that. \n"}

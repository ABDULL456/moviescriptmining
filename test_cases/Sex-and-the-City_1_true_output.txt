Carrie and Charlotte look up from their magazines. 
CHARLOTTE What are you talking about? 
MIRANDA I forgot to get a wax. 
SAMANTHA Since when -- 1998? 
Carrie looks away, resumes reading. 
MIRANDA I've had other things on my mind. 
SAMANTHA I could be on death row and not have that situation. 
MIRANDA Well, when you're married, Samantha -- you have a different set of priorities. 
SAMANTHA Honey don't blame marriage -- (re: Charlotte) This one's married -- and she's not growing a national forest. How do you even cross your legs? (beat) Let me make you a spa appointment -- Any thicker and you won't be able to find it. 
Miranda gets up from the chair and looks at her, mad. 
MIRANDA So what -- It's my fault?! I let the sex go out of our marriage! I deserve what I got. Thanks for understanding. 
She walks away. Samantha calls after her. 
SAMANTHA Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what -- 
MIRANDA I'm fine! 
Miranda goes inside. Carries throws her magazine down. 
CARRIE Let's go down to the hotel for dinner on the beach tonight. 
CHARLOTTE Really? 
CARRIE Yeah. I've got to do something to pull me out of my Mexicoma. 
SAMANTHA Oh, honey... you made a little joke. Good for you. 
Samantha nods. Charlotte smiles; encouraged. 
104   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER             104 
A romantic open-air restaurant on the beach. A MARIACHI BAND is serenading HONEYMOON COUPLES. A MALE HOST leads the girls across the small dance floor to their table. As they walk Miranda notices a slow dancing TWENTY-SOMETHING HONEYMOON COUPLE kissing -- very much in love. 
MIRANDA (to Carrie) Don't look to your -- 
CARRIE Too late. 
They arrive at their table and the host places down MENUS. FELIX, (40) the waiter comes up to them. 
MAITRE' D Buenos notches. My name is Felix, I`ll be your server. 
SAMANTHA (to Felix) Felix -- We'll start with quatro margaritas. 
CHARLOTTE No, I'm not drinking. Just bottled water. 
CARRIE (to waiter) I'll drink hers. 
FELIX May I have your room numbers? 
CARRIE We're staying in one of the private houses. Number three. 
He looks down onto a list he is holding, then up to Carrie. 
MAITRE' D Very good, Mrs. Preston. 
The waiter smiles and walks away. 
CARRIE That was like taking a bullet. 
74A. 
Miranda, Samantha, and Carrie look at the menu. Charlotte reaches into her purse and pulls out a little pudding and places it on the table. They all look at her. 
MIRANDA Charlotte had pudding in her Prada. 
Samantha laughs. Miranda smiles. Carrie looks. 
CARRIE Will I ever laugh again? (beat; then) I'm serious. 
MIRANDA Yes. 
CARRIE When? 
MIRANDA When something is really, really funny. 
The Mariachi band strolls by playing. 
CARRIE Thank god for that Mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts. 
Felix re-enters with the drinks. 
SAMANTHA Fabulous -- and keep them coming. 
104A   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104A 
Food is on the table -- but Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are mostly drinking. Charlotte is eating her pudding. 
CARRIE After everything I know... After twenty years of everything we've learned -- I threw it all away for the thrill of putting his name on the honeymoon suite. (beat) If I met me now -- I wouldn't know me. 
74B. 
SAMANTHA Well, as long as we're going down this road. 
They look at her -- she sips her cocktail. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I can't believe my life revolves around a man. On what planet did I allow that to happen? 
CHARLOTTE You love him. 
SAMANTHA Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own? Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? Is it all about the other person? Is that love? 
MIRANDA No, that's marriage. 
CARRIE So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing? Good to know right about now. 
Samantha looks down at her gardenia ring. 
SAMANTHA Even this ring. I wanted to buy this for myself. That meant something to me. To be able to do that. Then, he buys it for me. 
CHARLOTTE Because he knew how much you loved it. 
SAMANTHA Yes. But now, every time I look down at it... I see him. Not me. 
CHARLOTTE You could look at it and see a man who loves you and wants you to be happy. 
SAMANTHA No, you could look at it and see that. I'm Samantha.

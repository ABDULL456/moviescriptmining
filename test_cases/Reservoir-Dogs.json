{"train": "Quentin Tarantino's \nR E S E R V O I R   D O G S \nOctober 22, 1990 \nThis movie is dedicated to these following sources of \ninspiration: \nTIMOTHY CAREY \nROGER CORMAN \nANDRE DeTOTH \nCHOW YUEN FAT \nJEAN LUC GODDARD \nJEAN PIERRE MELVILLE \nLAWRENCE TIERNEY \nLIONEL WHITE \nRESERVOIR DOGS \n1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING \nEight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE, MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT, and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna. \nMR. PINK \"Like a Virgin\" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.  The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks. \nMR. BLUE No it's not.  It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive-- \nMR. PINK --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay. Tell that bullshit to the tourists. \nJOE (looking through his address book) Toby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think... think... \nMR. PINK It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy.  Now granted that's what \"True Blue\" is about, no argument about that. \nMR. ORANGE Which one is \"True Blue?\" \nNICE GUY EDDIE You don't remember \"True Blue?\" That was a big ass hit for Madonna.  Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of \"True Blue.\" \nMR. ORANGE Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it.  All I asked was how does it go?  Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan. \nMR. BROWN I hate Madonna. \nMR. BLUE I like her early stuff.  You know, \"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but once she got into her \"Papa Don't Preach\" phase, I don't know, I tuned out. \nMR. PINK Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here.  You're gonna make me lose my train of thought. \nJOE Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl. \nMR. PINK Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it? \nNICE GUY EDDIE Can you believe the songs they been playin? \nMR. PINK No, I can't.  You know what I heard the other day?  \"Heartbeat - It's Lovebeat,\" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin grade. \nNICE GUY EDDIE When I was coming down here, I was playin it.  And \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" came on.  Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times.  I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy. \nMR. BLUE You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy? \nNICE GUY EDDIE I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy. \nMR. BLONDE They say it in the song. \nNICE GUY EDDIE I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.  I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife. \nJOE No, she did it.  She killed the cheatin wife, too. \nMR. PINK You know the part in \"Gypsies, Tramps and Theives,\" when she says \"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?\"  I could never figure out what he did. \nThe table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She has the check, and a pot of coffee. \nWAITRESS Can I get anybody more coffee. \nJOE No, we're gonna be hittin it. I'll take care of the check. \nShe hands the bill to him. \nWAITRESS Here ya go.  Please pay at the register, if you wouldn't mind. \nJOE Sure thing. \nWAITRESS You guys have a wonderful day. \nThey all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up. \nJOE I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip. (to Mr. White) And when I come back, I want my book back. \nMR. WHITE Sorry, it's my book now. \nJOE Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya? \nMr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White acts shot.  Joe exits. \nNICE GUY EDDIE Okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady. \nEverybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. Everybody, that is, except Mr. White. \nNICE GUY EDDIE C'mon, throw in a buck. \nMR. WHITE Uh-uh.  I don't tip. \nNICE GUY EDDIE Whaddaya mean you don't tip? \nMR. WHITE I don't believe in it. \nMR. BLONDE Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips. \nMR. WHITE Fuck all that. \nThey all laugh. \nMR. WHITE Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up.  But that ain't my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.  But what I won't do is play ball.  And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: \"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise. \nMR. ORANGE He's convinced me.  Give me my dollar back. \nEverybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table. \nJOE Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling.  Wait a minute, who didn't throw in? \nMR. ORANGE Mr. White. \nJOE (to Mr. Orange) Mr. White? (to Mr. White) Why? \nMR. ORANGE He don't tip. \nJOE (to Mr. Orange) He don't tip? (to Mr. White) You don't tip?  Why? \nMR. ORANGE He don't believe in it. \nJOE (to Mr. Orange) He don't believe in it? (to Mr. White) You don't believe in it? \nMR. ORANGE Nope. \nJOE (to Mr. Orange) Shut up! (to Mr. White) Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast. \nMR. WHITE Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't. \nJOE Whatever.  Just throw in your dollar, and let's move. (to Mr. Blonde) See what I'm dealing with here. Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with infants. \nThe eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst themselves. \n2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY \nCREDIT SEQUENCE: \nWhen the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK: \nOver the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in agony. \nUnder the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS, through traffic. \nOver the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY ELSE SAY: \nSOMEBODY ELSE (OS) Just hold on buddy boy. \nSomebody stops screaming long enough to say: \nSOMEBODY (OS) I'm sorry.  I can't believe she killed me.  Who would've fuckin thought that? \nCUT TO: \nMr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over him. \n7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY \nThe CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver. \nMR. PINK Get outta the car!  Get the fuck outta the car! \nThe Shocked Woman starts screaming. \nMr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked. \nMR. PINK Open the fucking door! \nEXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW \nMr. Pink SMASHES it in our face. \n8      EXT. STREET - DAY \nDOLLY with Cops coming up fast. \nMr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car. \nThe Cops reach the corner, guns aimed. \nUsing the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at the Cops. \nEverybody HITS the ground, or scatters. \nMr. Pink HOPS in the car. \nCops FIRE. \n9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nCAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down the street, with the Cops FIRING after him. \nBACK TO: \n10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY \nMr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom. \nMR. PINK Tagged a couple of cops.  Did you kill anybody? \nMR. WHITE A few cops. \nMR. PINK No real people? \nMR. WHITE Uh-uh, just cops. \nMR. PINK Could you believe Mr. Blonde? \nMR. WHITE That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? \nMR. WHITE For all I know, you're the rat. \nMR. PINK Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat. \nMr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's expression changes. \nMR. WHITE Jesus Christ! \n11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThey run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him first. \nMR. PINK Is he dead? \nMr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse on Mr. Orange's neck. \nMR. PINK So, is he dead or what? \nMR. WHITE He ain't dead. \nMR. PINK So what is it? \nMR. WHITE I think he's just passed out. \nMR. PINK He scared the fuckin shit outta me.  I thought he was dead fer sure. \nMr. White stands up and walks over to a table. \nMR. WHITE He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital. \nMR. PINK We can't take him to a hospital. \nMR. WHITE Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault.  Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.  And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die. \nMR. PINK Well, first things first, staying here's goofy.  We gotta book up. \nMR. WHITE So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain. \nMR. PINK You gotta idea, spit it out. \nMR. WHITE Joe could help him.  If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. \nDuring Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr. White. \nMR. PINK (OS) Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him?  He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here.  Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.  If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible. \nMR. WHITE Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital.  Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead.  He begged me to do it.  I told him to hold off till Joe got here. \nMR. PINK (OS) Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're on our own.  Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em. \nMR. WHITE I don't know anybody. \nMR. PINK (OS) Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital.  Since he don't know nothin about us, I say it's his decision. \nMR. WHITE'S POV: \nMR. WHITE You almost killed me, asshole!  If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you. \nMR. BLONDE You gonna back all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite? \nMR. WHITE What was that?  I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.  Would you repeat it? \nMR. BLONDE (slowly) I said: \"Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite.\" \nMR. PINK Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down! \nMR. WHITE (to Mr. Blonde) So you wanna git bit, huh? \nMR. PINK Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin playground! (pause) I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional.  You guys act like a bunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers?  They're just like you two, always fightin, always sayin they're gonna kill one another. \nMR. WHITE (to Mr. Pink) You said yourself, you thought about takin him out. \nMR. PINK Then.  That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust.  He's too fuckin homicidal to be workin with the cops. \nMR. WHITE You takin his side? \nMR. PINK Fuck sides!  What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle.  Now I know I'm no piece of shit... (referring to Mr. White) And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy... (referring to Mr. Blonde) And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level.  So let's figure out who's the bad guy. \nMr. White calms down and puts his gun away. \nMr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning, talking about Madonna. \nMR. BLONDE Well, that was sure exciting. (to Mr. White) You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't you?  Me too.  I don't know about the rest of you fellas, but my heart's beatin fast. (pause for a beat) Okay you guys, follow me. \nMr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door. \nThe other two men just follow him with their eyes. \nMR. WHITE Follow you where? \nMR. BLONDE Down to my car. \nMR. WHITE Why? \nMR. BLONDE It's a surprise. \nMr. Blonde walks out. \n13     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThree cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind them. \nMR. PINK We still gotta get out of here. \nMR. BLONDE We're gonna sit here and wait. \nMR. WHITE For what, the cops? \nMR. BLONDE Nice Guy Eddie. \nMR. PINK Nice Guy Eddie?  What makes you think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a plane half way to Costa Rica? \nJOE (while he pours the drink) Who's your parole officer? \nVIC A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons. \nJOE How is he? \nVIC Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house. \nJOE Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer.  But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin prick. \nJoe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. \nVic swallows some Remy. \nVIC I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside. \nJOE What the hell did you expect me to do?  Just forget about you? \nVIC I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot. \nJOE It's the least I could do Vic.  I wish I coulda done more. (Joe flashes a side grin at Vic) Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a story?  What're your plans? \nVIC Well, what I wanna do is go back to work.  But I got this Koons prick deep up my ass.  He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nJOE Come in. \nThe door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic turns around in his seat and sees him. \nEDDIE (to Vic) I see ya sittin here, but I don't believe it. \nVic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie. \nEDDIE How ya doin, Toothpick? \nVIC Fine, now. \nEDDIE I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time. \nVIC Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin about. \nEDDIE That I should've picked you up? \nVIC No.  That your head's been up your ass.  I walk through the door and Joe says \"Vic, you're back, thank god.  Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing.  Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up.\"  And I say \"Well, Joe, I coulda told you that.\"  \"I'm ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin toilet!\" (to Joe) I'm not tellin tales out of school.  You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself. \nJOE Eddie, I hate like hell for you to hear it this way.  But when Vic asked me how's business, well, you don't lie to a man who's just done four years in the slammer for ya. \nEddie bobs his head up and down. \nEDDIE Oh really, is that a fact? \nEddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor. \nThe two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle on the floor of Joe's office. \nEDDIE --Nuts.  We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now. \nJOE Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach.  Give ya some cash, get that Koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya. \nEDDIE Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just hear it out.  I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys.  He's been gone for four years.  He ain't on no one's list.  Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him. \nJoe looks at Vic. \nVic has no idea what they're talking about. \nJOE How would you feel about pullin a heist with about five other guys? \nVIC What's the exposure like? \nJOE Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough two minutes.  It's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd.  But you have the fellas to deal with the crowd.  It's a jewelry store. They're getting a big shipment of South African diamonds on a certain day.  They're like a way station.  It's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Hamburg. When you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones. The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em.  Nobody knows anybody else.  Nobody's connected. I don't use connected guys for this shit. \nVIC What's the cut? \nJOE Juicy, man, real juicy. \nToothpick Vic smiles. \nSo does Nice Guy Eddie. \nCUT TO: \n15     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nNice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are coming out of his car radio in the form of \"Love Goes Where My Rosemary Goes\" by Edison Lighthouse. \nEDDIE (into phone) Hey Dov, we got a major situation here. (pause) I know you know that.  I gotta talk with daddy and find out what he wants done. \nFLASH ON \n16     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. \"Love Grows ..\" PLAYS over the soundtrack. \n17     BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE \nEDDIE (into phone) All I know is what Vic told me. He said the place turned into a fuckin bullet festival.  He took a cop as hostage, just to get the fuck out of there. \nFLASH ON \n18     WAREHOUSE \nThe three men are stomping the cop into the ground. \n19     BACK TO EDDIE \nEDDIE (into phone) Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's fuckin driving around with the cop in his trunk. (pause) I don't know who did that.  I don't know who has the loot, if anybody has the loot.  Who's dead, who's alive, who's caught, who's not... I will know, I'm practically there.  But what do I tell these guys about daddy? (pause) You sure that's what he said? (pause) Okay, that's what I'll tell em. \nCUT TO: \n20     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY \nEDDIE I'll call somebody. \nMR. WHITE Who? \nEDDIE A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think.  I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue? \nMR. PINK Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue. \nEDDIE Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue? \nMR. BLONDE Well, he's either dead or he's alive or the cops got him or they don't. \nDOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop. \nEDDIE (OS) I take it this is the bastard you told me about. (referring to the cop) Why the hell are you beating on him? \nMR. PINK So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up. \nEDDIE Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire.  That don't necessarily make it so.  Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit?  Please tell me somebody brought something with them. \nMR. PINK I got a bag.  I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. \nEDDIE Well, let's go get it.  We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. (pointing to Mr. Blonde) You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. (referring to Mr. Pink and Mr. White) You two take a car each, I'll follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones.  And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend. \nMR. WHITE We can't leave these guys with him. \nMeaning Mr. Blonde. \nEDDIE Why not? \nMr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. \nMR. WHITE Because this guy's a fucking psycho.  And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin me in the same room as this bastard. \nMR. BLONDE (to Eddie) You see what I been puttin up with?  As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming \"You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah.\" \nMR. WHITE He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery. (to Mr. Pink) What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin tell him. \nMR. PINK He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store. \nMR. WHITE This is what he was doin. \nMr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the store. \nMR. BLONDE I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it.  I blew 'em full of holes.  If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive. \nMR. WHITE That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage? \nMR. BLONDE I don't like alarms. \nEDDIE What does it matter who stays with the cop?  We ain't lettin him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place. \nMR. PINK We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up. \nEDDIE There is no fuckin set up! (Eddie takes charge) Look, this is the news.  Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two.  White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you. \nThen he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear. \nThe cop/camera moves around wildly. \nMr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see. \nMr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out of the way. \n23     INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT \nWe follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse... \n...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of gasoline. \nHe walks back inside the warehouse... \n24     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \n...carrying the can of gas. \nMr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING him not to do this. \nMr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel. \nMr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing: \nMR. BLONDE \"Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right.  Here I am, stuck in the middle with you.\" \nHe moves the match up to the cop... \n...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest. \nThe HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun. \nWe cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon. \nMr. Blonde FALLS down dead. \nMr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody trail behind him. \nWhen he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him. \nMR. ORANGE (feebly) What's your name? \nCOP Jeffrey. \nMR. ORANGE Jeffrey what? \nCOP Jeffrey Andrews. \nMR. ORANGE Listen to me, Jeffrey Andrews.  I'm a cop. \nJEFFREY I know. \nMR. ORANGE (surprised) You do? \nFREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY \nWe are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN. \nFREDDY (O.S.) Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.  He says I should just hang around my apartment and wait for a phone call.  Well after waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin phone, he calls me last night and says Joe's ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen minutes. \nThe freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed and says: \nHOLDAWAY Woo all picked you up? \nFrom here to end we cut back and forth. \nFREDDY Nice Guy.  When we got to the bar... \nHOLDAWAY ...What bar? \nFREDDY The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony name.  My name's Mr. Orange. \nHOLDAWAY You ever seen this motherfucker before? \nFREDDY Who, Mr. White? \nHOLDAWAY Yeah. \nFREDDY No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well. \nHOLDAWAY How can you tell? \nFREDDY The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. \nHOLDAWAY Did the two of you talk? \nFREDDY Me and Mr. White? \nHOLDAWAY Yeah. \nFREDDY A little. \nHOLDAWAY What about? \nFREDDY The Brewers. \nHOLDAWAY The Milwaukee Brewers? \nFREDDY Yeah.  They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em. \nHOLDAWAY Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face. \nHoldaway takes a big bite out of his burger. \nHOLDAWAY (with his mouth full) What kinds questions did Cabot ask? \nFREDDY Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that. \nHoldaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He motions for Freddy to elaborate. \nFREDDY ...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly. \nMR. WHITE What for? \nFREDDY Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail.  She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed.  Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin me, keeps askin me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it.  Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station. \nJOE You're picking the buyer up at the train station?  You're carrying the weed on you? \nFREDDY Yeah, the guy needed it right away.  Don't ask me why.  So we get to the train station, and we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm carrying the weed in one of those carry-on bags, and I gotta take a piss.  So I tell the connection I'll be right back, I'm goin' to the little boys room... \nCUT TO: \n32     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY \nMEDIUM ON FREDDY \nHe walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We move into a CU. \nFREDDY (V.O.) ...So I walk into the men's room, and who's standing there? \nFREEZE FRAME \non Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are on Freddy.  Everyone is frozen. \nFREDDY (V.O.) ...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and a German Shepherd. \nNICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.) They were waiting for you? \nFREDDY (V.O.) No.  They were just a bunch of cops hangin out in the men's room, talkin.  When I walked through the door they all stopped what they were talking about and looked at me. \n33     BACK TO BAR \nECU MR. WHITE \nMR. WHITE That's hard, man.  That's a fuckin hard situation. \n34     BACK TO MEN'S ROOM \nECU GERMAN SHEPHERD \nbarking his head off. \nFREDDY (V.O.) The German Shepherd starts barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I mean it's obvious he's barkin' at me. \nWe do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can hear the dog barking. \nFREDDY (V.O.) Every nerve ending, all of my senses, the blood in my veins, everything I has was screaming, \"Take off, man, just take off, get the fuck outta there!\"  Panic hit me like a bucket of water.  First there was the shock of it--BAM, right in the face!  Then I'm just standin there drenched in panic. \nSLOW MOTION \nCAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs. \nFREDDY (V.O.) And all those sheriffs are lookin at me and they know. They can smell it.  As sure as that fuckin dog cam, they can smell it on me. \nFREEZE FRAME \nC.U. ENTER BUTTON IS PRESSED \nC.U. OF FEMALE COMPUTER OPERATOR, JODIE SEIGEL. \nJODIE This is your life, Lawrence Dimick! \nC.U. OF COMPUTER PRINTER \nprinting out sheet.  The noise of the printer plays loud over the soundtrack. Jodie's hand comes into FRAME and tears sheet from the printer. \nCUT TO: \n36     INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHoldaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look into the CAMERA. \nWe hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN. \nJODIE (OS) Lawrence \"Larry\" Dimick.  Also known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin \"Al\" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe- Armed-Robbery.  He's a pro and he makes it a habit not to get caught. \nMEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE \nDOLLY slowly into C.U. \nJODIE He's only been convicted twice, which is pretty good for somebody living a life of crime.  Once for armed robbery, when he was twenty- one, in Milwaukee. \nC.U. FREDDY \nFREDDY What was it? \nJODIE \nJODIE Payroll office at a lumber yard. First offense - he got eighteen months.  He didn't get busted again until he was thirty-two. And then it was a backdoor bust. A routine vice squad roust.  They roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence is in there knocking down a few. He gets picked up.  He's wearing on his person an outlaw .45 automatic, apparently his weapon of choice.  Also, on his finger is a diamond ring from a jewelry store robbery a year earlier.  He got two years back inside for that. \nTWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY \nFreddy winces. \nFREDDY Goddamn, that's hard time. \nJODIE \nJODIE So far, it's the only time he's ever done. \nCU HOLDAWAY \nHOLDAWAY Was this vice squad bullshit in Milwaukee? \nJODIE \nJODIE No.  The vice squad roust was in L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles since '77. \nDOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK \nfrom left to right. \nThe CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment getting everything he needs.  He puts on his jacket and slips on some sneakers. \nDOLLY fast toward the front door knob.  Freddy's hand comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go.  We MOVE UP to his face. \nFear. \nFREDDY (to himself) Don't pussy out on me now.  They don't know.  They don't know shit. (pause) You're not gonna get hurt.  You're fucking Baretta and they believe every word, cuz you're super cool. \nHe exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and close OFF SCREEN. \n40     EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCOPS' POV \nFrom inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up to Eddie's parked car. \nCOP #1 (OS) There goes our boy. \nCOP #2 (OS) I swear, a guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar to work undercover. \nCOP #1 (OS) Do you want one of these? \nCOP #2 (OS) Yeah, gimme the bear claw. \nFreddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic. \nCop #1 starts the engine and follows. \n41     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nNice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is in the passenger seat.  Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat together. \nMR. PINK ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin about, black women ain't the same as white women. \nMR. WHITE (sarcastically) There's a slight difference. \nThe car laughs. \nMR. PINK Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean.  What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute.  They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up. \nEDDIE I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this.  I've seen it happen. \nMR. WHITE Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit? \nMR. PINK I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out. \nMR. WHITE Not these guys. \nMR. PINK Yeah, those guys too. \nEDDIE Let me tell you guys a story.  In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois. \nMR. WHITE Elois? \nEDDIE Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We called her Lady E. \nMR. WHITE (VO) Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue? \nFREDDY (VO) Crowd control.  They handle customers and employees in the display area. \n46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY \nMr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street from the jewelry store, staking it out. \nMR. WHITE Myself and Mr. Pink? \nFREDDY You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds.  We're there for those stones, period.  Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off.  We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer.  What if the manager won't give up the diamonds? \nMR. WHITE When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass.  They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever.  If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose.  Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin shit after that.  You might get some bitch talk shit to ya.  But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next.  Watch her shut the fuck up.  Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around.  So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy.  So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two.  If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers.  The little one.  Then you tell 'im his thumb's next.  After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get a taco. \nCUT TO: \n47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY \nIt's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty. \nIn the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass BREAKING... \nA car whips around the corner, into the alley. \nThe doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out. \nFreddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING Mr. Brown FALLS out. \nMR. BROWN (screaming) My eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm fucking blind! \nFREDDY You're not blind, there's just blood in your eyes. \nMr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT. \nFIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the patrol car. \nFreddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr. White's ambush in shock. \nMr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes. \nMR. BROWN Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange, aren't you? \nBy the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown is dead. \nMr. White RUNS up to Freddy. \nMR. WHITE Is he dead? \nFreddy doesn't answer, he can't. \nMR. WHITE Did he did or not? \nFreddy, scared. \nFREDDY I'm sorry. \nEDDIE Hey, it's the best I could do. \nMR. WHITE The man is fucking dying. \nEDDIE And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll take care of him. \nMR. WHITE He needs a doctor, not a fuckin nurse. \nEDDIE Ask me how many doctors I called. You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors I called. \nMR. WHITE Obviously not enough. \nEDDIE Fuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment. \nMR. WHITE If he dies I'm holding you personally responsible. \nEDDIE Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.  I don't think she'll call the cops, but I don't know for sure.  But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it.  But no fuckin more. (he grabs his portable phone) I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin her to forget it.  You take care of your friend, you know so much about it. \nMR. PINK Goddamnit, will you guys grow up! \nEDDIE I don't need to grow up, my friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm being responsible, I'm taking care of business. \nMR. WHITE Cut the shit!  I don't think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked, who happens to wear orthopedic shoes.  And I don't think that's good enough care for a gut-shot man. \nEDDIE Yeah, well I don't give a flying fuck what you think! \nMR. PINK (to Mr. White) Look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him.  She's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. Nobody's forgotten about doctors. Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is something we're doing in the meantime.  I think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes. \nEDDIE Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I leave myself wide open, and I'm an asshole. \n50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks. \nWe see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot. \nEDDIE What the fuck happened here? \nEddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic. \nMR. WHITE (to Mr. Orange) What happened? \nMR. ORANGE (very weakly) Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. \nEDDIE (yelling) Who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig? \nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once more. \nEDDIE (to Mr. Orange) You were saying he went crazy? Something like that?  Worse or better? \nMR. ORANGE Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn. He was gonna kill the cop and me. And when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds. \nMR. WHITE (to Eddie) Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho. \nMR. ORANGE (to Eddie) You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him.  He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up. \nMR. WHITE (very calmly to Joe) Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong. \nJOE Like hell I am. \nMR. WHITE (very calmly) Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake.  He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin pissed.  We're all real emotional.  But you're barking up the wrong tree.  I know this man, and he wouldn't do that. \nJOE You don't know jack shit.  I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed. \nMR. PINK Mr. Blue's dead? \nJOE Dead as Dillinger. \nEDDIE The motherfucker killed Vic. \nMR. WHITE How do you know all this? \nJOE He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on.  I should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when I wasn't a hundred percent.  But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. \nMR. WHITE (screaming) That's your proof? \nJOE You don't need proof when you got instinct.  I ignored it before, but not no more. \nHe WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange. \nMr. White brings his .45 up at Joe. \nEddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms. \nEddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White. \nEDDIE Have you lost your fucking mind? Put your gun down! \nMr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this. \nMR. WHITE Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make. \nEDDIE Stop pointing your fuckin gun at daddy! \nJoe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange. \nJOE Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot.  We like each other too much. \nMR. WHITE Joe, if you kill that man, you die next.  Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next! \nWe get many different angles of the Mexican standoff. \nMEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY \nMr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right. \nJoe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off him. \nMr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start firing any minute. \nEddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr. White. \n", "test1_input": "MR. WHITE You're not gonna fucking die, all right? \nMR. ORANGE I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad. \nMR. WHITE It's not good... \nMR. ORANGE Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do.  I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now.  The situation is, I'm shot in the belly.  And without medical attention, I'm gonna die. \nMR. WHITE I can' take you to a hospital. \nMR. ORANGE Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit about jail.  But I can't die.  You don't have to take me in.  Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk.  I'll take care of myself.  I won't tell them anything.  I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything.  Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes. (Mr. White does) I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe. \nMR. WHITE Lie back down, and try to-- \nMR. ORANGE I'm going to die!   I need a doctor!  I'm begging you, take me to a doctor. \nMr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself: \nMR. ORANGE Take me to a doctor, take me to a doctor, please. \nSuddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps inside. \nMR. PINK Was that a fucking set-up or what? \nMr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody. \nMR. PINK Oh fuck, Orange got tagged. \nThroughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning. \nMR. WHITE Gun shot. \nMR. PINK Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown? \nMR. WHITE Dead. \nMR. PINK Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die? \nMR. WHITE How the fuck do you think?  The cops shot him. \nMR. PINK Oh this is bad, this is so bad. (referring to Mr. Orange) Is it bad? \nMR. WHITE As opposed to good? \nMR. PINK This is so fucked up.  Somebody fucked us big time. \nMR. WHITE You really think we were set up? \nMR. PINK You even doubt it?  I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!  I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh?  One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there.  I didn't hear any sirens.  The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time.  Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.  In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there.  All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there!  Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm.  but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us. (pause) You haven't thought about this? \nMR. WHITE I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there.  And after we got away, I've just been dealin with him. \nMR. PINK Well, you better start thinking about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it.  In fact, that's all I'm thinking about.  I came this close to just driving off.  Whoever set us up, knows about this place.  There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me.  For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now. \nMR. WHITE Let's go in the other room... \n", "test1_true": "5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY \nAt the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view. \nMR. PINK (OS) What the fuck am I doing here?  I felt funny about this job right off.  As soon as I felt it I should said \"No thank you\", and walked.  But I never fucking listen.  Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right.  I just felt it.  But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby.  But it's never Thai stick. and I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk.  And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin money! \nMR. WHITE What's done is done, I need you cool.  Are you cool? \nMR. PINK I'm cool. \nMR. WHITE Splash some water on your face. Take a breather. \nWe hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on his face. \nMR. WHITE I'm gonna get me my smokes. \nMr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in his hand. \nMR. WHITE Want a smoke? \nMR. PINK Why not? \nThe two men light up. \nMR. WHITE Okay, let's go through what happened.  We're in the place, everything's going fine.  Then the alarm gets tripped.  I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam!  I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all the-- \nMR. PINK --That's not correct. \nMR. WHITE What's wrong with it? \nMR. PINK The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off.  They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone. \nMR. WHITE As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops. \nMR. PINK I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon.  They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin they weren't there, I'm sayin they were there.  But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman.  That's how I know we were set up.  You can see that, can't you, Mr. White? \nMR. WHITE Look, enough of this \"Mr White\" shit-- \nMR. PINK --Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know!  I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine. \nMR. WHITE You're right, this is bad. (pause) How did you get out? \nMR. PINK Shot my way out.  Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there. \nCUT TO: \n6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY \nMr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357 MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right along side of him. \nFOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with them. \nWe DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and skating backwards to the beat of the song. \nRollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The man and woman CRASH to the ground. \n", "test1_id": 1845, "test2_input": "Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS: \nMR. PINK Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna fuck with me?!  I'll show you who you're fuckin with! \nThe two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. \nMr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK. \nMr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it out. \nMr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and goes for his own weapon. \nThe two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another. \nMR. WHITE You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit?  Take a shot! \nMR. PINK Fuck you, White!  I didn't create this situation,  I'm just dealin with it.  You're acting like a first-year fuckin thief.  I'm actin like a professional.  They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen.  And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault.  I didn't tell him my name.  I didn't tell him where I was from.  I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name.  You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created.  So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror. \nMr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White. \nMR. PINK So if you wanna shoot somebody, put that gun in your mouth and shoot yourself. \nThen from OFF SCREEN we hear: \nVOICE (OS) You kids don't play so rough. Somebody's gonna start crying. \n12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE \nThe Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde. \nMr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog. \nMR. PINK Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought you might've gotten caught.  What happened? \nMr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out. \nHe doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just eats his hot dog and sips his coke. \nThis is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr. Pink tries to talk through it. \nWe HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse. \nMR. PINK Really, how did you get away? \nMr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent. \nMR. PINK You saw what happened to me, I found a hole and booked. \nSilence. \nMR. PINK Where's Mr. Blue? \nBlonde looks in the bathroom. \nMR. PINK We were hopin you two would be together. \n", "test2_true": "MR. PINK That was the big question we had, what happened to Mr. Blue and you? \nBlonde walks away from the window. \nMR. PINK We were worried the cops got ya. \nBlonde bends down over Mr. Orange. \nMR. PINK He got it in the belly.  He's still alive, but won't be for long. \nMR. WHITE Enough!  You better start talkin to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about.  We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin bag on our hip. \nMr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves towards them. \nMR. BLONDE So, talk. \nMR. WHITE We think we got a rat in the house. \nMR. PINK I guarantee we got a rat in the house. \nMR. BLONDE What would ever make you think that? \nMR. WHITE Is that supposed to be funny? \nMR. PINK We don't think this place is safe. \nMR. WHITE This place just ain't secure anymore.  We're leaving, and you should go with us. \nMR. BLONDE Nobody's going anywhere. \nSilence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving. \nAfter a few beats the silence is broken. \nMR. WHITE (to Mr. Pink) Piss on this turd, we're outta here. \nMr. White turns to leave. \nMR. BLONDE Don't take another step, Mr. White. \nMr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. Blonde. \nMR. WHITE Fuck you, maniac!  It's your fuckin fault we're in so much trouble. \nMr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink. \nMR. BLONDE (referring to Mr. White) What's this guy's problem? \nMR. WHITE What's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta problem.  I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot! \nMR. BLONDE What're you talkin about? \nMR. WHITE That fuckin shooting spree in the store. \nMR. BLONDE Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got. \n", "test2_id": 1846, "test3_input": "CU ON JOE \nJOE (in a good Brooklyn accent) \"That's nothin.  When I take the tip of my tongue and wiggle it against my Mary Louise's little fun pimple, she rises two feet off da bed.\"  Then our friend from Poland says: (in dumb voice) \"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When I get through fuckin my Sophie, I wipe my dick on the curtains and you know what?  She hits the roof!\" \nJoe laughs like a crazy man. \nJOE Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! \nWe hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN. \nJOE Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on the drapes. \nJoe's eyes greet the new arrivals. \nJOE You're here, great! \nJoe EXITS C.U. \nWe now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table. A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to the right. \nWe do a 360 around the men. \nEDDIE We woulda gotten here sooner, but we got backed up around La Brea and Pico. \nJOE No hurry. (to the boys) All right, let's get to know one another.  With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed.  You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done.  Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do.  This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself.  And that's the way I like it.  Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with.  You don't know any names.  You know my name, you know Eddie's name.  That I don't care about.  You gotta prove it.  I ain't worried.  Besides, this way you gotta trust me.  I like that.  I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you.  I know you.  I know your work, I know your reputation.  I know you as men.  Except for this guy. \nJoe points a finger at Freddy. \nFreddy shits a brick. \nJOE But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... (Joe searches for the right words) ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly. (pointing at the men as he gives them a name) Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink. \nMR. PINK Why am I Mr. Pink? \nJOE Cause you're a faggot. \nEverybody laughs. \nMR. PINK Why can't we pick out our own colors? \nJOE I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down.  So forget it, I pick.  Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow. \nMR. BROWN Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too close to Mr. Shit. \nEverybody laughs. \nMR. PINK Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple. \nJOE You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink. \nMR. WHITE Who cares what your name is?  Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss... \nMR. PINK Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta cool-sounding name.  So tell me, Mr. White, if you think \"Mr. Pink\" is no big deal, you wanna trade? \nJOE Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting!  Listen up Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here, my way or the highway.  And you can go down either of 'em.  So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink? \n", "test3_true": "CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store on it. \nJOE (OS) Okay fellas, let's get into this. \nCUT TO: \n44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY \nFreddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field. \nHOLDAWAY Okay, we're gonna station men across the street from Karina's Fine Jewelry.  But their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control.  You gotta make sure they don't have to move in.  You're inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle.  We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous.  They got complete visibility of the exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we'll see it. \nFREDDY What's your visibility of the interior? \nHOLDAWAY We can't see shit on the inside. And we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us. \nFREDDY This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety. \nHOLDAWAY What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job too tough for ya?  No one lied to you.  You always knew we'd hang back until Joe Cabot showed up. \nFREDDY Oh this is great.  You ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever.  But you are giving me an attitude. \nHOLDAWAY Since when does an undercover cop have protection?  Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now.  I understand you're nervous.  I wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't.  We have to make do with the cards we're dealt. \nFREDDY I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it. I'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is! \nHOLDAWAY I don't mean to be harsh with ya, but I've found tough love works best in these situations.  We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. We don't care about these other bastards.  We're willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot. \nFREDDY Isn't this risk unorthodox? \nHOLDAWAY What? \nFREDDY Letting them go ahead with the robbery? \nHOLDAWAY The whole idea behind this operation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed.  We bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit. Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs are very clean.  We got people surrounding the perimeter.  We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings.  We could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off. \nFREDDY That's out.  They know the faces of who works what shift. \nHOLDAWAY These guys are professionals. We're professionals.  It's a risk, but I think it's a calculated risk. \n45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY \nWe see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store. \nCUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on customers through the windows. \nWhile we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN. \nMR. WHITE (VO) Let's go over it.  Where are you? \nFREDDY (VO) I stand outside and guard the door.  I don't let anybody come in or go out. \nMR. WHITE (VO) Mr. Brown? \nFREDDY (VO) Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store. \n", "test3_id": 1847}

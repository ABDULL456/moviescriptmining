{"test1_input": "MR. BLONDE Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips. \nMR. WHITE Fuck all that. \nThey all laugh. \nMR. WHITE Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up.  But that ain't my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.  But what I won't do is play ball.

WRITE Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know what you're talking about.  So if you're through giving me your amateur opinion, lie back and listen to the news.  I'm taking you back to the rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you up, and you're gonna be okay.  Now say it: you're gonna be okay.  Say it: you're gonna be okay! \nMr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on the steering wheel. \nMR. WHITE Say-the-goddamn-words: you're gonna be okay! \nMR. ORANGE I'm okay. \nMR.

WHITE Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on, and wait for Joe.  I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe.  Who are we waiting for? \nMR. ORANGE Joe. \nMR.

Also known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin \"Al\" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe- Armed-Robbery.  He's a pro and he makes it a habit not to get caught. \nMEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE \nDOLLY slowly into C.U. \nJODIE He's only been convicted twice, which is pretty good for somebody living a life of crime.  Once for armed robbery, when he was twenty- one, in Milwaukee. \nC.U. FREDDY \nFREDDY What was it? \nJODIE \nJODIE Payroll office at a lumber yard. First offense - he got eighteen months.  He didn't get busted again until he was thirty-two. And then it was a backdoor bust. A routine vice squad roust.  They roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence is in there knocking down a few. He gets picked up.  He's wearing on his person an outlaw .45 automatic, apparently his weapon of choice.  Also, on his finger is a diamond ring from a jewelry store robbery a year earlier.  He got two years back inside for that. \nTWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY \nFreddy winces. \nFREDDY Goddamn, that's hard time. \nJODIE \nJODIE So far, it's the only time he's ever done. \nCU HOLDAWAY \nHOLDAWAY Was this vice squad bullshit in Milwaukee? \nJODIE \nJODIE No.  The vice squad roust was in L.A.

I found something else out I think you two should be aware of. About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job.  Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop. Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party.  The door opens, everyone yells \"Surprise!\", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody knows what's going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two .45 automatics into the crowd. \nHOLDAWAY What happened? \nThe DOLLY moves behind Jodie. \nJODIE It was a mess.  Cops got hit, wives got hit, girlfriends got hit, his dog got hit.  People got glass in their faces.  Three were killed, six were wounded. \nFREDDY They couldn't pin the killing on one of the bank robbers? \nJODIE They tried, but they didn't have a positive I.D. and all those guys had alibis.  Besides, we really didn't have anything on them.  We had the testimony of a dead man that they were talking about committing a robbery.  They never went ahead with the bank job. \nThe DOLLY completes its circle. \nFREDDY And Larry Dimick was one of the boys? \nJODIE He was probably the one. \nON HOLDAWAY \nHOLDAWAY Just how sure are you with your cover? \nPAN to C.U. on Freddy. \nFREDDY Today they may know something, tomorrow they may know something else.

You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors I called. \nMR. WHITE Obviously not enough. \nEDDIE Fuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment. \nMR. WHITE If he dies I'm holding you personally responsible. \nEDDIE Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.  I don't think she'll call the cops, but I don't know for sure.  But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it.  But no fuckin more. (he grabs his portable phone) I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin her to forget it.  You take care of your friend, you know so much about it. \nMR. PINK Goddamnit, will you guys grow up! \nEDDIE I don't need to grow up, my friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm being responsible, I'm taking care of business. \nMR. WHITE Cut the shit!  I don't think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked, who happens to wear orthopedic shoes.  And I don't think that's good enough care for a gut-shot man. \nEDDIE Yeah, well I don't give a flying fuck what you think! \nMR. PINK (to Mr. White) Look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him.  She's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. Nobody's forgotten about doctors. Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is something we're doing in the meantime.  I think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes. \nEDDIE Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I leave myself wide open, and I'm an asshole. \n50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks. \nWe see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot. \nEDDIE What the fuck happened here? \nEddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic. \nMR. WHITE (to Mr. Orange) What happened? \nMR. ORANGE (very weakly) Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. \nEDDIE (yelling) Who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig? \nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once more. \nEDDIE (to Mr. Orange) You were saying he went crazy? Something like that?  Worse or better? \nMR. ORANGE Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn. He was gonna kill the cop and me. And when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds. \nMR. WHITE (to Eddie) Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho. \nMR. ORANGE (to Eddie) You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him.

Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did. \nMr. Pink walks over to the cop's body. \nMR. PINK He's right about the ear, it's hacked off. \nEDDIE (to Mr. Orange) Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you.  Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram.  That's your story? I'm correct about that, right? \nMR. ORANGE Eddie, you can believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth.  I swear on my mother's eternal soul that's what happened. \nThe CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie. \nThere's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has said.  Finally: \nEDDIE You're a fuckin liar.  Now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened? \nMR. WHITE (OS) He told you what really happened. You just can't deal with it. \nMR. ORANGE (OS) Okay, you're right, I'm lying. Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm not above pullin a fast one.  Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that, I shot him 'cause I didn't like his hair style.  I didn't like his shoes either.  If it has just been his hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said, let him live.  But hair and footwear together, he's a goner. \nEDDIE The man you killed was just released from prison.  He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.  He could've walked away.  All he had to do was say my dad's name.  But instead he shut his mouth and did his time.  He did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man.  And we were very grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off? \nSilence. \nEDDIE Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me what really happened? \nVOICE (OS) Why?  It'll just be more bullshit. \nEddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing in the warehouse doorway.

ESCORTING OFFICER Roth, Brewer. 
Tyler glares at Aidan. 
AIDAN Yeah, I called your dad's office. Sue me. 
18   INT. FAR ROCKAWAY - CRAIG FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN -- MORNING   18 
Ally, with a cup of coffee, is on the house phone. 
ALLY So when would that be available?...No, that's sooner than I'd thought. And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay. 
Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink. 
ALLY I'll call you back. Thanks. 
Ally hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water. 
On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug. 
She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee. 
ALLY What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight? 
The toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear. 
CRAIG Breathe. 
ALLY Did you? 
CRAIG I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that? 
ALLY The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember? 
Beat. 
CRAIG Sure. 
Ally grabs her sweatshirt. 
ALLY Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me. 
CRAIG I'll drive you. 
She flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and the English Muffin. Craig dries his hands, grabs his jacket and a set of keys from the counter. 
19   EXT. DRIVEWAY.                                               19 
Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of red-brick row houses. 
Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag. 
Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys across the roof. She drops them in her bag. 
ALLY Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it. 
Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car. 
She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup. 
ALLY You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench. 
They start to back out. 
ALLY This drive is too long. 
20   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- DAY                     20 
Tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area. English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Draws the ire of... 
THE RECEPTIONIST You know you can't smoke in here. 
Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him. It's clearly never been used. 
TYLER So what's with the ash tray? 
THE RECEPTIONIST It completes the room. 
Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the pristine surface. He smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman. 
TYLER Tease. 
JANINE O/S Tyler... 
JANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway.

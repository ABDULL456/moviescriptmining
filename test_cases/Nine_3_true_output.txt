GUIDO Thank you. 
LUISA For what? 
GUIDO Thank you. For what I'm looking at. (walking away) Keep running. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Luisa is now at the top of the staircase. She looks at Guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs. 
LUISA LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO. HOW HE NEEDS ME SO, AND HE'LL BE THE LAST TO KNOW IT. MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES. TO MAKE THEM HE MAKES HIMSELF OBSESSED. HE WORKS FOR WEEKS ON END WITHOUT A BIT OF REST- NO OTHER WAY CAN HE ACHIEVE HIS LEVEL BEST. SOME MEN READ BOOKS, SOME SHINE THEIR SHOES, SOME RETIRE EARLY, SOME STAY UP TO DREAM AND MUSE. MY HUSBAND ONLY RARELY COMES TO BED - MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES... 
INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
In reality, Luisa sees Carla enter the restaurant. They look at each other. Carla tries to change direction, or look as if she's come to the wrong place. 
...Luisa gets up abruptly. 
LUISA Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired. 
She hurries away. Guido senses something terrible is happening. He gets up and goes after his wife. p. 55 
EXT. STEPS, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT 
Guido catches up to Luisa as she storms up the steps. 
GUIDO Luisa! 
LUISA I'm staggered by my own stupidity.    I could vomit. 
GUIDO Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened? 
LUISA You open your mouth and a lie comes out. 
GUIDO What lie? 
LUISA Why am I surprised? - it's like breathing to you. 
She walks away up the steps. Guido can only guess at what's happened. He heads back to the terrace restaurant... 
INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table. She sees him and calls for him. 
CARLA Guido. 
Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door. 
INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT 
Guido pulls Carla through the lobby. She's humiliated. 
CARLA (trying to explain) I was hungry. I'm tired of eating alone in that room. 
GUIDO There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56 
CARLA I wanted to see the hotel. I told you I came here with my parents when I was little. I didn't come to disturb you. 
GUIDO Well you certainly managed to. 
CARLA Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going to be here! 
GUIDO I didn't know she was here.   She just turned up.

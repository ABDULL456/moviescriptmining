He hesitates in the doorway as the two women rush to the TV which is already on, the station showing live coverage of the bank robbery.  On SCREEN, Sonny can be seen ordering the cops around.  Moretti looks furious.

TV NEWSMAN ...Mrs. Ball, is everyone all right in the bank? 
HUSBAND Why rob a bank when you got a sucker for a mother? 
SYLVIA Oh, yeah, the one girl was cryin', but we're havin' a ball, so far, if just nobody shoots... 
VI Why didn't he tell me? 
NEWSMAN What about the man inside the bank? What is he doing? 
HUSBAND I just hope he gives the wrong name. 
He reaches for TV to turn it off.  Vi stops him. 
SYLVIA Sal?  He never talks, only goes: 'Sonny, you want me to shoot that one, this one.' 
HUSBAND Is that all there is -- that little bastard down there in the bank? 
TV NEWSMAN Mrs. Ball, do you think they might shoot, if they get desperate? 
VI You got money for the subway? 
SYLVIA Hey, wait, he's goin' back in. (she turns OUT OF PICTURE) 
FAT WOMAN Subway!  It's a special occasion -- take a cab, for God's sake!

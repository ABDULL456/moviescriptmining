Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He repeats the operation with the other palm. 
He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous parody of Christ's stigmata. 
PINHEAD I am the Way. 
The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead. 
PRIEST You'll burn in Hell for this! 
The Priest reaches him.  Pinhead's hand is on his throat instantly, squeezing silence from him. 
PINHEAD Burn?  What a limited imagination. 
The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to his knees before him. 
Pinhead towers over the Priest.  He smiles. 
With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from the decorative wounds on his chest.  He holds the bloody piece of meat up. 
PINHEAD This is my body.  This is my blood. Happy are they who come to my supper. 
Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh into the Priest's aghast mouth. 
Pinhead flings the priest away from him. 
The Priest lands heavily on the floor. 
Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside. 
All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing through the Church. 
Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest. 
And all the candles go out. 
BLACKNESS 
INT/EXT   JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS   NIGHT 
Joey is driving again.  And this time she's not even stopping at red lights.  She steams across junctions, leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake. 
Something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side. 
JOEY (appalled) Oh God ... 
JOEY'S (MOVING) POV 
Up a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church.  It's on fire. 
Joey swings the car up the hill. 
SMASH-CUT TO: 
Joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church.  Off to her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall. 
Joey shakes her head at the desecration.  She has no doubt who's responsible. 
JOEY Having fun en route, you bastard. 
Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her. 
Joey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round. 
JOEY'S POV - SHOCK REVEAL 
The Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the side wall of the smaller building.  Pinhead's nails protrude from his palms and his ankles. 
EXT   CITY STREETS   NIGHT 
A SERIES of QUICK CUTS of Joey's car tearing through the darkness heading back to her apartment. 
INT.   CORRIDOR, JOEY'S APT. BLDG.   NIGHT 
Joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly turns the lock and rushes in.

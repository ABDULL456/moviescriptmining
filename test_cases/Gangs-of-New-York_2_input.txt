CUT TO 
47 EXT. BROADWAY DAY 
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main thoroughfare. 
JENNY Are you a spy, then? 
AMSTERDAM Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say. 
JENNY Appreciator of what? 
AMSTERDAM A good touch. 
She STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye. 
JENNY Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I do it or not. 
AMSTERDAM Just take a minute, I was Just... 
JENNY I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with anyone's rules but my own. AMSTERDAM What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day, the better his. It don't seem gute right. 
JENNY (a little curious now) What's it to you? 
AMSTERDAM Give him this. 
He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the same one she gave Shang. 
AMSTERDAM 
And you can keep a little more of what you earned. 
JENNY How'd you come by this? 
AMSTERDAM I got my own touch. 
JENNY Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement? 
AMSTERDAM It's your rules, right? So you decide. 
She looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her neck like a kerchief. 
CUT TO 
48 INT. HIDEOUT 
A gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches them both. 
Shang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck. 
SHANG Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that? 
JENNY From Amsterdam. 
SHANG (beat) It don't suit you. 
CUT TO 
49 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT 
A SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS. Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and whores. 
JACK Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions. 
CITIZEN Nothing but our safety, of course. 
JACK All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there. 
He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS. 
The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution... a service of Tammany Hall." As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.' 
JACK Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe. 
WOMAN CITIZEN (apprehensive) Even against them? 
A small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation, come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for action 
JACK Against them especially. Let me demonstrate. 
Jack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off. 
JACK We'll be back for this at our leisure. 
WOMAN CITIZEN You dare leave it here? 
JACK Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine. 
The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ... but 
Shang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly. 
SHANG You know that's Jack's. 
BOY So what? 
AMSTERDAM It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag. SHANG That watch is a small price for free run of the Points. 
AMSTERDAM If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due. 
SHANG We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts. It's the living day to day.

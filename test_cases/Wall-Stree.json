{"test1_input": "BUD (coming right back) Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I do. The breakup value is twice the market price. The deal finances itself. Sell off two divisions, keep... \nAiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest. \nGEKKO (laughs) Not bad for a quant, but a dog with different fleas. (checks his hi-tech watch) Come on, tell me something I don't know. It's my birthday, pal, surprise me... \nAs he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In frustration, Bud blurts it out. \nBUD (standing) Bluestar Airlines. \nThe camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him. \nGEKKO ...rings a bell somewhere. So what? \nBUD A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities... \nGEKKO ...don't like airlines, lousy unions... \nBUD There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know. \nGekko looks up, remotely interested. \nGEKKO How do you know? \nBUD (hesitates, concerned) I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop. \nOllie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan. \nOLLIE ... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag. \nGEKKO Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie. \nOLLIE And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada. \nGEKKO Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. (to Bud) Interesting. You got a card? \nBuddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it. \nBUD My home number's on the back... \nGEKKO (smiles, looks at card) Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one. \nBud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence. \nBUD Well, hope to hear from you, sir. \nHe turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a dossier. \nGekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears: \nGEKKO (off) OK gang, looks like we're going over 5% in Teldar, start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D, we keep going after everything in sight but don't pay over $22. They're gonna fight, they got Myers and Thromberg doing their legal, they make Nazis look like nice guys... \nINT. OUTSIDE GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it. She's busy on the phone. \nBUD ...thanks Natalie. \nNATALIE (buzzing inside, preoccupied) ...have a nice day Mr. Stone. (wrong name, doesn't notice, to Gekko on phone) ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on. \nThe phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out, dejected. \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar Paper comes up. \nMARV (comes over) ...well, see him? \nBUD (mind on the computer) Yeah, but he didn't see me. \nMARV Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle. \nINSERT: TELDAR PAPER. The quotron. Bud's eyes. Thinking to buy. \nMARV (looks) ... got something from him? Teldar Paper? \n", "test1_true": "BUD ...a dog with fleas. \nLynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes. \nLYNCH Where you been the last 3 hours, Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around chin wagging if I were you... plenty of names in that phone book to cold call... \nMarvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back. Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book. \nMARV ...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say? \nBUD (shakes his head) ...gotta read my reports. \nMARV Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there. \nTheir eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated. \nBUD ...preferably Lou Mannheim... \nTheir eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office, sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the quotron. \nMARV Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan? \nBUD Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. (hitting the phone with the directory) \nThe pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out. \nGINA Call for you Buddy. \nBUD (taking it) Bud Fox. \nBud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices. \nINT. GORDON GEKKO OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS - DAY \nGekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window. \nGEKKO Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty thousand shares of Bluestar. No more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and don't screw it up sport. \nINT. BUD'S CUBICLE - DAY \nThe camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud. Dumbstruck. \nBUD Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't regret it. \nHe hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket. \nMARV Got a little action there, eh buddy? \nBUD Marv, (turns triumphant) ...I just bagged the elephant! \nEXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT \nThe upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now, past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear. \nINT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT \nInside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops, everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types. \nYOUNG TRADER ...you know Marty Wyndham? He netted $650,000 out of that merger...26 years old, the guy's Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a house in Westhampton, penthouse on Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in the morning, he's in the office at 4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes... \nHe blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone. \nBud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer. \nBUD (awkward) Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight. \nBLONDE (disdainful) Please, no thanks... (looking away) \nBUD Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old. \nBLONDE Oh really. \nBUD (CONT'D) I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink? \n", "test1_id": 2499, "test2_input": "BUD (remembering) Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday. \nCARL (laughs at his new lifestyle) Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. \nBUD ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear? \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time. \nTickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt. \nBud calls in his order: \"10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know how the options are opening.\" \nMusic skips along in a revolving madcap fashion. \nINT. FLOOR OF AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY \nA CLERK hands the buy order to the FLOOR MANAGER. He starts writing a ticket as we pull back: \nINT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY \nCompany floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth, frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines. \nThe FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of the labyrinthian room. \nAs in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order. \nThe camera moves up as the Anacott Steel (AN STL) quote flashes across the broad tape -- as the price ticks up from 46 to 46 1/4. \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another order. \nINT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY \nThe SAME RUNNER races over, handing Bud's next TICKET to the COMPANY TRADER. \nTilt up to the broad tape. \nAs ANACOTT STEEL, AN STL, rises to 48 1/8. \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nOn Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone. Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report. When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49. \nINT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY \nOn the tired RUNNER dodging through the crowd, and over to the TRADER handing him a new ticket. \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nClose on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50. \nBuddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to Marv who is on the phone, cold calling. \nMARV Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important financial news! It concerns his future. \nBud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off. \nMARV What the hell... \nBUD Anacott Steel. Buy it. \nMarv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's never seen before. \nMARV (nervous) Anacott Steel -- right. \nBud leaves, Marv re-dials. \nMARV Dr. Beltzer, you're gonna love this! \nLou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look. Bud leans into his office. \nBUD Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. (whispering) Anacott Steel. \n", "test2_true": "BUD You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things. \nMANNHEIM Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud. \nBUD It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. (exits) \nCharlie Cushing's on the phone. \nCHARLIE Gotcha baby, its do-able... meet you at the Wyatt Club... 3pm Dinner Thursday... Indochina. Then we'll kamikaze down to Nell's, chase a little cotton underwear--I know this 18 year old bimbo, man... you can take it to the bank... (hangs up) \nBUD (intersects) Wanna play some tennis Saturday? \nCHARLIE You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client... \nBUD (disappointed) ...you take that Anacott Steel? \nCHARLIE (winks) ...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up... \nDan Steeples's talking confidentially on the phone. \nSTEEPLES I've just heard the most lovely two words... 'Anacott Steel.' \nBuddy dialing the phone number that Gekko gave him. He speaks into the receiver, in a hushed voice. \nBUD ...Blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel. (hangs up) \nINT. WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICE - DAY \nThe REPORTER on the other end of the phone hangs up. He rises from his desk, strides across the busy news floor, over to an ASSOCIATE. \nREPORTER Anacott Steel's in play. Check the arbs. \nEXT. GEKKO BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - TWILIGHT \nWind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic. \nGEKKO (V.O.) Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks more in a convertible preferred. And 5 year contracts for themselves. \nINT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - DAY \nImmense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures, floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond. \nGEKKO (CONT'D) (on the phone) ... Cromwell wants to play financial chicken with me, we'll see who swerves first. Where the hell's Gene? \nGekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of several news reports he master-controls with a remote. \nSUSAN (on phone) You sent him to Vermont to get the deposition from the CEO Cromwell fired. \nGEKKO ...done and done. Night gang, and Susan no legs waving in the air tonight. I want you dreaming about Teldar Paper. \nDuring this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car. Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby. \nGEKKO Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie! \nThe kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap. \nRUDY Daddy bad boy! Bad boy! -- play with Wudi... Now! \nGEKKO No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making money to buy you toys. Daddy work. \nRUDY Daddy work bad boy! \nGordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the TV. The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car. \nBUSINESS ANALYST ...the big story tonight is Anacott Steel which closed at 51 1/8.  Up 5 1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy trading... \nKate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed AU PAIR GIRL from France... just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it stalls, engines grinding. \nKATE I think somebody's playing hooky from the bathtub. Rudy, say good night DAddy... \nGEKKO (can't hear, to Kate) Shut that off, willya! \nKate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out of the car. \n", "test2_id": 2500, "test3_input": "Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning. \nBUD (CONT'D) ...but I gotta plan Dad, it can work, I can save the airline, I know you got no reason to believe me but I want you to trust me...I need to talk to the unions...Can I speak for you? \nCarl's eyes. \nBUD (CONT'D) Your words, not mine... \nCARL (weakly) You speak for me, son. \nINT. AUCTION ROOM - DAY \nGekko and Darien are seated together in the back row. Darien looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement going on around her. It is the big spring Impressionist sale and all the major players, or their representatives are here. Gekko is bidding. \nGEKKO Look over there sunshine. I'm up against Richard Feigen. \nHe is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to nose confrontation. \nAUCTIONEER Once, twice, three times. Sold to Mr. Gordon Gekko. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF AUCTION HOUSE - DAY \nThey walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his triumph, grabs Darien's arm. \nGEKKO What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine. \nDARIEN (indignantly) Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago. \nGEKKO (condescendingly but paying little attention to the rebuff) Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought. \nHe pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion. \nGEKKO (CONT'D) (mockingly) So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love? \nDARIEN (indignant) It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up. \nGEKKO (off handed) Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power. \nDARIEN It's over you, Gordon. \nGEKKO (cooly) You told him about us? \nDARIEN No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?... \nShe moves closed and takes Gordon's hand. \nDARIEN (CONT'D) I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal. \nGEKKO (stroking her face) Now tell me, why would I want to do that? \nDARIEN Because I don't want to see him hurt. \nGEKKO Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. (takes her hand paternally) I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay? \nDARIEN I can't...and I won't. \nGEKKO Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit. \nDARIEN Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon. \nGEKKO You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows. \nDARIEN You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. \nGEKKO Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of. \nDarien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being banished by her father. Then... \nDARIEN I know...but maybe, just maybe Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't need you anymore. \nShe walks away. \nINT. MCGREGOR'S BAR - QUEENS - DAY \nBud is seated at a corner table with the BLUESTAR UNION REPS: Duncan Wilmore, ALPA LEADER and Toni Carpenter, AFA rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley Dent, sitting in for his father's union. \n", "test3_true": "WILMORE How do you know that the stock is going to go up? \nBUD (pointedly) You really don't want to know any more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's just say I have some friends. \nWILMORE (getting his drift) Okay. What happens then? \nBUD When the stock hits 23, you guys go to Gekko and lower the boom. Once he learns he has no union concession, he's going to head for the hills. He'll sell everything he's got. \nCARPENTER Yeah. But who's going to buy then and what's to prevent another shark from coming along and devouring us? \nINT. WILDMAN BUILDING - FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY \nBud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley, an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment lobby. \nBUD We have an appointment to see Mr. Wildman. \nINT. WILDMAN APARTMENT - DAY \nLofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE quietly moving around. Bud and the others are on sofas around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across. \nBUD Sir Lawrence, what would you say to owning Bluestar Airlines with union concessions--at $18 a share...and in the process hanging Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist.... ? \nSir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably... \nWILDMAN I might be very interested, but why? Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed up with Gekko? He doesn't know the difference between raiding and insider trading. I do. The SEC does. I hope you do... \nBUD Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have a conflict of interest. I want to see this airline work... (pointing to the documents in front of Wildman) ...the figures here show it can. \nWILDMAN (to the others) ... and you're prepared to take these large salary cuts. \nWILMORE ...we are. But we want a contract agreement -- iron-clad -- that if you buy it, you can't break it up. \nWILDMAN (hands behind his head) I'm still listening... \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer. \nMARV Well, if that's how you feel--the hell with you too. And strong letter to follow. \nHe slams the phone down. \nBUD You don't have to agree with me, Marv; but I think I've been a bit of a schmuck lately. (beat, waits) \nMARV (off the cuff) I agree. Go thou and sin no more. \nBUD I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it. \nMARV (animated, grabs the phone) Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders. \nBud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having a hard time walking. \nBUD Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all your clients in it. \nDavls looks gravely at Bud. \nMANNHEIM I don't know where you get your information, son, but I don't like it. The only reason I'm gonna do it is...I need the money, that's the problem with money--it makes you do things you don't want to do. \nBud hears him, walks on... \nMARV (into phone) Miss Bloom, Marvin. You got cancer in your portfolio, but I got the cure...Bluestar Airlines... \nINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY \nBud on the phone, checking his quotron. \nBUD Listen I need a favor and it's a quick scalp for you. Two hundred thousand at 19 1/2; can you position it in one of your equity funds? \nJANET (voicebox) ...call waiting on 7. \nBUD Hold on...

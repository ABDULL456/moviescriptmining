CANDY You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie. 
HOMER (teasing her) That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie. 
CANDY Not with the right girl you wouldn't. 
Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks afraid to breathe. 
From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears. 
INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT 
"King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; his eyes are closed. 
LARCH Fuzzy? Fuzzy? 
They are alone in the dining hall. Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy for a private viewing. 
EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - MORNING 
Buster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave. The tiny gravestone says "F.S." 
BUSTER What are you going to tell the little ones? 
LARCH I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted. 
BUSTER Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him? 
LARCH They'll believe it because they want to believe it. 
BUSTER Shouldn't we tell Homer? 
LARCH If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us. 
INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT 
The boys in their beds listen to Buster inventing Fuzzy's "family." 
BUSTER It was a family with a better breathing machine then the one Dr. Larch built. 
INT. ST. CLOUD'S - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Larch leans against the wall, covering his eyes, overhearing the boys. 
BUSTER (O.S.) The family that adopted Fuzzy, they *invented* the breathing machine. It's their business... breathing machines. 
Larch pauses; he waits to see if they believe this. 
CURLY (O.S.) Lucky Fuzzy! 
Larch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath. 
ALL THE BOYS (O.S.) Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy Stone! 
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MORNING 
As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin', Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to Homer. 
OLIVE Some mail for you, Homer. 
Homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the table, unopened. Olive turns to Rose Rose. 
OLIVE And some clothes for you, dear-- (nodding to the cider house) let's go see if they fit. 
Mr. Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider house. The other men view Homer's package with curiosity, especially Peaches. 
PEACHES Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer? 
MR. ROSE Mind your own business, Peaches. 
PEACHES Sorry, Homer... 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT 
Homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. Homer pulls the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed. 
EXT. OCEAN/BEACH - DUSK 
The beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag, Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of broken glass. 
HOMER Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet? 
CANDY Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges. 
She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high-tide mark. 
CANDY See? That's last year's glass, or from some year before. I put glass here every year. The ocean makes it beautiful. 
Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade of green. 
CANDY Give me your hand.

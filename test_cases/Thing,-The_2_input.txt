DR. COPPER (O.S.) Garry. The rest of you! Come here! 
INT. INFIRMARY 
The men rush in. Fuchs and Copper stand by the open plasma storage refrigerator. The inside is a mess of dried blood. The bladders have been ripped open. Copper is ghastly pale. 
DR. COPPER Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged it. 
NAULS Oh, my God. 
A horrified silence. 
MACREADY Was it broken into? 
FUCHS No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. And then locked it. 
Sanchez twitches, terrified. 
MACREADY Well, who's got access to it? 
DR. COPPER I guess I'm the only one. 
GARRY And I've got the only key. 
Several pairs of eyes turn to Garry. 
MACREADY Would that test have worked? 
DR. COPPER I think so. 
NORRIS Somebody else sure as hell thought so. 
MACREADY Who else could have used that key? 
GARRY Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it... 
MACREADY Could anyone have gotten it from you? 
DR. COPPER I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away. 
NORRIS When was the last time you used it? 
DR. COPPER (uneasy) A day or so ago... I guess. 
Garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him. 
GARRY I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But... 
CHILDS That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? 
GARRY (upset, flustered) Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator. 
Silence as the men continue to stare. Sanchez is perspiring. 
GARRY Copper's the only one who has any business with it. 
The eyes shift from Garry to Copper. 
DR. COPPER Now... wait a second, Garry, you've been in here on several occasions... 
FUCHS And the Doc thought of the test. 
CHILDS (anger) So what?! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! Bullshit! 
Sanchez bolts out the door. Stunned for a beat, the others chase after him. 
GARRY Hey, Sanchez! 
SANCHEZ 
in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors. 
Opening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit. 
They shout for him to stop. 
CUT TO: 
SANCHEZ 
as he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. Locked. 
He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous. 
The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his handgun and points. 
GARRY Put that down! 
SANCHEZ (trembling) No. 
GARRY I'll put this right through your head.

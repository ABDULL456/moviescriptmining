Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone looks to her. 
VIVIAN Slippery little suckers... 
Kross rises. 
KROSS If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris... (turns to David) Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke. 
He rises.  He exits. 
DAVID (to Edward and Vivian) Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job. 
Edward is silent. 
VIVIAN He seems like a nice man. 
David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time. 
EDWARD We can reach an understanding on this. 
DAVID I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. 
EDWARD Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally. 
DAVID I do.  I take it all very personally. (to Vivian) Very nice meeting you, Vivian. 
David Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in silence. 
EDWARD (a beat) And that's the way the game is played. 
VIVIAN Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement. 
Edward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve. 
VIVIAN Snails for dinner.  No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood. 
A Waiter appears at the table. 
WAITER Are we ready for the next course, sir? 
EDWARD No.  Bring a check, please. 
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him. She refills his glass from the bottle. 
EDWARD Thank you. 
He drinks.  Silence. 
VIVIAN You're upset, huh? 
EDWARD Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business. 
VIVIAN You liked the guy, though. 
EDWARD Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. 
VIVIAN (excited) We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. (realizing what she's saying and quickly recovers) Except with you.  At your price I give my all... 
Edward laughs. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) Let's not talks about this heavy stuff.  Come on, relax. 
Vivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders. 
EDWARD That... is very good. 
A moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie, unbuttons his collar. 
VIVIAN Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television. 
EDWARD Television? 
VIVIAN Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all. 
EDWARD I have work to do. 
VIVIAN Uh-uh.  No work. 
Smiling, she softly kisses his throat. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) See... what you haven't figured out yet...

HARRIGAN And you want to gamble everything this one shipment will be attacked?! 
THORNTON If they're in Agua Verde that's what - --they'll go for. 
HARRIGAN If?! Why not Juarez? 
THORNTON Because we would have heard::. (then, patiently) If they are in Agua Verde they will have seen Mapache. 
HARRIGAN 
(DISGUSTED) And.who in the hell_is Mapache? 
THORNTON A killer for Huerta who calls himself a.general.-- with enough guns he can become a power in northern Mexico - my guess is Pike will try and get them f or â¢ him. 
HARRIGAN The train will be guarded by regular troops!! 
THORNTON Not regulars --.green recruits and not. worth a damn! I'll need twenty trained men -- not recruits or this gutter trash you.'ve given me.

CHANGE 
223 CONTINUED GENTER OF AN ADOBE STEAM HUT. The structure is about twenty- five feet in diameter with a small. open oven in the center surrounded by a great deal of rocks. Light comes in through a tiny hole in the center of the ceiling which also allows smoke to escape. PIKE, ANGEL AND DUTCH are sitting on a bench against one wall. Angel has been cleaned up, but looks beaten. 225 SYKES IS IN ONE CORNER, thoroughly enjoying himself. The men are all nude and stark white against the mud.' color of the walls. As the woman exits, Dutch stands and empties a bucket of water over' himself -and the others. They all gasp with relief. All have towels around their waists and none are completely sober. Pike's leg is heavily scarred and he is in pain. He stands and drinks, gets closer to the fire9 massaging his leg. 
DUTCH I don't see how you stand it 
PIKE Some day I'm going to build me one of these and live in it. (then to Angel) I don't know why I â¢ didn' t just let him kill you. 
ANGEL 
( IRATE) I'm not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again. 
DUTCH Very 'noble . 
SYRE S I didn't see no tears runnin' down your face when you rode in from San Rafael. 
ANGEL 
(ANGRY) They were not my people -- nor yours -- I care about my people, my villag.e, Mexico.

SYKES Listen, bog, you ride the trail with us your village don't count -- if it does- -you jest don't go along. 
ANGEL Then I don't go along!

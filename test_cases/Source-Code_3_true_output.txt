(ANSWERS) Hi. Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens. Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at 
HIS WATCH -- 
50 SECONDS. It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom -- 
INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING 
Tears open the door. Jumps up on the sink. 
THE BOMB Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb, he hears -- 
CHRISTINA (O.S.) Colter...? Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives -- 
CHRISTINA (O.S.) Colter, I have to tell you something. -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone. Ducking back down, he see Christina standing in the doorway. 
COLTER Look. Now the fucking thing can't go off. 
HIS WATCH Reads 20 SECONDS. 
CHRISTINA Stephanie did a computer search. Something in her expression worries him. 
CHRISTINA She's got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever. 
COLTER Source Code's classified. It wouldn't be in a newspaper. 
CHRISTINA No. But you were. She found you. 
COLTER She found me? What does that mean? She stops. Not wanting to go on. From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight train. 
COLTER Jesus Christ, Christina, are you going to spit it out? In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there, Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain: 
CHRISTINA According to the notice, you were killed in action two months ago. The world stops. A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and doubles over. She runs to him -- 
COLTER'S POV 
Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand POINTS on an array. Christina's cries become bursts of static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE - - the Source Code architecture laid bare. And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a frightening series of HALLUCINATORY FRAGMENTS: 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
A PILOT'S P.O.V. -- desert sand, searingly bright -- flight deck instrumentation -- a windshield pockmarked with bullet holes -- the horizon tilting as the helicopter PLUNGES towards earth amid a chaos of RADIO TRANSMISSIONS: "...taking a lot of RPG fire... be advised A61 is going down... A61 is going down hard..."¬ù 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne, P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher. 
INT. MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - DAY 
Airborne again. The thud of rotors. Through blurred vision we see medics working furiously to save a life. 
INT. C5 TRANSPORT JET - DAY 
The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular pulsations of a VENTILATOR. Fluids drip down through an IV bag. Tubes and monitors stacked all around us. Gurneys of other wounded packed together. The grumble of another, unseen wounded soldier: 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Never any damn leg room on a plane. An ALARM begins beeping. 
FLIGHT MEDIC (O.S.) Hey, this guy's crashing... 
FADE TO BLACK. Silence and darkness. Nothingness. 
Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide projector. The Jack of Clubs.

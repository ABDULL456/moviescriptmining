LOUIS No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight? 
Yvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty. 
YVETTE We worry about you master. When do you ride about the fields? How long since you've been to the slave quarters? Everywhere there is death. Animals, men. Are you our master still at all? 
Louis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous. 
LOUIS (dazed) Leave me alone now, Yvette. 
YVETTE I will not go unless you listen to me. Send away this new friend of yours. The slaves are frightened of him. They are frightened of you. 
She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart. She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. 
LOUIS I am frightened of myself, Yvette. 
He kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply, withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams. 
Louis stands. 
LOUIS Hush, Yvette - 
She screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor. 
In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it, revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken. 
The drumming grows louder. 
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT 
Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins. The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of Yvette. He is deranged with grief. 
LOUIS This place is cursed. Damned, do you hear me? And your master is the devil. 
He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the veranda. 
LOUIS Get out while you can. You're free men. 
They don't move. They stare at him blankly. 
LOUIS Unlike me, you are no free men... 
He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open. 
LOUIS Do I have to convince you? 
He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window, lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything. 
SLAVES POV - MASTER 
Setting fire to the house. 
They rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S MAD". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior, blocking their way. 
INT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT 
Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We can see this in his face, the texture of his skin. 
Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can see the morning sky. 
LESTAT You fool, what have you done? 
LOUIS What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire! 
Louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the floor. Lestat darts forward and catches him before he drops. He runs out the shattered window, carrying him on his shoulder. 
EXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD - DAWN 
With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over Lestat's shoulder. 
INT. CRYPT 
Darkness. Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt. He slowly comes to. 
LOUIS Where are we? 
LESTAT Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough? 
Louis laughs softly. 
LOUIS We belong in hell. 
LESTAT And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that? 
INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

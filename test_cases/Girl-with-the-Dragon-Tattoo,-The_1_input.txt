ARMANSKY In every way. 13   INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY          13 
The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away. 
14   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              14 SECRETARY/INTERCOM Ms. Salander's here. 
Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.' 
Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots. 
Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me. 
ARMANSKY Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. FRODE How do you do? 
She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him: 
SALANDER Something wrong with the report? FRODE No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it. 
SALANDER There's nothing not in it. 
FRODE Your opinion of him isn't. 
SALANDER I'm not paid to give my opinion. 
FRODE So you don't have one? 
Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually - SALANDER He's clean.   In my opinion. 
FRODE He's - excuse me?

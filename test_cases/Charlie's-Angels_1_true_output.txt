PASQUAL Well, what're you gonna do? 
JAMES EARL JONES Walk out. 
PASQUAL That's very funny. 
But James Earl Jones is dead serious. 
JAMES EARL JONES No.   It isn't. 
Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the back of the plane, shouting: 
JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D) EVERYONE!   FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS! 
Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight, he yanks open the emergency door release. 
With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses. 
Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in screams out of the open door, including -- 
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY 
-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug. They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely. 
DROPPING WITH THEM 
They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact, casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks -- 
FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY 
At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the distance... 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4. 
CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK 
It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards 
JONES AND PASQUAL 
who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS and tries to clutch onto him, desperate. 
JAMES EARL JONES (over the rushing wind) PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE COMPANY. PASQUAL WHAT? 
Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles, stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him. 
All three are still free-falling. 
James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman. 
Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels. She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale -- only she's playing for the good guys. 
She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He flies upward, leaving -- 
Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the ocean screams up at them. Not much time left. 
James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig. 
Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute unfurls, and now... 
Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards -- 
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY 
A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling V-8. 
Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel. At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 5. 
CONTINUED: 
But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's unstoppable. 
Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake. 
Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his dashiki-chute, and then all three look up... 
Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around, catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones. 
PASQUAL You crazy bastard! 
JAMES EARL JONES I think you mean crazy bitch. 
With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is... 
... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number three. She's the wild one. 
Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then reaches in her mouth -- 
DYLAN (still with James Earl Jones' voice) Don't need this anymore. 
-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) (now in her real voice) But I sure could use this.

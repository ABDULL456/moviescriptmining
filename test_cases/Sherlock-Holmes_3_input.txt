-- but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95 
Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling. 
He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone, hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house. 
Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock). 
Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. 
In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. 
He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle. 
He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle. (CONTINUED)

Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that. 
BLACKWOOD (O.S.) And now it dawns on you, you begin to recognize your part in his play. 
Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him within the outer circle of flame. 
BLACKWOOD You see the path he chose for you. 
Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

95   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 95 BLACKWOOD Didn't you wonder why it was so easy to catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would I take a sixth under St. Paul's? 
Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight. 
BLACKWOOD Unless I simply wanted to be caught by the great Sherlock Holmes... 
Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at Holmes' head. 
BLACKWOOD ... so I could die on the biggest stage of all. You made me what I am. 
We see -- 
HOLMES' POV 
as Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes' head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react -- 
WHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME --

We see a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS, has Blackwood killed Holmes, or is he hallucinating, caught in the spell he conjured?

Writing and sweating on the bed in the attic. Holmes sees a hazy image of Irene. She leans over him smiling sweetly then wraps her hands around his neck and starts to strangle him. 
IRENE SAYING "WHERE'S WATSON WHEN YOU NEED HIM?" 
BLACKWOOD IN THE ROOM AGAIN WITHIN THE FLAME CIRCLE.

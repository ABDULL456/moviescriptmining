OLIVE Am I in trouble? I promise the hem of my dress isn't higher than my fingertips. 
MRS. GRIFFIN You're not in trouble, Olive. I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me. 
OLIVE If I open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence? 
MRS. GRIFFIN Yes. 
OLIVE (CONFESSIONAL) I watch `American Idol.' Do NOT tell anyone. 
Mrs. Griffin rolls her eyes. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I have a reputation to uphold. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Don't you, though? 
Olive assesses this statement from her. 
OLIVE We done? If I can think of any angsty things to report, you'll be the first to know. 
She winks at her. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) This has been so much fun that I'm actually - at this very moment - considering meth addiction, just so I can come back and we can jaw some more. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (BITINGLY) Or you could always get pregnant? 
OLIVE I'm probably closer than either of us thinks... 
Mrs. Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of CONDOMS. Feigning excitement -- 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Propho-tastic!

OLIVE Puritanical and oppressive? 
MRS. GRIFFIN Conservative. 
Olive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned. 
OLIVE I don't need those. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (STERNLY) But you do. 
Olive starts to confess, but then just takes the rubbers and puts them in her own purse. 
OLIVE Thank you. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Remember: our little secret. And, hey, would you send in the next person? 
Mrs. Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves. 
INT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Marianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed. He rubs his eyes, like he's been crying. Olive is surprised to see him there. 
OLIVE You're up, hoss. 
MARIANNE (Concerned; To Micah) It's going to be okay. 
She gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her office. 
OLIVE (TO MARIANNE) Let me guess: drugs. 
Marianne gives her a `go away' look. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I didn't know Christians believed in guidance counsellors. (Beat.) Ooo! Ooo! Is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality? 
Marianne begins crying. 
MARIANNE No, you insensitive rhymes-with- witch! His parents are going THROUGH A (MORE) 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) (WHISPERED) divorce!

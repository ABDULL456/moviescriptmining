INT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY 
Mean Dude #5 enters the lobby where an OLD CLERK is sitting at the counter reading a yellowed newspaper. There is a pit bull on the floor beside him. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Da me telefono. 
VIEJO CLERK (without looking) Take it. 
Mean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Pit bull? 
VIEJO CLERK Yeah, pit bull. 
The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly crosses their names out. 
MEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Dead? 
The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also glances up. 
MEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) All of them? How long ago? OK, What does this guy look like? 
Clerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still paying attention, though.

Most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her.. \nELIZABETH We've managed to look at one or two, yes. \nTONY In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary? \nELIZABETH (cont'd) No. I believe a few over-eager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers..and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune. \nTONY Under normal circumstances I would agree, but..P RINCE PHILIP (under his breath) Here we go! The bloody flag again..! \nELIZABETH indicates for PHILIP to be quiet.. \nTONY ..my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets - and the information I'm getting is that the mood..

E ELIZABETH I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. a beat) That's the way we do things in this country.

GHILLIES OFFICE - DAY \nThe HEAD GHILLIE listens, his expression changes in alarm, then.. \nHEAD GHILLIE Are you sure, Ma'am? \nELIZABETH Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive. You forget I worked as a mechanic in the war. \nHEAD GHILLIE And are you all right? \nINT.

Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying. W e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes. Gradually, she composes herself. \nThat's better. \non't want to make a fuss. \nhe GILLIES will be here soon. \nThe QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better. \nresently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable sense that she is being watched. Strange.. \nThe QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup.. \nStanding in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the STAG. \nThe QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have imagined. \nTONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy. \nTONY (CONT'D) Ma'am, a poll that's to be published in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy and one in four are now in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether. \nilence. \nTONY As your Prime Minister, I believe it's my constitutional responsibility to ADVISE the following.. \nTONY braces himself.

Then.. \nELIZABETH Something's happened. There's been a change...a shift of values.. \nThe QUEEN looks up.. \nELIZABETH (cont'd) When you no longer understand your people, isn't it time to hand over to the next generation? \nQUEEN MOTHER Certainly not! Remember the oath you took \nELIZABETH \"I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.\" \nQUEEN MOTHER Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment to God as well as your people. \nELIZABETH But if my actions are damaging the crown? \nQUEEN MOTHER Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER had. The problem will come when you leave, but that's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today. \nTONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers, and half watching television at the same time. \nON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call.

Thrown by his compliment.. \nTONY And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days. \nELIZABETH Really? \nELIZABETH You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for.. \nShe wants to say `Me', but instead says.. \nELIZABETH ..this institution has been diminished? \nTONY Not at all. \npause.. \nELIZABETH I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support.. \nTONY One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. a beat) I could never have added my voice to the chorus. \nELIZABETH You're very kind. \nThe QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow.. \nELIZABETH But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason. \nTONY Which is? \nELIZABETH That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has. \nTONY looks up.. \nELIZABETH If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. (a beat) Just look at the French. \nThe QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses..            E ELIZABETH (cont'd) I suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand.. \n", "test3_true": "ELIZABETH (cont'd) I do love this time of day. Shall we walk while there's still some sunshine left? I do hope you're a walker. \nTONY I am. \nELIZABETH Good. The clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five. \nTONY and the QUEEN get to their feet. \nELIZABETH (cont'd) I always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the Prime Minister is a walker. \nFOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the Audience Room, and into.. \nINT. CORRIDOR - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY \nBLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a corridor from the audience room... \nELIZABETH As a matter of fact, it's how I think best. On my feet. I've never been one for sitting around endlessly. A good walk and fresh air sorts everything out.. \nUnexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been holding something back.. \nELIZABETH One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid of me? T \nTONY For about half an hour. But then you came down to London and all that went away. \nELIZABETH I've never been hated like that before. \nTONY No. And that must have been difficult. \nELIZABETH It was. Very. \nThey begin walking again.. \nELIZABETH Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that's what people wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first... self second. \nThe QUEEN stops.. \nELIZABETH It's how I was brought up. It's all I've ever known \nTONY One forgets. You were so young when you became Queen. \nThe QUEEN drifts off.. \nELIZABETH I was. A girl. \nThen pulls herself back.. \nELIZABETH But I can see the world has changed. And one must 'modernise'. \nTONY Well, perhaps that's where I can help. \nELIZABETH (with a twinkle as they set off) Don't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister, I think you'll find that I'm supposed to be advising YOU! \nINT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND STAIRCASE - DAY \nThe corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow. The QUEEN smiles.. \nINT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY \nFOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens. The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out.. \nELIZABETH So...what might we expect in your first Parliament? \nTONY clears his throat, then.. \nTONY Well, Ma'am, top of the list is education reform. We want to radically reduce classroom sizes... \nOur CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance... \nTime has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints. \nThe momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long forgotten.. \nFADE TO BLACK: \n", "test3_id": 3188}

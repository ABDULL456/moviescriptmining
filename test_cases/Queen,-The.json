Even the \"Mail\".. (disdainfully holding the paper between finger and thumb) ..was impressed. \nALASTAIR drops the papers on TONY's desk. \nJANVRIN Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. a beat) For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the coffin. \nELIZABETH I see.. \nThe QUEEN MOTHER's eyes widen.. \nJANVRIN And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other..

Remember the oath you took \nELIZABETH \"I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.\" \nQUEEN MOTHER Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment to God as well as your people. \nELIZABETH But if my actions are damaging the crown? \nQUEEN MOTHER Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has.

CAR - SAME TIME - ARCHIVE / RECONSTITUTED ARCHIVE \nThe QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the CROWDS.. \nPRINCE PHILIP (jaw drops) Good God.. \nThe QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep. \nhe FACES are reflected in the car windows. Are they hostile? Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop. \nNT. DOWNING STREET - ALASTAIR'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on the text as he writes, inserting... \n\"..speaking as a Grandmother\".. \nIn the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up.

DOWNING STREET - SAME TIME \nTONY and CHERIE BLAIR watch from their apartment.. \nELIZABETH (ON TV) We have all felt these emotions in these last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart... \nTONY flinches in sympathy as she says the line. CHERIE notices this, then.. \nCHERIE \"Heart\"? What \"heart\". She doesn't mean a word of this. \nTONY That's not the point. What she's doing is extraordinary. (points to the TV) That's how you survive. \nCHERIE turns, and stares.. \nCHERIE Listen to you! A week ago you were the great moderniser, making speeches about the \"People's Princess\", now you've gone weak at the knees. \nTONY bristles with irritation.. \nCHERIE I don't know why I'm surprised. In the end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga- ga for her Maj. \nELIZABETH (ON TV) I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life. \nINT.

Then.. \nDIRECTOR (calls out) And we're out..! \nThe QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A huge, collective breathing out. D IRECTOR (cont'd) Thank you, your Majesty. \nBut the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip- mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR.. \n..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one another.. \nOVER THIS: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting, elegiac hymn.. \nINT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY \nTONY (cont'd) And the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi, who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on Nigeria. \nSilence. \nTONY I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather. \nilence. \nTONY I imagine those occasions are quite difficult. Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private audience.. \nSilence. TONY takes a deep breath, then.. \nTONY Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies.. \nThe QUEEN looks up.. \nELIZABETH Whatever for? \nTONY In case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way. \nELIZABETH Not at all. \nbeat. \nELIZABETH I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer. \nTONY The circumstances were exceptional, Ma'am. And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility.   E ELIZABETH ou're confusing humility with humiliation. \nTONY That's not true. \nELIZABETH You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday. \nTONY I still believe History will show it was a good week for you. \nELIZABETH And an even better one for you, Mr Blair. \nTONY But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century. \nThe QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment.. \nTONY And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days. \nELIZABETH Really? \nELIZABETH You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for.. \nShe wants to say `Me', but instead says.. \nELIZABETH ..this institution has been diminished? \nTONY Not at all. \npause.. \nELIZABETH I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support.. \nTONY One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. a beat) I could never have added my voice to the chorus. \nELIZABETH You're very kind. \nThe QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow.. \nELIZABETH But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason. \nTONY Which is? \nELIZABETH That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has. \nTONY looks up.. \nELIZABETH If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. (a beat) Just look at the French. \nThe QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses..

And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?\" \nELIZABETH Hmm. \nThe QUEEN watches as he paints.. \nELIZABETH I rather envy you being able to vote.

He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met.

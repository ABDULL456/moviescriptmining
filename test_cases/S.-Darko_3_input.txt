A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air. Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful ball after ball, aiming in different directions. 
SAM They're pretty. 
After his stick fizzles out: 
JEREMY You wanna try one? 
Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she accepts it with her RIGHT HAND... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Just hold it straight up. 
Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK catches... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) It's goin'! 
Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as possible. She closes her eyes... 
But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to catch fire. 
SAM Ow! 
JEREMY Drop it! 
He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Fucking faulty one... 
Sam nurses her burned hand. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Are you okay? 
SAM I think so... 
Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER. 
JEREMY You need to get that covered... 
Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and starts to tear off a piece. 
SAM What are you doing? 
JEREMY It's okay... 
EXT. BANK - NIGHT 
The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4, 1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00 MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS... 
EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT 
Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. 
JEREMY How's it feel? 
SAM A little better... 
The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent. 
After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy... 
The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the greater part of it. 
SAM (CONT'D) Good God... 
Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up his jacket and puts it back on. 
SAM (CONT'D) (ALARMED) Is that from the meteorite? 
JEREMY I barely even notice it anymore. I'm sure it'll go away soon. 
He zips up his jacket tight. 
SAM Are you fucking kidding me? 
JEREMY Do you think I'm disgusting? 
The question takes Sam by surprise. 
SAM No... I just think you should get it looked at- 
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss... 
Sam shoves him away sharply. 
SAM (CONT'D) What the hell are you doing?

{"train": "Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. BAR - LATER \nArthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd! (IN A CONGA?) He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG ROCKET. \nARTHUR Stand back! \nHe releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle, people screaming and diving for cover. It explodes into a shop sign reading `CHECKS CASHED'. \nCARMELLA (LAUGHING) Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the recession? \nARTHUR The what? \nEXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT \nA very long line of excited people stand at an ATM, Arthur at the front. \nARTHUR Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix this thing right now. (to his first customer) How much, sir? \nFIRST MAN Um. $800 please. \nARTHUR Coming right up. (keys it in) Fries with that? \nThe man laughs, along with others in the line, including Sofia who catches his eye. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Congratulations everyone! THE RECESSION'S OVER! \nArthur dials a number on his gold iPhone. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can you squeeze me in for a little snack? Yeah, just me and a couple of mates. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nThe Maitre D' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's standing room only. People are even sitting on tables. It's a very eclectic mix of people. \nAn angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit horrified at the center. \nArthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from the ATM line. \nARTHUR Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please. \nThe daughter of the stuffy couple - she's ERICA - speaks. \nERICA Arthur? \nARTHUR (TAKEN ABACK) Erica? Fancy meeting you here! Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the very best friend forever of my girlfriend Susan. And Erica's parents Ernest and Margaret. (to Erica and her parents) Are you familiar with the expression `I can't explain anything'? \nERICA Who are the women with you, Arthur? \nARTHUR Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe she works for Avis. Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing. And this is Carmella. Anyway... \nERICA'S FATHER What do you do, Carmella? \nCARMELLA Whatever you want. But no penetration without a rubber. \nIt's all gone a bit tense. \nARTHUR Carmella's joking. She's actually a...queen. Of a very small country. \nERICA'S FATHER Is she now? \nARTHUR It's terribly small. \nERICA'S FATHER I see. \nARTHUR Rhode Island could beat the crap out of it in a war. \nERICA'S FATHER Yes, it's a small place. \nARTHUR 85 cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other. I'm talking small. \nERICA'S FATHER I think I understand how small it is. \nARTHUR Just had the entire country carpeted, this is not a big place. \nERICA'S FATHER You need to grow up, Arthur. \nARTHUR That's easy for you to say, you haven't got 50 pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet. Maybe we should go somewhere else. \nSOFIA Is she going to stay here? \nARTHUR Hobson, could you come back in a minute and a half please? \nHOBSON Negative. You're seeing your mother this morning. \nARTHUR Nobody told me. \nHOBSON Actually I did, on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as `last night'. \nHobson picks up Sofia's panties and bra from the floor like a crime scene officer. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear. Addictive personality. He was at mine until he was six. \nARTHUR Hobson! Really... \nHOBSON I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off... \nSOFIA I can't do this. \nShe pulls away from Arthur, grabs her clothes and jumps out of bed, nearly tipping Arthur out. \nHOBSON I support your decision 100%. Will you be requiring a taxi, or just be getting in a random passing car? \nSofia storms to the door, clutching her clothes. Arthur can see other revellers being removed by HOTEL SECURITY. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) Say goodbye to your new friends, Arthur. They have to go back to the recession now. \nArthur covers his head with the sheet. \nARTHUR Cancel my mother please, Hobson. I'll work from bed today. \nBut Hobson hits a touch-sensitive screen on the wall. The magnetic bed thuds to the ground. She taps another control. \nMUSIC: HORRIBLE, DEAFENING DEATH METAL \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Not the death metal, please! \nHOBSON (shouting over the music) Aren't you a fan of Carcass? \nHobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre. \nARTHUR OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP! \nArthur sits up. Hobson stops the music. \nHOBSON Good boy. \nARTHUR I'm going for a shower. \nHOBSON I'll alert the media. \nEXT. BALCONY SHOWER - DAY \nArthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine stunt. Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's ceiling. Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet as he showers. \nARTHUR (SINGING) To Bombay, a travelling circus came... \nArthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook. \nHOBSON They brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name...Hobson! \nWe see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall. She's on a phone at Arthur's computer. \nARTHUR Female Tom Hanks! \nINT. SITTING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nHobson - in front of an Ebay screen full of purchases - picks up her own pair of binoculars and looks down. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Heading east towards Park Avenue. \nThrough Hobson's binoculars we see A MIDDLE-AGED BUSINESSWOMAN who does look vaguely like a female Tom Hanks! \nHOBSON She's early today... \nARTHUR Can we invite her up and dress her as Forrest Gump? \nHOBSON No. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) That was a joke, folks. It was built for the Chrysler corporation. \nNaomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly in love with her. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) The spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to... \nGRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST (INTERRUPTING) How tall is it? \nNAOMI 1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross. \nNaomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear. Arthur hurries alongside Naomi. \nARTHUR Can I join your tour please? \nNAOMI Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel. Sorry, my bosses make the prices. \nArthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Sorry. I can't take cards. (BEAT) Ah, owe me it. I start on that corner every day on the hour... \nJust as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving very aggressively, nearly hits her. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't your braille windshield work? \nCABBIE (ANGRY) !NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS! \nNAOMI PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN MARTILLO! \nThe cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She smiles back. \nARTHUR Wow. What did you say? \nNAOMI Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals. (to the tourists) Everyone make it over alive? Excellent. Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise. (TO ARTHUR) Sir? What shape is Times Square? \nARTHUR A circle? \nNAOMI (LAUGHS) See? Morons. \nMore tourists laugh this time. Some... \nGRUMPY MALE TOURIST When do we get the pretzel? \nNAOMI Soon, sir. Soon. \nShe checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Okay, next the very Laundromat once used by George Gershwin, Donald Trump... \nINT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nNaomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle and makes a loud buzz. \nNAOMI ...Mr Big from Sex and the City and three of the 9-11 terrorists. \nShe starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites - vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Oh, dad. \nShe transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it quarters. Arthur stays close. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the Chelsea Hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer. \nARTHUR (CONSPIRATORIAL) Are you abusing this tour to do your errands? \nNAOMI Are you abusing the tour to stalk me? \nARTHUR Absolutely. \nArthur stares at the big tumble dryers. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) These things are amazing. Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one? \nNaomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the door. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY \nHobson's out of the car looking for Arthur. \nHOBSON Where the blazes is that boy? Arthur! \nEXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nINT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThey cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading `TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS INC' to the elevator. \nARTHUR But what if this is the one? \nHOBSON This is just like the Komodo dragon. Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there. You had to own one. Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away. \nARTHUR (HORRIFIED) You said he's in London Zoo! \nHOBSON He is, Arthur. Are you the only one allowed to joke now? \nINT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS. RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nReception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread. Arthur and Hobson enter. \nARTHUR I don't like it here. \nHOBSON Of course you don't. People work here. \nGRANT (HATES ARTHUR) Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead. \nARTHUR Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch? \nGRANT (doesn't get the joke) I have no connection with that store. My family name is Von Krausehoff. Take a seat please. \nArthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone. \nGRANT (CONT'D) Vivienne? (conspiratorial, flirty) White mid-rise briefs...mmmm. \nHOBSON Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take long. Then we'll have ice cream. \nA LARGE OFFICE DOOR opens spookily of its own accord. \nVIVIENNE (O.S.) Come in, Arthur. \nArthur heads to the door. VIVIENNE BACH-TEMPLEMEAD a formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his hand. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) Arthur. \nARTHUR Vivienne. \nVIVIENNE You know I prefer `mother'. \nARTHUR I'm sorry. You look more like a Vivienne. \nVivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts. An icy breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate. \nINT. VIVIENNE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft. There's one small photo of Vivienne, Arthur's late father GERALD and Arthur as a toddler. \nVivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. Arthur, clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her. \nVIVIENNE (not looking up) So. How are you, Arthur? \nARTHUR Quite busy. I have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage... \nBut Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What else...I'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment. She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic... \nVivienne's still not listening. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street... \nShe's still not listening. Has it always been like this? \nARTHUR (CONT'D) ...which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange... \nShe's still not listening. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) ..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism. \nStill not listening. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What else? Um...tripped over in the shower this morning. Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together. \nStill not listening. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm thinking of buying a giant. I think the market's right for it. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom of the London phone box aquarium. Arthur eats lunch alone at a huge table, THE BIGGEST DIAMOND RING IN THE WORLD is beside him. Hobson brings a plate of vitamins. \nHOBSON Ah. The ring your father gave your mother, I recall. \nARTHUR (feeling its huge weight) Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley? \nHOBSON No. Your father was a gentleman. \nARTHUR What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him? That's just rude. Did he ever love my mother? \nHOBSON They had their days. \nARTHUR Ah well. At least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle. \nArthur stares at the ring again. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What about Naomi? \nHOBSON Arthur. I say this with love: \nARTHUR Uh-oh... \nHOBSON Even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit. Coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly. Susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the Flatiron Building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you. \nARTHUR I have you for that. \nHOBSON Not forever. \nARTHUR Yes forever. You're Hobson. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nNaomi answers a giant old cellphone in her modest apartment, cooking for her dad, RALPH, a bear of a man slumped in front of the TV watching CSI. A picture of Naomi and her elderly mother, in hospital, is on the wall. \nNAOMI Hello? (SILENCE) Hello? \nARTHUR (O.S, ON PHONE) (MOCK SINISTER) This is your English stalker. \nNAOMI (UNFAZED) Oh, hi! What's up? \nARTHUR I'm sorry, I've never really understood that question. Are you free tomorrow night? \nNAOMI Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nArthur's on the toilet in a bathroom whose walls are entirely covered in a photographic mural to make it look like he's sitting at the top of a ski slope, with skis on his feet. \nARTHUR Is that a euphemism for something naughty? \nNAOMI No, it's a lie. I have a creative writing class. Tonight? \nArthur glances down at the ring box on the floor. \nARTHUR I have a contractual commitment. Friday? \nNAOMI You got it. \nARTHUR Paper. \nNAOMI Sorry? \nA voice-activated toilet paper dispenser spits out a sheet. \nARTHUR Sorry, I was talking to something else. So. What do you want to do? \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS \nNaomi dishes out the food on cheap plates. It's all a big contrast to Arthur's setting. \nNAOMI A movie? \nARTHUR Movie? Come on, you've got to try harder than that. \nNAOMI Pizza. \nARTHUR What have you always wanted to do? \nNAOMI It's a first date, Arthur. Not our honeymoon. \nARTHUR You don't, um, have anything stronger, do you? \nBURT Sparkling. \nArthur laughs nervously. But Burt's not joking. \nBURT (CONT'D) `The drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty: and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags.' \nARTHUR Surely a glass of sherry at Christmas? \nBurt clinks glasses with him. \nBURT Peace be with you. \nARTHUR And also with me. \nHe sees Jesus's head! It's sitting on top of one of the blades of the ceiling fan! \nBURT Arthur. Can I be honest with you? \nARTHUR You're the real Slim Shady? I knew it! \nBURT My faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner. But with you, I struggle with that belief. \nBurt turns away to get a glass of water. \nARTHUR You could switch to Judaism. (glances up at the fan) Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I put the fan on? \nArthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again, until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off. Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight temporarily. \nBURT Anyway, Arthur. However I feel about you, my daughter loves you. \nARTHUR Yes, it's a problem, isn't it? \nArthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on the sex offenders register....No, I am and she knows. (BEAT) Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay! I did once dabble actually, so I can tell a plausible story. \nBURT You made love to a guy? \nARTHUR One Moslem doesn't make a mosque, Burt. \nBURT You made love to a Moslem? \nARTHUR No, sir, it was Prince Alois of Lichtenstein and he made love to me. The fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi full of Krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality. \nArthur notices that Jesus's head is on backwards. \nBurt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory. \nBURT `If there is a man who lies with a male, they shall surely be put to death.' \nARTHUR Crikey. Couldn't there just be some kind of on-the-spot fine? \nBurt really hammers the table this time. \nBURT You will stop this talk and marry - my - fucking... \nJesus's head falls off. Arthur peers around. It's nowhere! \nARTHUR Oh bollocks. \nBoth Arthur and Burt see Jesus's head at the bottom of the fish tank. It floats back up to the top. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) It's a miracle! He is risen! \nBut SUSAN, Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hi Susan. Erica. \nBurt looks from Jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out. \nSUSAN Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I was talking to your mother. I hear you have something to ask me! \nArthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him. \nARTHUR Shall we go? \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA VERY PRECISE FRENCH WAITER performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan. Susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously. \nAt table level, Susan waits, irritated. \nARTHUR (O.S.) All done. \nSusan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Susan. Would you marry me? Take the weekend if you want... \nSUSAN Yes, I'll marry you. \nShe nods imperceptibly at the waiter. \nWAITER Ladies and gentleman - the happy couple! \nMusic starts. A congratulatory round of applause. Confetti is thrown. The whole restaurant cheers. Susan whips out her Blackberry and starts hitting keys. \nSUSAN Erica will be the planner. \nARTHUR Erica? She hates me. \nSUSAN Who I love, she loves. \nARTHUR Oh, come on. She always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an Uzi. \nSusan's phone rings. \nSUSAN (ANSWERING) Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang on, I have Erica calling... \nARTHUR What's going on? I only just bloody proposed! \nArthur's phone rings. The caller I.D reads `Vivienne'. He kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate. \nINT. PIERRE HOTEL BASEMENT GARAGE - NIGHT - LATER \nIn the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in KITT from `Knight Rider'. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What have I done, Kitt? This mistake's up there with Hitler joining his school debating team... \nVOICE (FEMALE) Go to bed, Arthur. \nArthur jumps out of his skin. But it's Hobson, standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa. \nHOBSON And stop this self-pitying bibble. You're going to be fabulously rich. \nARTHUR Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor. Some poor people I see look happy. \nHOBSON That's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. Arthur, poor people have to work. They stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs. \nARTHUR Don't patronise me. I have a job. \nHOBSON Lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work I mean. And I don't want to see you suffer. Take your fish oil. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT, QUEENS - NIGHT \nA very old Apple Mac sits on a cluttered desk. \nRalph is in his chair, eating Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits, watching CSI on an old TV with a tiny satellite dish on top. \nRALPH When are we getting cable? \nNAOMI (O.S.) We have satellite. \nRALPH Honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent Store! \nNAOMI It's a satellite dish! \nRALPH I read the box! It said `No satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals!' That's like saying `Hey - eat this plate of broken glass! It won't make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!' \nNaomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. She checks her hair in the mirror. \nNAOMI It's better than nothing. \nRalph unplugs the dish. The picture improves. \nRALPH No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom. And she bought food from yard sales. \nNAOMI I miss her too, daddy. But now she's gone and if I'm going to keep you in grits and Oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules. \nRALPH But you live like you're preparing for a war. And you earn a decent salary. \nNAOMI So? I want to know I can look after you. \nERICA Don't worry, Thomas. This whole thing's just a joke to Arthur. \nHobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen. \nARTHUR (VERY AFFECTIONATE) Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to me. \nVivienne, irritated, hands Hobson a coffee cup. \nVIVIENNE Take this away. (TO ERICA) Progress on the reception? \nERICA Black inked at the Emery Roth Room at the Ritz-Carlton. \nThe screen lights up with a church graphic. \nERICA (CONT'D) A first pass at the guest list. Bride's family and friends: \nA 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop. In the mock up, the bride's side of the aisle fills with hundreds of computerised guests, many labelled with famous names. \nERICA (CONT'D) Groom's family and friends: \nAbout a fifth of that number pop up on Arthur's side. \nERICA (CONT'D) We can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests, Arthur. To make it seem less desperate. \nArthur groans and leans over a bowl. \nARTHUR Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7.6 on the Richter..the Sickter... \nArthur's sick. Erica lays out more sheets. \nERICA Cakes, caterers, floral arrangements, photographer... \nHobson reappears, wipes his mouth and takes the bowl. She stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to Vivienne's nose. \nHOBSON Will there be anything else, sir? \nARTHUR No, thanks. \nHOBSON (TO VIVIENNE) Ma'am? \nVIVIENNE No. You can leave. \nARTHUR Why all this crap now? What's the rush anyway? \nBURT The wedding is in a month, Arthur. \nARTHUR A month? I was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years. Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day. \nArthur gets up. \nERICA Where are you going? \nARTHUR (gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait. \nEXT. MANHATTAN - DAY \nArthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in daylight. He stops. \nARTHUR Here we are. \nNAOMI We're not going to end up in the Hudson again, are we? \nARTHUR I can promise you won't get wet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT \nThe Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists. \nEXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT \nArthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street. He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose. \nNAOMI Are you okay? \nARTHUR Yeah, fine. Actually... \nBut Naomi sees something on the other side of the road. \nArthur gets a a text from Hobson: `TELL her!' \nARTHUR I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning to ride you around the course next. Her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch. Had to be destroyed on the spot. \nVivienne canters her horse up to them. \nVIVIENNE Arthur. What's so urgent that you had to come all the way out here? \nARTHUR I'm in love. With a woman who isn't exactly who you'd describe as Susan. She's called Naomi. \nVIVIENNE Arthur, we've been through this! \nARTHUR Won't you at least meet her? \nVIVIENNE What family is she from? \nARTHUR The Snarts of Detroit. \nVIVIENNE Never heard of them. \nARTHUR No, because they're normal. She's a walking tour guide, her dad's a retired car worker. \nVIVIENNE Susan will generate quality sons, not oil-soaked car monkeys. \nARTHUR Unbelievable! Why don't you just keep me here, pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day... \nVIVIENNE Arthur... \nARTHUR ...then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first? \nVIVIENNE We need an heir! \nARTHUR Fine! You can have one with Stevey Steroids here! Surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now. \nArthur storms away towards the car. \nGRANT (STEPPING IN) That's enough, Arthur... \nARTHUR None of your business, J Crew. \nGRANT You are so ungrateful to your mother. She adores you! \nVIVIENNE Arthur. Come back here. \nARTHUR You can shove your inheritance up your horse's arse! \nArthur jumps into the car and it pulls away. Vivienne sits shocked on her horse. But then she throws it into a gallop and catches up. \nVIVIENNE Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your heart. But do be aware I consider what you've squandered so far an advance on your inheritance. That's about $17 million. \nARTHUR Why would you do that? You'd never get it back. \nVIVIENNE No. But you'd spend the rest of your life in court. There's a simple solution to all this. Marry Susan. And cheat with the nobody from Queens. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nArthur's very drunk, maudlin, sitting opposite Naomi. He's holding his menu upside down. \nNAOMI Have you been at the cookies? \nARTHUR I ate the whole jar. \nNAOMI (realising it's serious) Oh, man. What? What? \nARTHUR I'm engaged. To another Susan. Woman. Engaged to another woman. \nShe slams her menu down. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. \nNAOMI What are you talking about? This is bullshit. Who do you think you are? Is this some rich guy thing? \nARTHUR I was going to tell you! I just... \nNaomi gets up and puts on her coat. \nNAOMI Yeah, yeah, you just. \nARTHUR Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it to get to this! I planned to just be your friend but then I started to fall for you and I thought `I can't marry Susan, I might fall for Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to marry Susan or I'll be poor so I won't fall for Naomi' But then I did fall for you! Because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours. You're too smart, Snart. Smart Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal. (BEAT) Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne, and I said `I can't marry Susan, I love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I don't know any more. \nNAOMI You're frog. \nARTHUR Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if you don't marry Susan, I'll make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you can't - ha ha ha'. Okay she didn't laugh but she might as well have, the evil cow. Because it's like all the money ever and they'll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad, like in Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and Oliver and.... \nNEWSSTAND GUY And even shared the tears. \nA Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window. \nNEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D) You're the only one who really knew me at all. \nThe song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well- rehearsed dance. \nARTHUR (lip syncing too) So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face. (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face...Just take a look at me now. \nThe song builds to a dance crescendo. \nA magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no? \nNAOMI Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks. he's getting married. But I guess he didn't choreograph that bit for you. \nARTHUR But..but this took ages to rehearse. I had the frog outfit specially made. These aren't actual tourists. \nNAOMI I gathered that, Arthur. Are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture? \nARTHUR What do you mean? \nNAOMI It's like Hobson said. You're not like other men. If you were normal, if the money and the booze didn't cloud everything, you'd deal with the fact that you're engaged, rather than just looking for ways to win me back. But it was a lovely routine, really. Fantastic outfit. \nARTHUR I just wanted to see you. \nHe takes out his flask and has a swig. \nNAOMI (SYMPATHETIC) You need to see someone, Arthur. Seriously. \nINT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE. SHOWER - NIGHT \nArthur's in his cuboid David Blaine shower. He picks up his binoculars. \nARTHUR Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a haircut! Hobson? \nBut Marty pipes up on the little inset Hobson screen. He looks at a note in Hobson's handwriting. \nMARTY It says here you shouldn't forget to clean your junk. I guess that's what...'genitahlio-ah' is. \nARTHUR Marty? What are you doing there? \nMARTY Hobson left me in charge. She's gone to bed. She had a headache. \nARTHUR She's had quite a few headaches lately. \nMARTY She blacked out. \nINT. HOBSON'S ROOM. DAY \nHobson's in bed, watching a Discovery Channel documentary about grizzly bears. Arthur hits pause. \nHOBSON Put my bears back on, Arthur. \nARTHUR Not until you answer my question. \nHobson closes her eyes. She hams the next bit. \nHOBSON I'm travelling down a white tunnel. To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why is it so hot? Who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork? \nARTHUR Will you cut it out? \nHOBSON Arthur. There are three books. This is important. Take them back to the library... \nShe feigns a melodramatic death. \nARTHUR Hobson, please. Don't die any more. It's getting very boring. \nHOBSON Arthur. Old women, like bears, get sore heads. Are you okay? You look a little lost. \nARTHUR Naomi doesn't want to see me. \nHOBSON A terrible shame she had to go. A little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes. \nARTHUR Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk about Naomi that way again. What gives you the right to be such a snob? You're just...you're just... Mary Poppins with a menopause! \nArthur storms out, slamming the door. But within 10 seconds he returns, humbled, ashamed - a regretful naughty child. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hobson, I've never raised my voice to you. I'm sorry. \nThe car drives through Manhattan. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nArthur stares out of the window, beaten, drunk. \nARTHUR Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go every time I crave a drink? \nHobson doesn't even crack a smile. Arthur gets out his phone and scrolls - past Naomi's name, to Susan's. He dials. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Susan? Look, I know the wedding date is set. But fancy bringing it forward? I just want to get it over with. In a good way. Think about it, yeah? \nHe ends the call. Silence. He looks to Hobson. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) It's the agony of possibility, Hobson. It just hurts too much to know I could still be with Naomi if I had the guts. \nHOBSON Just promise you'll never ask me to sleep with Susan for you. \nEXT. MANHATTAN - DAY \nNaomi's riding the bus. Her phone rings. `Number withheld'. She rolls her eyes and answers. \nNAOMI Arthur, if that's... (BEAT) Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes. Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty hard on it..Love to...Love to...What time? \nIncredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER...RAINBOW PRESS...' \nNAOMI (CONT'D) I'll call in dead to work. Bye. \nShe writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThere's a ring at the doorbell. Ralph answers. It's Hobson. \nHOBSON Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi here? \nRALPH You must be the nanny. \nHOBSON I must be. \nRalph embraces her. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) Please stop this, I can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles. \nRalph releases her. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back I could enter this dwelling. \nNaomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide. \nNAOMI Well, well. \nRALPH Ever since I met Arthur I liked him. We have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together... \nHOBSON Try not to talk. It's not your words but the breath which bears them. Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea? I wish to speak to Naomi. \nRALPH Sure, sure. \nRalph leaves. \nHOBSON Arthur is having a pre-wedding party tonight. You should come. \nNAOMI Oh, should I? Are all the other girls he passed up going too? \nHobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it. \nHOBSON Don't you want to show Arthur how well you're doing? \nNAOMI Tell him thanks, but I have a deadline. \nHOBSON Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. You could bring your father. A magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment. \nNAOMI (DISBELIEF) Why would I go to this? Why would I do that to myself? \nHOBSON My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. And the food promises to be breathtakingly free. \nHobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down. \nNAOMI Are you alright? \nHOBSON Better than you, dear. \nNaomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed to see her go. She looks around for Arthur, getting admiring looks from other men - and women. \nPASSING WOMAN Nice dress. Vera Wang? \nNAOMI Ross Dress For Less. You know where Arthur is? \nPASSING WOMAN (SHRUGS) Sorry. \nNaomi moves on. The Door Man appears, looking around for the gatecrasher. The man whose arm she took on the way in - he's called JUSTIN - is also on the prowl for her... \nINT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nBurt takes to the stage to applause. \nBURT When Arthur proposed to my daughter, I was overjoyous. The Bach-Templemeads are my kind of people: classy. Respectable. Well spoken. People like in Shakespeare in Love, who esprouse the same values I have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life. But tonight isn't about me or America's leading independent formula brand. \nArthur takes the stage to wild applause. \nARTHUR Thank you, Burt! I've actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here. \nThe band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters. Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Why does cash suddenly appear, every time you are near? \nThe audience laugh. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Just like me, it longs to be, close to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the sky, all of which, I can buy... (STOPS) I'll sing a proper song. (SINGS) You say potayto and I say potahto, You say tomayto and I say tomahto, potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto, Let's call the whole thing off! You say AA, and I say `no way', you say `Red Bull' and I say `Go away, Rehab, No way, Red Bull... \nINT. JOHNSON MANSION - ANOTHER LARGE ROOM \nJUSTIN approaches Naomi, who's still looking around for Arthur. \nJUSTIN We meet again! \nNAOMI Yeah. Have you seen Arthur? \nJUSTIN The ballroom. I'll take you to him. \nJustin takes Naomi's arm and leads her at a leisurely pace. They pass a portrait of Susan. \nJUSTIN (CONT'D) I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan. \nJustin points at a portrait of Susan. \nJUSTIN (CONT'D) Isn't she beautiful? \nNAOMI Of course she is. Why would Arthur marry a pig? \nThe Door Man appears, seeing Naomi. \nJUSTIN What business is your family in? \nNAOMI Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a fortune built on small pets. \nJUSTIN I'm sorry? \nNAOMI Hamsters, mice, doglets... \nJUSTIN Doglets? \nNAOMI Tiny dogs. The technology's not perfect. Seeing a horse the size of a can of soup fall dead before your eyes - that shit stays with you. \nThey walk through a door, ending up in a garden. \nEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT \nNAOMI Are you sure he's this way? \nJUSTIN Absolutely. \nNaomi turns to A WOMAN. \nNAOMI (to a WOMAN) Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur? \nWOMAN That way. The ballroom. \nNAOMI Bye, Justin. \nNaomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man. \nDOOR MAN Excuse me, madam. You're not an authorized guest. \nARTHUR She's a writer. \nNAOMI Is this the Vivienne? \nVIVIENNE Crowded field, writing. \nARTHUR Maybe someone will see her potential. \nVIVIENNE We all know who's seen her potential. \nNAOMI Meaning? \nVIVIENNE Oh, of course, you don't know, do you? \nArthur suddenly goes pale. \nARTHUR Vivienne, please. Don't... \nNAOMI What is going on here? \nVIVIENNE My son became fond of you. You're not the first. Or the last, I imagine. Anyway I was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? Rainbow Press. \nNAOMI You bought Rainbow press? So you could tell them to publish my book? \nVIVIENNE He knows people, dear. I'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll see you back at the party? Susan's a little worried. \nVivienne leaves. Naomi storms away. Arthur chases. \nARTHUR NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I would ever see you again. I was just trying to give you some... \nNAOMI (GASPS) Confidence? Self esteem isn't a gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love! \nArthur looks incredibly hurt. \nARTHUR I do express love! I love you! \nNAOMI Don't say that! \nARTHUR You just told me to! And stop going on about me being rich! You think it's easy being trapped by money? \nNaomi gets her old phone out. She speaks into it. \nNAOMI Hello, Amnesty? Come quick! Arthur's being held against his will in Guantamoney Bay! \nARTHUR Abu Greed? \nNAOMI Stop riffing with me! How dare you do what you did. I didn't need your money to feel good about myself! \nARTHUR No. Being cheap gives you that. \nNAOMI Huh? \nARTHUR At least I'm prepared to have fun. To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't I cool?' And...and...your phone's RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator, I bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it! \nNAOMI (BOILS OVER) As long as I don't get any from a drunk, rich fuck up like you! \nA door opens. \nSUSAN Hello? I heard shouting. \nNAOMI I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came to complain about the conditions. \nARTHUR Naomi, please... \nNAOMI Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement. (REALLY ANGRY) But some people prefer Coffee Mate! You were disrespectful. I quit! \nNaomi walks away, slamming a door behind her. \nSUSAN Because you changed the creamer? (BEAT) Arthur, Marty called from the hospital. \nARTHUR It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke to her doctor. \nSUSAN Apparently you didn't. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nHobson is lying in bed, looking even iller than before. \nHOBSON It's just a headache! \nARTHUR Stop saying that! You bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay! \nShe glances at a MASSIVE PILE OF BEAR DOCUMENTARY DVDs beside THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TEDDY BEAR. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) ...but I think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment. Which leaves option 2. \nArthur can't fight the tears any more. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) You're a good son, Arthur. You can do anything with your life that you want. Just like I did. \nARTHUR But you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat. \nHOBSON Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my use-by date. \nARTHUR Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one. I need you to care for me. (holds up a pill) Now take your fish oil. \nINT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT \nArthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start from a dream. He looks across to Hobson, who is very still. \nARTHUR Hobson? \nThe expensive monitor is dead. He jumps up. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) HOBSON! (hammering the machine) Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off? (SHOUTS) GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT... \nHe sees that the monitor is unplugged. The cord is in Hobson's hand. It's over. Hobson's dead. \nArthur sobs his heart out. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt's a few weeks later. The place is very, very messy. The place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of paint. \nSPLOTCH! A big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered. \nArthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army paintball tank. He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint at the teddy. The tank turret rotates. He shoots walls, possessions, furniture. He stops. \nARTHUR Would Frog ever get up again? Or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich. \nHe looks down at an ashes urn. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hobson! Why are you in there when I need you? (lifts lid off urn) HOBSON! \nHe's rewarded with a face full of ashes. Angrily he spins the turret through 360 degrees, firing paint. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Arrrrgghhh! \nMarty comes in - and is hit hard by paint. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Sorry. \nMARTY How's the tea? \nARTHUR Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty. \nMARTY Want to talk about the Cubs game? \nARTHUR Nahhh. Can I be alone please? \nMarty goes. Arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to Naomi's name. He thinks for a moment, hits `call'. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS \nNaomi is shopping. She looks at the phone, sees Arthur's name. She so wants to answer. But doesn't. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nArthur stands on the balcony. He peers down at Manhattan far, far below. \nINT. PIERRE HOTEL - HOTEL BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nA COUPLE are having sex. A BODY falls past the window. \nINT. PIERRE HOTEL - RESTAURANT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe body falls past a window. A huge crash from off. \nEXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nPASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock. \nTilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof. \nARTHUR Naomi! \nArthur pushes his way through the tourists. He sees her bus and headset. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) You're on a bus? With a microphone? \nNAOMI Girl's gotta have a dream. \nARTHUR Naomi. Can you take the next 60 years off? \nNAOMI Are you okay? You're a mess. You look like you...now. \nARTHUR Sorry. I accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer. Fascinating story...Okay. (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Drinking was the only way I could get the courage to come here and say this: I don't need the money. I love the money. But I don't lie awake all night wondering how I'll live without ever seeing it again. I just wonder what it's like to go 24 hours without a steak tartare. \nNaomi looks unconvinced. Arthur pulls out his wallet and takes out a load of credit cards. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) The American Express Centurion card - you have to spend at least $250,000 a year to keep it, which I blow in a quiet week. \nHe drops it down a drain. He produces another card. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard for art collectors. \nDrops it down drain too. The tourists are enjoying this. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) And King of all idiotic reckless- SPEND-THE-FUCK-OUT-OF-EVERYTHING- FOR-TOMORROW-WE-DIE PLASTIC insanity: the Visa Black Card. \nThis last one he hands to a PASSING HOMELESS MAN. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) PIN 3487. Daily ATM limit $180,000. \nThe man runs into the road. As Arthur talks, out of focus we see the man hit by a car, but get up and keep going. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (producing fancy iPhone) The world's only platinum iPhone. With police radio app. \nHe tosses it over his shoulder. It lands in the beef juice pan of a Street French Dip stall. A BIGGER CROWD is gathering. Arthur takes off his jacket. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Alexander Amosu. Vicuna wool, shorn once every three years from the South American camelid - $50,000. \nHe throws the jacket in a passing cab's window. He takes off his pants. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Westmancott trousers, ten months to design, fit and make. $21,000. \nHe hands the trousers to a PASSERBY. Off with his watch! \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (SHOUTS) Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong wore to step on the sun! \nArthur flings it in the air. A crazed fight breaks out. \nArthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) These are from The Gap. \nNAOMI I'm so sorry about Hobson. \nThey step away from the tourists. \nARTHUR I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press. \nNAOMI It's okay. So how did Susan take it that you're not marrying her? \nARTHUR She didn't. \nNAOMI You haven't told her? \nARTHUR What's it to you? She's your arch- enemy. \nNAOMI Are you six? She isn't my enemy. She's the woman you proposed to! \nARTHUR I couldn't tell her! Today's the biggest day of her life! \nNAOMI The wedding's today? When? \nARTHUR 12. Which is... (looks at his wrist) Where's my watch gone? \nNAOMI (looks at her watch) It's eight minutes to. \nARTHUR It's too late, then. \nNaomi hands Arthur her phone. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) TAXI! \nA taxi stops. Arthur throws the money to THE DRIVER. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) How far can I go with $1.95 and a Japanese coin with a hole in it? \nDRIVER A block and a half. \nARTHUR GO! \nArthur jumps in. The cab screeches away. \nEXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY \nThe cab halts. Arthur jumps out and starts running again. He sees A BUS with `COLUMBUS CIRCLE' in its window. \nWe cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front bicycle rack. But the DRIVER sees him and hits the brakes. Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running. \nHe sees a Subway Station. \nARTHUR (TO PASSERBY) Excuse me, are there trains down there, like in films? \nPASSERBY Yes. \nArthur runs down the steps. \nINT. SUBWAY - DAY \nA train pulls on to the platform. Arthur leaps aboard. \nINT. TRAIN - DAY \nArthur stands among New Yorkers, none of whom bat an eyelid at his appearance. He looks up at the stations. \nARTHUR (to A MALE PASSENGER) Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother you, but... \nWithout looking at him, the guy hands him a dollar. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Crikey. Thanks. \nINT. CHURCH. SACRISTY - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nSusan is ready. She looks to the door. Erica, who is peering out, shakes her head with an `I told you so' look. \nINT. NAOMI'S TOUR BUS - DAY \nNaomi's driving her bus up 42nd Street. \nNAOMI (into a headset mic) ...originally a rough neighbourhood. Some say it was called 42nd Street because it wasn't safe to spend more than forty seconds on it. \nA few grudging laughs from the tourists. \nMALE TOURIST Excuse me. \nNAOMI If you burst into song, you're off this bus. \nMALE TOURIST Huh? I want to see St. John the Divine. \nNAOMI Sorry, sir, that's not on our route today. Anyway... \nFEMALE TOURIST I want to know if Arthur's gonna make it. \nOTHER FEMALE TOURIST (CONT'D) You should be there for him. \nOther tourists agree. \nMALE TOURIST (WAVES LEAFLET) It says here `ask about your personalised tours'. I want the personalised tour. To St. John the Divine! \nALL OTHER TOURISTS So do I! St. John the Divine, St. John the Divine, St. John the... \nNAOMI Okay! \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nArthur comes bounding out of another station. Clutching his dollar, he sees a bus. He runs aboard, and up to the driver. \nARTHUR Ah! I'm trying to get to... \nArthur feels eyes on him. The bus is full of SCHOOL CHILDREN! It's a school bus! They all stare for a beat, then get out cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping carts. He starts emptying them of quarters. \nMANAGER Hey! \nArthur pushes past Erica. \nINT. CHURCH. ALTAR - NIGHT \nArthur stumbles out on the altar. The CONGREGATION stares. He taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up. \nARTHUR Good evening, St. John the Divine! Anyone in from St. Patrick's? Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan Mosque? AA? \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nNaomi's tour bus screeches up. She hurries out. \nSINT. CHURCH - DAY \nArthur's still before the congregation, telling a story. \nARTHUR ...and the first turned to the second horse and said `That dog just spoke'. \nThe hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can muster. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) The joke being that it's inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog can't. \nNaomi creeps in at the back. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) The wedding's off. The bride has had second thoughts. I can't say I blame her. Would you marry me? (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (PAUSE) You won't be seeing me again, as I'm going to be poor. I'll be shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six pork chops for under a dollar! \nTIGER WOODS discreetly scribbles `99c Store, chops' on a torn- out Bible page. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Great. I'm glad we had this talk. I'll let you get on with the wedding.... \nA huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard. Burt, crazed with hatred, drags him by his hair off the altar. \nINT. CHURCH. SACRISTY. DAY - CONTINUOUS \nBurt is bashing Arthur's head HARD against a stone font. \nSUSAN Daddy, no! Stop it! \nVivienne bursts in. Followed by Naomi. \nVIVIENNE Burt! Get off my son! \nBut nothing's going to stop Burt. \nSUSAN (louder than anyone yet) DADDY!!! \nSusan is over Burt, brandishing a Virgin Mary statue. \nBURT You wouldn't hurt me. \nSUSAN Wouldn't I? You crushed me. \nBURT I just wanted you to be happy. \nSUSAN Bullshit. You wanted to stop me being a lesbian! \nBURT Shut up! Shut up you dirty little dyke harlot! \nErica leaps on Burt, pummelling his face with her fists. \nERICA You want some more, bitch? Huh? \nArthur looks up at Susan. \nSUSAN Erica, that's enough, honey. \nErica stops. Susan kisses her. \nARTHUR Why didn't you tell me? We could have worked something out. \nNaomi give Arthur a look. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm joking. \nINT. CHURCH - LATER \nThe church is empty, apart from Arthur and Naomi on the altar. Naomi's trying to remove something from Arthur's neck. Vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back. \nARTHUR OW! Stop it! Why are you doing that? \n", "test1_input": "ARTHUR \nWritten by \nPeter Baynham \nEXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT \nA HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district. \nThe street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches. \nA huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover. \nBAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars. \nWe hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'. \nSirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit. \nThe Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away. \nThe cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn. \nA HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light. \nROOKIE COP Cooool. \nAn older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume - lowers the window and offers a handshake. \nARTHUR Evening, Constable! \nOLDER COP 1 (seen it all before) Hi, Arthur. \nARTHUR Are you familiar with the expression `I can explain everything'? \nOLDER COP 1 Out of the car, please. \nARTHUR Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out. This one has no doors, so I'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. Which nobody wants... (TO COP 2) Apart from you, cheeky monkey! (BEAT) It's a joke! Okay, okay. \nArthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles. \nOLDER COP 1 Okay, explain everything. \nARTHUR Well. What with having spunked 1.6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround, I thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells? It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead? Will I have to do traffic school? \nOLDER COP 2 How much have you drunk, Arthur? \nARTHUR To use the technical medical term - megabloodyshitloads. Either that or I've had a stroke! But fret not, I have a designated driver. \nThe cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume. \nHOMELESS ROBIN Where's my five thousand dollars? \nArthur counts out a huge wad of cash. \nARTHUR The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven. (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan. \nHOMELESS ROBIN It's LIZARDS! English prick! \nArthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1. \nARTHUR I trust this will cover all repairs to New York and any inconvenience to your good selves? \nHe turns and tries to get back in. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the other chap. \nThe bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile. \nINT. 23RD PRECINCT. CELL - NIGHT - LATER \nArthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye. \nJAY, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur, who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated. Cash sticks out of various pockets. \nJAY Then the crazy motherfucker cut me! \nARTHUR Goodness. Why? \n", "test1_true": "ARTHUR Rude man. And who threw hot Americano in whose face again? \nJAY I did in his. No half and half neither. That shit burnt! \nJay laughs hard, as does GARY, another crook. Arthur, out of politeness, tries to join in the laughter. \nGARY I burnt my sister's hair. \nJAY (high fiving him) Cool... \nGARY Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause I don't fit her definition of hygiene. Plenty of places to take a shit, toilet's just one of them. Just ask the a-rabs. \nARTHUR It's like a chat show, this. (looking into an imaginary CAMERA) It's been said of my next guest, by Jay the bandaged lunatic, that she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out, whacked-up asswipe'. (to a PROSTITUTE) Carmella, when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore? \nPROSTITUTE Mother died when I was six. \nARTHUR Oh G-d, I hate when that happens. \nPROSTITUTE My father raped me when I was twelve. \nARTHUR Sounds like you had six relatively good years. \nJAY What do you do? \nARTHUR I model riding boots, I spend money, I sleep with women. But I have weekends off and I am my own boss. \nThe cell door swings open. \nOLDER COP 1 Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G- d-lawyer's here. \nARTHUR (STANDING) I never thought New York's underbelly could be quite such agreeable company. I shall never forget you. Farewell. \nThe crooks look back at him sulkily. Arthur looks guilty. \nINT. 23RD PRECINCT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT - LATER \nArthur's attorney ELVERTON DEVERE is leaving with him. \nDEVERE I don't think your mother will be pleased, Arthur. \nARTHUR Really, Elverton - if a chap can't help out a few chums, whatever their station in life. \nThe other crooks from the cell are leaving alongside them. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Each has given his or her word to put the criminal life behind them. \nEXT. 23RD PRECINCT. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nArthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes. \nARTHUR I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep easy tonight. \nJAY (points at A CAMERAMAN) Don't point that shit at me, bitch! I will FUCK YOU UP! \nJay attacks the cameraman violently. Gary piles in. \nHOMELESS ROBIN Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards! \nArthur pushes past the press. \nPRESS Arthur! What will your mother say? Didn't she send you here to get you out of the British papers? Arthur! \nHe turns to those crooks who aren't fighting. \nARTHUR Anyone need a job? My last driver resigned after I filled his limo with squirrels. Preferably sober, clean driving licence? \nThe crooks all look unsure. Apart from one.... \nTITLES \nEXT. MANHATTAN- NIGHT \nA different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park, the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his name's MARTY - at the wheel. \nThe car passes A MALE JOGGER. It stops and backs up. Arthur opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne. The jogger gets in. The car sets off again. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Anyone know a good bar? \nEXT. CLUB - NIGHT \nThe car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club. Out falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys. Following him are his crook friends, the jogger, TWO MIDDLE-AGED TOURISTS and A DANCING MAN in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `CHEAP APARTMENT RENTALS!' \n", "test1_id": 2769, "test2_input": "NAOMI `It doesn't remotely matter how much or what you spend it on' rich? \nArthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Craziest thing you ever bought? \nARTHUR I once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed \u00a3100,000 to open a falafel stall. \nShe laughs. She stops laughing. \nNAOMI Oh my G-d, you're serious. \nARTHUR What's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party? \nNAOMI I once said the Manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `You've got Mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime. \nA sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes out a huge ancient Motorola phone. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it. (PHONE BLEEPS) Gotta go, battery. Love you too. \nShe ends the call. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Mom died last year. For eight months dad ate nothing but Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI. So I persuaded him to move in with me. Where he eats Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI. \nARTHUR Sounds like you're very good to him. \nNAOMI What are you gonna do? All those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the TV. And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you! Go to bed.' Weird, huh? \nARTHUR (not relating at all) Yeah. I hate that. (looks at her phone) Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you find that? \nNAOMI AT&T store in 1998. \nARTHUR It's...You've had it twelve years? \nNAOMI It's a fine phone. Battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations. \nSomething weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) I can't believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit. CDs come along, so out with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in, out with the CDs. I just kept the vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be incredibly hip once every 20 years.... \nA beat. She looks around. And down. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? \nCutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is being lifted off the ground by a crane! \nARTHUR I couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. So it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it ace? \nThe whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher. \nNAOMI No it is not ace, you crazy English bastard! This is dangerous! \nARTHUR Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put these on. \nHe pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. He straps her in. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (LAUGHING) Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe. It's this company called `Aerial Delights'. They specialise in catering unusual events at a height of 180 feet above the ground. \nA gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. Naomi screams. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) So what got you into the walking tours? \nNAOMI You're seriously making date small talk while this is going on? \nARTHUR Be still. Breathe deep. (strikes a Zen pose) `When you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': Huanchu Daoeren. \nNAOMI `Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart. \nARTHUR (handing her something) Taste this truffle. \nNaomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here. \nNaomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne. \nNAOMI What the hell. Gotta go sometime, right? At least it won't be years of pain like mom. Just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth. \nARTHUR So anyway. The tours... \nNAOMI (CALMING HERSELF) Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still. The tours are a temporary nine year fill-in until I'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round. \nARTHUR What did you write? \n", "test2_true": "ARTHUR Kids can be so cruel... \nNAOMI (INTERRUPTING) Arthur? We have a problem. \nARTHUR I told you, don't worry. These crane people know what they're doing! \nNAOMI Not that kind of problem. \nArthur feels a blade at his throat. He looks up to see A JUNKIE, CLEARLY HIGH, standing over him. \nJUNKIE Phone. And the watch. Hurry. \nArthur hands him his phone and watch. \nARTHUR Um. Out of interest, how did you get up here? \nJUNKIE What you talkin' about, dog? \nWe see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree! \nNAOMI Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed by `Robbed in the sky'! \nArthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket for his wallet. Naomi gets involuntary giggles too. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) This isn't funny, you lunatic. \nThe junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from the bottle, then walks away. Phew. Then... \nARTHUR AND NAOMI NOOOO! \nThe junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! Arthur jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. He grabs the junkie's arm. The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand. \nARTHUR OWWW! You don't understand! We're 180 feet up in the sky! \nJUNKIE (LAUGHS) You on the same shit as me, yeah? Good stuff, right? \nARTHUR No, we're not high! Well we are, but only in the literal sense. \nThe junkie hurries away again. He's about to walk off the edge. Arthur runs and grabs him. They end up in a messy struggle, the platform rocking badly. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (TO NAOMI) Hit the panic button! It's next to the truffle station! \nNaomi's panicking, searching desperately. Arthur and the junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge! \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hurry! \nNAOMI I can't find it. Over here? \nARTHUR No! That's the bouquet of world hams! \nNaomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button. Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off. The driver starts to lower the platform. \nNaomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie, but she gets slashed on the ear. She screams. \nAs the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the land and tips them all into the river! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARTHUR'S CAR - NIGHT \nNaomi and Arthur - his face bruised - are sitting in the car, both dripping wet. Naomi's ear and Arthur's hand are bandaged. \nARTHUR I had fun tonight. \nShe stares at him as if he's utterly crazy. \nNAOMI I can't believe I'm saying this, but so did I. \nINT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE - BALLROOM DAY \nThe room has started to fill with groom's paraphernalia - morning suits, top hats, shoes. Erica is sitting with a huge sheaf of wedding admin and brochures. Vivienne, Burt and Susan listen attentively, studying seating plans. It all feels more like a council of war than a wedding preparation. \nERICA Summarising Phase Alpha: formal wear for bridal attendants, groom's attendants, mens' formal wear, St John the Divine all confirmed... \nARTHUR'S lying on a chaise longue, hungover. A TAILOR stretches a tape measure along him as if measuring a corpse. \nARTHUR (TO TAILOR) Are there breathing holes in the coffin? \nTAILOR I'm sorry? \nARTHUR In case I'm passed out drunk rather than medically dead? \n", "test2_id": 2770, "test3_input": "He slips her a dollar and whispers to her. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Quick, before someone gets it. \nNaomi gazes at a different Arthur to the fool who nearly got her killed. \nOLD WOMAN (TO NAOMI) You got a good one here, honey. \nShe hurries away. \nARTHUR Look. Us in a year's time. \nANOTHER OLD COUPLE push a cart past. THE OLD WOMAN sneezes. The old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) If you got ill, I'd care for you. \nNAOMI I'll get ill. \nThe music changes. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get out when they start playing Phil Collins. Want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart? \nINT. HIGH END RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nArthur, Susan and Erica - her laptop open - are at dinner. Hobson's salting Arthur's soup, then checking the temperature. \nERICA Tiger Woods has confirmed! \nARTHUR I didn't know you knew him. \nSUSAN I don't. \nARTHUR Why is he coming? \nSUSAN He agreed to daddy's fee. This is going to be the happiest day of my life! \nShe looks at Hobson. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Why is she here all the time? \nARTHUR If you can bring Erica, I can bring Hobson. \nSUSAN She's my wedding planner. \nARTHUR She's my Hobson. \nHobson leans into Arthur while tidying his napkin. \nHOBSON (WHISPERING) Tell Naomi. That's an order. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. NIGHT \nArthur's giving stunned Naomi a tour of the huge apartment. \nARTHUR Reminiscent of a French castle perched 500 feet above New York, the penthouse was known from early days as the `Chateau in the Sky'. \nHe leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom. \nNAOMI A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta have a second ballroom. \nARTHUR Where George Gershwin and the Astors danced to Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra. \nHe grabs her in a ballroom dance move. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred Austere and Stingy Rogers. \nNAOMI (PULLING AWAY) I just need one of your collection of bathrooms. \nARTHUR Behind the telephone box fish tank. See you on the balcony. \nArthur goes onto the balcony. Naomi's notices a figure sitting in the dark, stifling a cough. Hobson. \nNAOMI Hobson? \nHOBSON He's not like other men, you know. \nNAOMI I think I realised that as I plunged into the Hudson with a junkie. But I like him. He's fun. \nHobson fights another little cough. She gets up. \nHOBSON I know he is. That's the problem. \n", "test3_true": "HOBSON I'm sure Arthur will explain. \nEXT. BALCONY - NIGHT \nThe live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers. Arthur and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording. \nNaomi sips her wine. Arthur throws back a whisky. \nARTHUR Your kids' book. What was it about? \nNAOMI `Vlad the Inhaler'. About an asthmatic boy detective. \nARTHUR Be serious. \nNAOMI Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose Heart Escaped'. It was about this kid who wakes up to find his heart has climbed out and is shinning down the drainpipe to freedom. \nARTHUR I love it. \nNAOMI Rainbow Press said it was too disturbing. But it wasn't literal - there wasn't a kid lying there with a gaping hole in his chest. It was just this cute little heart bouncing up and down shouting `You can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm paraphrasing. \nARTHUR Did he catch the heart? \nNAOMI Never got that far. \nArthur wobbles a little more. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) You like the hooch, don't you? \nARTHUR Only if I'm sad, happy or bored. There's this bit in a book Hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `We must stop eating cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he ate another.' \nNAOMI Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and Toad! \nARTHUR (FROM MEMORY) `Frog put the cookies in a box. `There' he said. Now we will not eat any more cookies.' `But we can open the box.' Frog tied some string around the box. `There' he said, `Now we will not eat any more cookies'. `But we can cut the string and open the box'. \nNaomi lays her head on Arthur's shoulder. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) So Frog took the box outside. He shouted in a loud voice, `Hey birds, here are cookies!' Birds came from everywhere. They picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away. ` (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Now we have no more cookies to eat' `Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going home now to bake a cake.' (BEAT) Classic addict. \nThey might be about to kiss. But Arthur holds back. \nNAOMI That was beautiful. It's like you read it yesterday. \nINT. ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nArthur's blissed out face, lying in bed in the soft light. \nHOBSON (OOV) Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon. \nHobson's reading `Frog and Toad' to Arthur. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea. They were two close friends sitting alone together. \nHobson closes the book and turns out the light. \nARTHUR I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my toad. \nHOBSON You're quite sure about this? \nARTHUR Yes. \nHOBSON (under her breath) Oh, bollocks. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY \nNaomi's sitting with Ralph, who's scratching off lottery tickets. \nRALPH I don't know, honey. What's this teabag even doing here? Couldn't he make it in Lord of the Rings land? \nNAOMI Not that it matters, but he's a billionaire. \nRALPH You have my full permission to marry him. \nEXT. SHOWJUMPING FIELD. DAY \nA HORSE clears a showjumping barrier. Grant applauds. \nGRANT Bravo, Vivienne! Well done! \nArthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and Hobson wait in the Bentley. \n", "test3_id": 2771}

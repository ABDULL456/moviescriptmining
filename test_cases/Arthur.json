{"test1_input": "SOFIA Is she going to stay here? \nARTHUR Hobson, could you come back in a minute and a half please? \nHOBSON Negative. You're seeing your mother this morning. \nARTHUR Nobody told me. \nHOBSON Actually I did, on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as `last night'. \nHobson picks up Sofia's panties and bra from the floor like a crime scene officer. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear. Addictive personality. He was at mine until he was six. \nARTHUR Hobson! Really... \nHOBSON I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off... \nSOFIA I can't do this. \nShe pulls away from Arthur, grabs her clothes and jumps out of bed, nearly tipping Arthur out. \nHOBSON I support your decision 100%. Will you be requiring a taxi, or just be getting in a random passing car? \nSofia storms to the door, clutching her clothes. Arthur can see other revellers being removed by HOTEL SECURITY. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) Say goodbye to your new friends, Arthur. They have to go back to the recession now. \nArthur covers his head with the sheet. \nARTHUR Cancel my mother please, Hobson. I'll work from bed today. \nBut Hobson hits a touch-sensitive screen on the wall. The magnetic bed thuds to the ground. She taps another control. \nMUSIC: HORRIBLE, DEAFENING DEATH METAL \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Not the death metal, please! \nHOBSON (shouting over the music) Aren't you a fan of Carcass? \nHobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre. \nARTHUR OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP! \nArthur sits up. Hobson stops the music. \nHOBSON Good boy. \nARTHUR I'm going for a shower. \nHOBSON I'll alert the media. \nEXT. BALCONY SHOWER - DAY \nArthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine stunt. Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's ceiling. Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet as he showers. \nARTHUR (SINGING) To Bombay, a travelling circus came... \nArthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook. \nHOBSON They brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name...Hobson! \nWe see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall. She's on a phone at Arthur's computer. \nARTHUR Female Tom Hanks! \nINT. SITTING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nHobson - in front of an Ebay screen full of purchases - picks up her own pair of binoculars and looks down. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Heading east towards Park Avenue. \nThrough Hobson's binoculars we see A MIDDLE-AGED BUSINESSWOMAN who does look vaguely like a female Tom Hanks! \nHOBSON She's early today... \nARTHUR Can we invite her up and dress her as Forrest Gump? \nHOBSON No. \n", "test1_true": "HOBSON Do your armpits. (INTO PHONE) (MORE) \nHOBSON (CONT'D) Mr. Miller? My employer inexplicably agreed to purchase your... (READS SCREEN) `Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping costs? Sorry, but that transaction will take place over my dead body, and I'm feeling rather well today. \nINT. SHOWER - DAY \nArthur's still peering down through his binoculars. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Hobson! That was your birthday present! You like bears! \nA PRIEST WITH THIN SIDEBURNS emerges from A DINER... \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Father Wolverine... \nA MASTURBATING MAN IN A 70TH STORY APARTMENT OPPOSITE... \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Wank Williams...That man has the constitution of an ox. \nHobson glances up at Arthur, washing himself on the screen. \nHOBSON That reminds me, clean your genitals. Heaven knows what wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs. \nINT. ARTHUR'S DOJO. DAY - LATER \nArthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt, is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music. \nARTHUR I give you `Sideways farting spider'. \nHobson is sitting, exasperated, going through various expenditures. \nHOBSON Arthur, you have to stop giving money away! \nARTHUR I'm a philanthropist. \nHOBSON With the emphasis on the `pissed'. Really, what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it? The way you're going, you'll have spent your inheritance before you've inherited it. \nARTHUR (shifts to new pose) `Eagle pointing at lesbian.' \nHOBSON Why did you fire Jessica? \nARTHUR What kind of yoga teacher won't let a pupil invent positions? She was a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D. (CHANGING POSE) `Upwards Pooping Astronaut'. \nHOBSON Interesting. It looks more like `Rich twit hiding from mother.' May I remind you, she finances your preposterous existence... \nARTHUR I know, I know. Never bite the hand that fists me. \nEXT. MANHATTAN - DAY \nArthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley. Marty's at the wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap and tie. As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager. He nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager. \nMARTY Sorry, fellas. \nHOBSON (CONSPIRATORIAL) You don't seriously intend to keep employing this gentleman? \nARTHUR Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He got laid off in Chicago... \nHOBSON But he doesn't know his way around New York! \nARTHUR So? I want interesting, fun people around me, not drones who just get the job done... \nArthur sees something out of the window. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Marty! Stop the car! \nMarty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward. \nEXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT \nArthur hurries up to A SMALL GROUP OF TOURISTS. \nWOMAN (O.S.) The Chrysler Building. Designed by William Van Allen... \nA TOUR GUIDE wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking. She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a clipboard. We understand why Arthur stopped the car. \nNAOMI ...and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, this magnificent structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before the Empire State stole its thunder. \nShe looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) The Chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the 1928 Cement Famine and had to melt down his Chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top. If you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk twice if you voted Hoover.' \nSome tourists laugh. Some don't. Arthur's transfixed. \n", "test1_id": 2769, "test2_input": "She glances at a MASSIVE PILE OF BEAR DOCUMENTARY DVDs beside THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TEDDY BEAR. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) ...but I think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment. Which leaves option 2. \nArthur can't fight the tears any more. \nHOBSON (CONT'D) You're a good son, Arthur. You can do anything with your life that you want. Just like I did. \nARTHUR But you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat. \nHOBSON Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my use-by date. \nARTHUR Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one. I need you to care for me. (holds up a pill) Now take your fish oil. \nINT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT \nArthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start from a dream. He looks across to Hobson, who is very still. \nARTHUR Hobson? \nThe expensive monitor is dead. He jumps up. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) HOBSON! (hammering the machine) Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off? (SHOUTS) GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT... \nHe sees that the monitor is unplugged. The cord is in Hobson's hand. It's over. Hobson's dead. \nArthur sobs his heart out. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt's a few weeks later. The place is very, very messy. The place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of paint. \nSPLOTCH! A big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered. \nArthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army paintball tank. He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint at the teddy. The tank turret rotates. He shoots walls, possessions, furniture. He stops. \nARTHUR Would Frog ever get up again? Or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich. \nHe looks down at an ashes urn. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hobson! Why are you in there when I need you? (lifts lid off urn) HOBSON! \nHe's rewarded with a face full of ashes. Angrily he spins the turret through 360 degrees, firing paint. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Arrrrgghhh! \nMarty comes in - and is hit hard by paint. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Sorry. \nMARTY How's the tea? \nARTHUR Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty. \nMARTY Want to talk about the Cubs game? \nARTHUR Nahhh. Can I be alone please? \nMarty goes. Arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to Naomi's name. He thinks for a moment, hits `call'. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS \nNaomi is shopping. She looks at the phone, sees Arthur's name. She so wants to answer. But doesn't. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nArthur stands on the balcony. He peers down at Manhattan far, far below. \nINT. PIERRE HOTEL - HOTEL BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nA COUPLE are having sex. A BODY falls past the window. \nINT. PIERRE HOTEL - RESTAURANT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe body falls past a window. A huge crash from off. \nEXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nPASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock. \nTilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof. \n", "test2_true": "Arthur's on his phone again. \nARTHUR (leaving a message) Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson died and I've fallen apart... \nThe doorbell rings from off. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Marty! Can you get that? Marty! (INTO PHONE) Naomi? Could you get it? Hello? \nHe throws the cellphone off the roof. A couple of seconds pass. We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nArthur opens the door. It's Vivienne. \nVIVIENNE Arthur! You haven't answered the phone for eight days. Susan's beside herself. What's going on? \nARTHUR What do you think's going on? Hobson died. \nVIVIENNE Oh, that. \nShe bustles in past Arthur. A PLATOON OF MAIDS follows. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) (TO MAIDS) Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio! Come on, Arthur. Have to pick yourself up, lad. It's like when Nixon my Great Dane had to be put down. Frightful state for days. But I pulled myself together. \nARTHUR You're comparing Hobson to...a dog? \nVIVIENNE Well, yes. A faithful, humble companion who... \nARTHUR Um, I think I'd like you to leave, if that's okay. Now? \nVIVIENNE Remember who pays for this apartment, Arthur. For everything! \nHe guides her out the door. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) You had damn well better be at that wedding, boy. \nARTHUR Don't worry. If I'm going to drink myself to death I'll need resources. Bye Vivienne... \nVIVIENNE It's mother! \nARTHUR My mother's dead. \nHe slams the door. The phone rings again. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hello? I'm sorry? \nINT. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nArthur is sitting in an estate attorney's next to MR FINKE, a small, dirty man. ATTORNEY MARGARET AHERNE is at a desk opposite them, reading from a will. \nAHERNE The last will and testament of Jane Hobson. (READS) `I leave my life savings to the Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare County, California.' \nAherne hands Mr Finke A CHECK for $8,864. \nARTHUR That'll explain the strong smell of bear shit. Sorry. \nAherne opens a tiny envelope. \nAHERNE To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave this. \nShe produces a teabag. \nAHERNE (CONT'D) To operate kettle, press red button. Milk in refrigerator; that's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door. (PAUSE) Arthur. You're going to be okay. Now it's your turn to look after someone. All my deepest, fondest love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling down at you - or more likely, up at you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nClose up on the KETTLE, steam issuing forth from the spout. Then a MUG with the teabag in it. The kettle boils. A hand pours hot water into the mug. Milk is added. And a drop of vodka. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nBurt and Vivienne are standing outside, greeting GUESTS. \nBURT I just want you to know, if he doesn't show up for this wedding, I can't know what I'll do. \nVIVIENNE Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned himself up. He's stopped drinking, he's anxious to get a real job. He's become a responsible citizen. \nEXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY \nArthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the crowds. He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour bus. Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south. \nNAOMI Due to a tragic error in the architect's drawing, the original Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886 was just seven inches tall. 100,000 New Yorkers rioted, having come expecting to see something more impressive than a garden gnome holding up an ice cream... \n", "test2_id": 2770, "test3_input": "Arthur pushes past Erica. \nINT. CHURCH. ALTAR - NIGHT \nArthur stumbles out on the altar. The CONGREGATION stares. He taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up. \nARTHUR Good evening, St. John the Divine! Anyone in from St. Patrick's? Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan Mosque? AA? \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nNaomi's tour bus screeches up. She hurries out. \nSINT. CHURCH - DAY \nArthur's still before the congregation, telling a story. \nARTHUR ...and the first turned to the second horse and said `That dog just spoke'. \nThe hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can muster. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) The joke being that it's inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog can't. \nNaomi creeps in at the back. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) The wedding's off. The bride has had second thoughts. I can't say I blame her. Would you marry me? (MORE) \nARTHUR (CONT'D) (PAUSE) You won't be seeing me again, as I'm going to be poor. I'll be shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six pork chops for under a dollar! \nTIGER WOODS discreetly scribbles `99c Store, chops' on a torn- out Bible page. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Great. I'm glad we had this talk. I'll let you get on with the wedding.... \nA huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard. Burt, crazed with hatred, drags him by his hair off the altar. \nINT. CHURCH. SACRISTY. DAY - CONTINUOUS \nBurt is bashing Arthur's head HARD against a stone font. \nSUSAN Daddy, no! Stop it! \nVivienne bursts in. Followed by Naomi. \nVIVIENNE Burt! Get off my son! \nBut nothing's going to stop Burt. \nSUSAN (louder than anyone yet) DADDY!!! \nSusan is over Burt, brandishing a Virgin Mary statue. \nBURT You wouldn't hurt me. \nSUSAN Wouldn't I? You crushed me. \nBURT I just wanted you to be happy. \nSUSAN Bullshit. You wanted to stop me being a lesbian! \nBURT Shut up! Shut up you dirty little dyke harlot! \nErica leaps on Burt, pummelling his face with her fists. \nERICA You want some more, bitch? Huh? \nArthur looks up at Susan. \nSUSAN Erica, that's enough, honey. \nErica stops. Susan kisses her. \nARTHUR Why didn't you tell me? We could have worked something out. \nNaomi give Arthur a look. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm joking. \nINT. CHURCH - LATER \nThe church is empty, apart from Arthur and Naomi on the altar. Naomi's trying to remove something from Arthur's neck. Vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back. \nARTHUR OW! Stop it! Why are you doing that? \n", "test3_true": "ARTHUR No, you keep still. \nHe kisses Naomi passionately. \nNAOMI What are we going to do, Arthur? \nARTHUR I'll get a job. I'll model cheap riding boots for people with no horses. You can write books about boys whose lungs have run away. \nVIVIENNE Stop this! \nVivienne walks up to the altar. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) A Bach-Templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, Arthur. That said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship. The inheritance is yours. All I ask is, with Hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother. \nARTHUR Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that. \nVIVIENNE I beg your pardon? \nARTHUR You've never earned that title. I wouldn't fake it with Susan. I won't with you. \nVIVIENNE Arthur. I will withdraw this offer forever. Don't doubt me, boy. \nARTHUR I don't. \nArthur shakes Vivienne's hand. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Take care, Viv. \nArthur takes Naomi by the hand and they leave the church. \nVIVIENNE Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If you walk out of that door... \nThey're gone. Vivienne sits in a pew. For once she looks small, old, alone. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nArthur and Naomi step into the daylight, pushing past paparazzi and press. Marty is waiting in the Batmobile, now repaired. \nARTHUR Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any more. Fancy joining us for a bowl of Special J? \nMarty gets out. The three walk away up Amsterdam Avenue. \nFADE OUT \nEXT. QUEENS - NIGHT \nCAPTION: ONE MONTH LATER \nARTHUR (O.S.) OW! \nINT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNaomi's typing, sipping `Sprike' (fake Sprite). Beside her is a printed manuscript titled `SNART'S FAKE NEW YORK - A Bogus guide to the World's Greatest City.' On the computer screen is: `...the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan, rendering every resident bald for a week.' \nARTHUR (O.S.) This is outrageous! \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. SHOWER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nArthur's struggling with a very crap, piddly shower. Rather than the glory of Manhattan from his shower-in-the-sky, Arthur just has a bare wall opposite to look out on. \nARTHUR Operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right! \nA hole in a pipe sprays his groin with hot water. He screams. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nRalph and Marty sit watching sports, Marty cheering as the Yankees are losing, Ralph miserable, The doorbell rings. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM DOOR. NIGHT \nRalph stands hammering at the bathroom door, holding a package. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Owww! My eyes! I'm blind! \nRalph hammers again. The bathroom door opens. Arthur's holding a giant bottle of cheap shampoo. His eyes are bright red, streaming. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What the hell's in this shampoo? Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea tree oil... \nRalph hands him the package. \nRALPH Package for you. With any luck an apartment for you and Lurch. \n", "test3_id": 2771}

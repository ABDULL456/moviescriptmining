Rest, 110 N.  State, in lieu of flowers contributions

CUT TO: 
A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE 
that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of 
Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that 
kind of grainy quality that things have when they've 
been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good 
looks. 
EXT. BO'S SECURITIES/WORLDWIDE - DAY 
Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in 
downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse. 
Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance- 
chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner. 
The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All 
major credit cards accepted." And then everything on 
the sign is translated into Spanish. 
INT. BO'S SECURITIES - DAY 
Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk 
listening to Annie.  He has some papers. 
ANNIE 
I need to know about him 
because... he's involved with 
my sister... 
DET. WHEEDLE 
Okay. 
ANNIE 
She has a pattern of getting 
involved with losers... Once 
she almost ran away with a 
human cannonball from the 
circus. 
DET. WHEEDLE 
Do you want a matrimonial, past 
wives, any kids-- 
ANNIE 
No, I know that part -- 
DET. WHEEDLE 
So you want a financial, is he 
a deadbeat, we can do a D&B -- 
ANNIE 
No, no, no, it's more like, who 
is he, does he have a sense of 
humor, is he nice -- no forget 
nice, I've got nice -- 
DET. WHEEDLE 
A sense of humor. 
ANNIE 
I'll tell you the truth, I 
heard this guy on a call-in 
radio show and I might not 
marry the person I should marry 
because I've become obsessed 
with him. 
DET. WHEEDLE 
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that 
movie. 
ANNIE 
No.  Not remotely.  I just want 
to find out about him. 
DET. WHEEDLE 
You want a tail. 
(picking up the phone) 
I got a guy in Seattle -- 
INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

woman?

Rez lays down a prayer mat. He kneels down and begins to pray. 
57   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY 
Glen stands smoking, staring at Chris.   Suddenly Glen speaks. 
GLEN I fucking... I swear I know you from somewhere? 
A BEAT. 
Chris can feel Glen's eyes on him. 
CHRIS I dunno... 
GLEN I do, I know you from somewhere. 
Chris stays silent. 
GLEN (CONT'D) D'you used to knock out pills? 
CHRIS (dismissive) Yeah, now and again. 
Glen carries on staring at him. 
GLEN Yeah, yeah, I know where I fucking know you from... you used to go out with Serena Ellis? 
CHRIS Yeah, a few years ago? 
GLEN You'd fucking hope so, she's dead you cunt. 
Glen laughs at his own joke. Chris looks furious. Shifty walks back over. 
SHIFTY Come! 
GLEN Right you done? (Shifty nods) Good. (MORE) GLEN (CONT'D) (he takes a final drag on his fag) Don't go blowing up any fucking tube trains. 
Glen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and storms off, Shifty follows after him. 
58   INT. LENNY'S CAR. DAY 
Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it to Lenny. 
GLEN What are we waiting for? 
LENNY Give me a fucking break I'm rushing my tits off... 
Lenny attempts to start the car. 
LENNY (CONT'D) Where's the keys babe? 
LORETTA Let's just go Lenny. I'm freaking out. 
Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive off, frog-hopping the VW down the road. 
GLEN Yeah, it's a good job we're not making a fucking scene. 
59   EXT. ROW OF GARAGES. DAY 
Chris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris stands there for a moment his fists clenched. 
SHIFTY Mate, are you alright?

SHIFTY What's the matter, what did he say? 
CHRIS Geezer don't worry about, just...don't worry about it, it's cool, I'm alright.

Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (sound of effect of breaking glass) Shot clock! 
The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A." begins playing on the loudspeaker. 
The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players, JAMAAL, notices Plissken. 
JAMAAL Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland. 
The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand, thumping chests, high-fiving each other. 
JAMAAL Welcome aboard, Snake. 
But Plissken pays no attention. He sees: 
CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA 
Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the court. 
CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA 
Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face. Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has a firm grip on the prototype. 
CUERVO JONES The time is now. We are the strongest. If we go together, the others will come. (beat) We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go together. What do you say? 
Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands... 
PLISSKEN 
Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye. 
PLISSKEN Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor... 
JAMAAL Sure, Snake. Anything. 
PLISSKEN I need to get across the court now... without drawing attention to myself. 
JAMAAL Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt! 
The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken. 
JAMAAL (whispers) You play much pick-up ball, Snake? 
Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end. 
JAMAAL Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man. 
The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball. The game is underway. 
Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover. They go into a set play. 
The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full combat. 
The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him flat. No foul. 
Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones. 
UTOPIA It's that weird guy again. 
Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit... 
Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands! 
JAMAAL Snake! Shot clock! 
THE SHOT CLOCK 
Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2... 
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly... 
Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn sounds just as it leaves his hand... 
THE BASKET 
Swish. Nothing but net.

105   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - SAME TIME                             105 
Jonah watches TV as Mike gets a beer out of the fridge. 
JONAH Dude, check this out. Your replacement's on. 
MIKE My what? 
Mike looks over to see -- 
ON THE TV -- Live footage from the Balloon Fiesta. Jack Magnum continues to alienate his audience. 
JACK MAGNUM Most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks. Let me assure you, you're in good hands. You're looking at a guy who's personally had sex with over 137 women. Most of them conscious. 
106   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                       106 
Abby looks at Joy, panicked. 
ABBY He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad- libbing? There's no ad-libbing. 
107   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                            107 
Mike sits down on the couch to watch. 
MIKE Oh, this is beautiful.

ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse. 
JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.) We're here at the Balloon Fiesta, and I'm supposed to be telling you men are full of hot air, but I think we all know, it's the ladies that are full of crap. Just because she says no, doesn't mean she means no. 
At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket. After a moment -- 
A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place. 
ABBY (ON T.V.) (nervous) Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will no longer be able to do "The Ugly Truth" segment. Which should really come as no surprise. Because men are completely unreliable. 
108   INT. KPHX - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                     108 
Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room, in shock. 
CLIFF What is she doing? 
The PHONE RINGS. Stuart picks up, then blanches. 
STUART (into phone) Hey, Harold. Yes, I know -- we're fixing it. 
109   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    109 
Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture. 
ABBY Take Mike Alexander, for instance. He up and quit the show without so much as a word. You think you know what men are going to do, you think you know what they want to do...but when it comes down to the moment where they actually have to nut up, they turn around and do something completely different.

110   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                         110 
Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys. 
MIKE Oh, I'm all over this. 
He races out, as Jonah calls after him. 
JONAH I don't think she's into you,guy! 
111   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    111 
Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records. 
ABBY The big, strong, romantic men we've been reading about in novels and watching in movies since we were nine? They're fallacies. "Blue Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie. Men are not strong. Men are not brave. Men are afraid. 
112   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                            112 * 
From the news desk, Georgia and Larry watch the monitor, confused. 
LARRY (offended) I love "Blue Lagoon". 
Georgia squeezes his hand. 
GEORGIA I know you do, honey. 
113   EXT. FIELD - PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      113 
Mike's truck careens into the parking lot. He gets out, racing towards the field. 
114   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    114 
Abby is now on a total tear. 
ABBY ...They're afraid to say what they feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to tell the truth. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008

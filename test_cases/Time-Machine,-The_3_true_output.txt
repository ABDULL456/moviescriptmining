No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows open the door that leads to the laboratory. 
Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the corridor. 
AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424 
Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to the door and finally bursts it open.  At the very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly. He stops short, gazing aghast. 
THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425 
The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING, leaving the present. 
Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner. Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl desolately in the center of the floor. 
CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426 
He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in. 
MRS. WATCHETT (nervous, breathless) Oh, Mr. Filby...what... (her eyes widen) 
FILBY (with finality) He's gone! 
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly approaches the center of the room.  Here, with squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the floor. 
MRS. WATCHETT (to Filby) There's something funny here, sir! 
Filby steps aside her to investigate. 
WHAT THEY SEE                                          427 
The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in the floor leading from the spot where the Machine was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory where it originally stood.  Here, not only its imprint, but also the color and finish of the floor is preserved. 
TWO SHOT                                               428 
They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby, puzzled. 
FILBY I think I understand. - Look! 
LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429 
Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint in the floor where the Machine first stood and explains. 
FILEY (pointing) See the imprint?  This is where the Time Machine originally stood. (he paces across to the end of the grooves) But the Morlocks moved it. They dragged it across the lawn right into the sphinx...right here. (turns and points) And Weena was standing there when he last saw her...the same space - in a different time. - So he moved back his heavy Machine from here, across the room, scratching this floor... (indicating the grooves that lead to the imprint) So that he can appear outside the sphinx again and help the Eloi build a new world...and build a new world of his own. 
MRS. WATCHETT (faintly, sentimentally) Where he left her!.. 
Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora- tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal". 
INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430 
Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room. 
FILBY But it isn't like George. - To return empty handed.  To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan. (to Mrs. Watchett) He must have taken something with him. 
MRS. WATCHETT Nothing. 
She looks around and discovers three empty spaces on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to them. 
MRS. WATCHETT Nothing except three books. 
FILBY Which three books? 
MRS. WATCHETT I don't know. -- Is it important? 
FILBY (smiles) No, I suppose not. - Only...what three books would you have taken? 
She looks at him, pondering the question as they leave the library.

We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of the house go to bed. 
INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Wesley is getting in bed.  Jacob is sitting in a chair staring out the window.  Wes switches off the lights and turns to Jacob. 
WESLEY Aren't you going to bed? 
JACOB I'm not tired. 
WESLEY Bullshit.  If you looked any more tired, you'd be dead. 
Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness. 
JACOB That's right. 
WESLEY You gotta sleep, man. 
JACOB Why?  Who says?  You know, people don't even really know why we sleep.  They haven't found any physical reason for it. 
WESLEY But they do know that you go nuts if you don't. 
JACOB Sharks don't sleep.  They can't pump water through their gills on their own. They have to always keep moving.  If they stop, they can't breath.  If they go to sleep, they die. 
WESLEY You're not a shark. 
JACOB I know.  I'm just a kid.  Don't worry about me, Wes.  Go to sleep. 
Wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers.  Jacob continues to stare out the window, desperately trying to keep his eyes open. 
JACOB'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW 
the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside.  There is a pause.  Then we are suddenly PULLED THROUGH THE WINDOW, SMASHING glass, careening back into: 
DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD 
We SAIL through the gloomy air, over the creepy buildings. And suddenly DIP DOWN, right for the street, and end up CRUISING three inches off the asphalt, really ripping down the road until we grind to a SUDDEN HALT.  Right in front of: 
FREDDY'S FEET.  Our shot TILTS UP.  Freddy looms above us and grins. 
FREDDY You can't stay awake forever, boy! 
He LAUGHS, his mouth gaping wide, and then splitting open impossibly wider.  Something starts pouring out of his mouth, right at us. 
Hundreds of GIANT BUGS spew down upon us, covering us completely as everything goes to BLACK and we: 
INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ON JACOB 
his eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM. It looks like his head is about to explode.  He lifts his hand up to his face.  He's holding an eight-inch long MONSTER BUG. 
Jacob SCREAMS out loud this time, tosses the mutant insect away.  It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening. 
Jacob jumps to his feet, sending his chair tumbling backwards with a CRASH.  He shakes and moans, a little drool dripping down his chin. 
Wesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob. 
WESLEY I told you you'd go nuts! 
Jacob catches his breath, gives Wes a dead serious look. 
JACOB Get everybody else.  I have to tell them something. 
WESLEY In the middle of the night? 
JACOB I MEAN it! 
Wesley is shocked by Jacob's manic state and jumps out of bed. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT 
Five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief.  Jacob paces back and forth. 
SCOTT I don't get it.  Is this guy alive or dead? 
JACOB He's neither.  He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real. 
Wesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared. 
WESLEY I haven't dreamed of him. I have nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but never of this guy.

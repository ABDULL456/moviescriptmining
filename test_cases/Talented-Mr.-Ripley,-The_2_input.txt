MARGE I don't know her. (to Ripley) He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people. 
The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return. 
PETER Will we see you later? 
RIPLEY I can't later. 
PETER And tomorrow? 
RIPLEY Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? 
PETER I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? 
RIPLEY Ten thirty? 
PETER We'll be there. 
RIPLEY Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. (to Peter) It's really good to meet you. 
INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT. 
Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her. 
RIPLEY Let's go. 
MEREDITH I thought you were enjoying yourself? 
RIPLEY Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. 
MEREDITH You're crazy! It's freezing out there. 
He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting dangerously near as they approach their seats. 
RIPLEY C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. 
MEREDITH (quite taken) Okay then, you're crazy. 
EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT. 
Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber. Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge. 
MEREDITH Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. 
RIPLEY You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now - I look at you and I see her face - and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you - I just can't... 
MEREDITH No, I absolutely understand. Of course. 
RIPLEY Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. 
MEREDITH Beating you away. 
EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME. 
They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go inside, then looks at him. 
MEREDITH Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too...you should always save pain for daylight... 
RIPLEY Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. 
MEREDITH (fluttering) I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps? 
RIPLEY Exactly. 10.30 - (instantly correcting himself)

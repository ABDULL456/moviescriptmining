They embrace. 
SEAN No. Thank you. 
WILL (re: embrace) Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? 
SEAN Only if you grab my ass. 
They laugh. 
WILL See ya. 
SEAN Good luck. 
Both men smile. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up. 
LAMBEAU (surprised) Will. 
WILL Hey, how you doin'? 
LAMBEAU You know, you're no longer required to come here. 
WILL I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean. 
LAMBEAU (a beat) Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week. 
Will nods. 
LAMBEAU Well, that's, I think that's terrific. Congratulations. 
WILL Thank you. 
LAMBEAU I just want you to know... It's been a pleasure. 
WILL Bullshit. 
They laugh. 
LAMBEAU This job... Do it if it's what you really want. 
WILL I appreciate that. 
A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, Will turns back around. 
WILL Hey, Gerry. 
LAMBEAU Yes. 
WILL Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. 
LAMBEAU (has to smile) Thank you, Will. I'll do that. 
Will smiles, turns and walks away. 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Sean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door. 
LAMBEAU Hello, Sean. 
SEAN Come in. 
LAMBEAU Sean... 
SEAN (a beat) Me too. 
A moment. 
LAMBEAU So I hear you're taking some time. 
SEAN Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. 
LAMBEAU Where're you going? 
SEAN I don't know. India maybe. 
LAMBEAU Why there? 
SEAN Never been. 
Lambeau nods. 
LAMBEAU Do you know when you'll be back? 
SEAN (picks up a flyer from his desk) I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months. 
LAMBEAU I got one of those too.

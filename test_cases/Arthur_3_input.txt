ERICA Don't worry, Thomas. This whole thing's just a joke to Arthur. 
Hobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen. 
ARTHUR (VERY AFFECTIONATE) Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to me. 
Vivienne, irritated, hands Hobson a coffee cup. 
VIVIENNE Take this away. (TO ERICA) Progress on the reception? 
ERICA Black inked at the Emery Roth Room at the Ritz-Carlton. 
The screen lights up with a church graphic. 
ERICA (CONT'D) A first pass at the guest list. Bride's family and friends: 
A 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop. In the mock up, the bride's side of the aisle fills with hundreds of computerised guests, many labelled with famous names. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Groom's family and friends: 
About a fifth of that number pop up on Arthur's side. 
ERICA (CONT'D) We can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests, Arthur. To make it seem less desperate. 
Arthur groans and leans over a bowl. 
ARTHUR Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7.6 on the Richter..the Sickter... 
Arthur's sick. Erica lays out more sheets. 
ERICA Cakes, caterers, floral arrangements, photographer... 
Hobson reappears, wipes his mouth and takes the bowl. She stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to Vivienne's nose. 
HOBSON Will there be anything else, sir? 
ARTHUR No, thanks. 
HOBSON (TO VIVIENNE) Ma'am? 
VIVIENNE No. You can leave. 
ARTHUR Why all this crap now? What's the rush anyway? 
BURT The wedding is in a month, Arthur. 
ARTHUR A month? I was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years. Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day. 
Arthur gets up. 
ERICA Where are you going? 
ARTHUR (gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY 
Arthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in daylight. He stops. 
ARTHUR Here we are. 
NAOMI We're not going to end up in the Hudson again, are we? 
ARTHUR I can promise you won't get wet. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT 
The Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT 
Arthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street. He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose. 
NAOMI Are you okay? 
ARTHUR Yeah, fine. Actually... 
But Naomi sees something on the other side of the road. 
Arthur gets a a text from Hobson: `TELL her!'

ROLAND Oh, no. 
IN SARAH'S TENT, 
Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them, swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap. 
As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side, we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's right -- it's blood. 
The baby T-rex's blood. 
AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire that's been lit by DR. BURKE. 
He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan. 
Roland and Ajay run up behind him. 
ROLAND (hisses) ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire. 
BMBB! 
Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that? 
IN SARAH'S TENT, 
Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too. 
BMBB! 
AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
ROLAND Get my weapon. 
Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold, staring down at the ground. 
BMBB! 
A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric circles spreading to the outer edges. 
BMBB! 
IN SARAH'S TENT, 
Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food into Ziploc bags. 
BMBB! 
Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves, and draw the zipper up, all the way around. 
Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent. Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last few inches, but -- 
-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the tent. 
It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously. 
In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag, trying to figure out what this thing is. 
It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and then rises, straights up -- 
-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground beneath it. 
IN THE CAMPSITE, 
the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake up.  Many of them start to run. 
Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep into the mud. 
Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked Hunters flee in all directions. 
ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes. 
ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into the jungle. 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group. 
MALCOLM KELLY?  KEEEEELLLY?! 
But he can't see her. 
AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a narrow ravine. 
UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

Lousy at his job. \nIn the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the United States National Science Foundation to gather data concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent of Antarctica. \nTHE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31 \nThe interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated materials have been used in its construction. \nThere is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles are for storage and supplies. \nThe most spacious area of the building, and the main center of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment. \nThe below quarter houses the generator and still other compartments for storage. \nA long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the dog kennel. \nFADE IN: \nA STARRY BLACKNESS \nFrom out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging into the screen. \n\"THE THING\" \nA thundering... \nFADE TO: \nBLIND AND FERAL WHITENESS \n...Glacial desert... gusts of snow... superimpose: \nANTARCTICA 1982 WINTER \nA SOUND \nLoud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered and swayed by the wind. \nINT. COPTER \nRed dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men arguing like mad and desperate children. \nThe man with the binoculars sights something. \nEXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG \nIt turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks up snow at its heels. \nINT. COPTER \nAnother blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine is put into full throttle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BURNING COPTER \nSeveral men spray snow on the burning wreckage. There is no hope for the pilot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMPOUND \nCLOSE ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN INTRUDER \nA neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead. \nStation manager Garry holds up something akin to an ID. \nGARRY Norwegian... Jans Bolen. \nFuchs, a young and sensitive-looking biologist, stands closest to the large area map of Antarctica. Several men sit and stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought- together card-tables. \nFUCHS Gotta be from the Norwegian camp. \nGARRY How far's that? \nFUCHS 'Bout eighty kilos southwest. \nGARRY (surprised) That far? \nGarry directs his attention to Childs, the large black man who had been working on the snowmobile. Next to him sits Norris, the rugged-looking, fortyish, geophysicist, who was one of the men being shot at. \nGARRY You catch anything he was saying? \nCHILDS Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana? \nGarry motions inquiringly to Norris. \nNORRIS Yeah. I caught that he wanted the better part of my ass to come apart. \nINT. INFIRMARY \nDr. Cooper, mid-forties, works on the outstretched leg of Bennings, the meteorologist. Clark, the dog handler, is mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner. \nBennings lets out with an ouch. \nDR. COPPER Don't \"ouch\" me. Two stitches. It just grazed you. \nHe helps a shaken Bennings up off the table. \nBENNINGS What in the hell were they doing...? Flying that low... shooting at a dog... at us... \nDR. COPPER Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows. \nThe dog yelps and whimpers as Clark tries to calm him. \nCLARK I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty deep. \nINT. RADIO ROOM \nBlair, senior biologist, fifty, balding, leans against the entrance door. \nHe looks on as the young, bored-looking radio operator, Sanchez, attends to his equipment. Bursts of static. \nSANCHEZ It's no go. \nBLAIR Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've got to report this mess. \nSANCHEZ Look, I haven't been able to reach shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's talked to anybody on the whole continent. \nINT. HALLWAY \nNauls, the cook, glides along on his roller stakes down one of the many narrow hallways that connect the various compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little mischievous, about twenty-two. \nHe comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the dead Norwegian. \nNAULS Maybe we at war with Norway. \nPalmer, a spacy, twenty-seven year old, novice pilot and mechanic, grins as he lights a joint. He directs a remark to station manager Garry. \nPALMER Was wondering when \"El Capitan\" was going to get a chance to use his pop gun. \nGarry rebukes him with a stern look and then turns to Fuchs. \nGARRY How long have they been stationed there? \nFuchs leafing through a pile of papers. \nFUCHS Says here about eight weeks. \nDr. Copper enters the room. Bennings limping after him slightly. \nGARRY (shaking his head) That's not enough time for guys to go bonkers. \nGarry, Bennings, Dr. Copper, Palmer and MacReady wind their way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper. Dr. Copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies. MacReady, going over his flight chart, looks mad as hell. Dialogue overlaps. \nMACREADY ...Craziness... This is goddamn insane... \nGARRY ...Quit the griping MacReady. Sooner you're there -- sooner you're back. \nMACREADY It's against regulations to go up this time of year! \nDR. COPPER Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there! \nMACREADY So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down. \nGARRY Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up... \nMACREADY What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers! \nPALMER (defiant) Four! \nMACREADY (to Bennings) What is it out there, anyway? Forty- five knots? \nBENNINGS Sixteen. \nMACREADY (disgusted) And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year... \nINT./ EXT. CHOPPER \nDr. Copper sits next to MacReady, who is at the controls. \nMacReady tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck and starts up its choking engine. \nMacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles to get the craft into the air. It finally rights itself and moves up and off into the grey-white sky. \nINT. MAIN COMPOUND \nA couple of the men mingle in the area. Clark, the dog handler, looks out the window. \nCLARK Mac's really taking it up, huh? \nThe dog, a large bandage on his hip, wades through the room. Under tables. Past men's legs. It hobbles slightly. No one takes notice. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CHOPPER \nmoves over a ridge of ice. Columns of smoke can be seen rising ominously from a quarter mile off. \nINT. CHOPPER - POINT OF VIEW \nAs they near, the smoke looms thicker. A black, tar-like gush; billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below. \nEXT. NORWEGIAN CAMP \nSmoke climbs upward in the f.g. MacReady sets his craft down. Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians. \nSmall fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers swirl in every direction. \nINT. CHOPPER \nThe two men look at each other in silence. They get out. \nCLOSE ON A LARGE, MAKESHIFT FUNERAL PYRE \nsmoldering to a close. A hastily conceived crematorium. Wood, books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and the body of a man. \nCurious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within the mess. \nA small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not far off. \nMACREADY AND COPPER \ntheir faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight. \nMacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then exchanges a look with Copper. MacReady heads back toward the chopper. \nTHE CHOPPER \nMacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel behind the seats. \nEXT. THE MAIN BUILDING - THE DOOR \nMacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of snow and embers. MacReady tries the door. It is unlocked. He slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch- black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight. \nDR. COPPER Anybody there?! \nNo answer. Just wind. They exchange a look and enter. \nINT. NARROW CORRIDOR \nThe two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead. The flashlight is not much help. \nFurther down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from within. \nMACREADY Portable video unit. \nCopper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles through papers, glancing at the writing. \nMACREADY Anything? \nDR. COPPER All in Norwegian. \nDr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn about the room. \nMACREADY What are you doing? \nDR. COPPER Could be important work. Might as well bring it back. \nMACREADY It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms. \nHe exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMacReady shoves himself into another room. \nINT. ROOM \nDebris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and shines the light upwards. \nThe ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper into the room. \nINT. NORWEGIAN LAB \nDr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast forwards. The same casual drone. \nMACREADY (O.S.) Copper, come here!! \nINT. ROOM \nDr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down. \nMACREADY Careful. It's about to go. \nCopper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall. \nIt has partially melted, but its thawing process has been stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost. \nIts one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. The two men study it uncomprehendingly. \nMacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and play. \nHe tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of dust float down. \nDR. COPPER Watch it. \nHis grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The large metal door flies open. \nLarge chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear. \nHis flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door. \nIt is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque. \nMacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door. \nAn armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go crashing to the floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM \nThe loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, \"The Werewolves of London,\" can be heard throughout the compound. The room is empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its bandage on, walks by. \nINT. KITCHEN \nZevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot to pan keeping time with his sounds. \nHe smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch there. He clearly enjoys his work. \nStation Manager Garry stops past the open door. \nGARRY Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can hear it all over the camp! \nNAULS Oui, Bwana. Can do. \nHe skates over and turns it down, but not much. \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM \nGarry enters and sees that Sanchez has nodded off in front of his receiver. His headgear is still on. Garry walks over and turns up the volume, the static jolting Sanchez awake. \nSANCHEZ Hey, man...! \nGARRY You reach anybody yet? \nBewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something: a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring growl. \nThe new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling. \nEmitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them into a frenzy. \nBarks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. Three dogs start to close in on the stranger. \nThey attack. \nTHE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG \nagainst the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, seeming larger. \nThe kennel roars. \nINT. PUB \nMacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs. \nINT. NAULS' QUARTERS \nHe, too, bothered by the noise, tosses and turns in his sleep. \nINT. CLARK'S QUARTERS \nClark snores. MacReady has entered. \nMACREADY Clark. \nNo response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed. \nMacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air. \nClark sits up, groggy. \nMACREADY Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of it. \nINT. TUNNEL \nClark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead. \nCLARK \nreaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door. \nCLARK What's got into... \nSmack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. And a screeching from within. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far- off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints. \nHIS BEER CAN \nas it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever. \nINT. TUNNEL \nThe alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark. \nMacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his .44. Clark, a fire ax. \nCLARK I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is. \nINT. HALLWAY \nChaos. Men, half-naked, bounce from their cubicle. \nPulling on their pants, digging into shoes. \nINT. CHILDS' CUBICLE \nChilds is grappling with his belt buckle. \nCHILDS Mac wants the what?! \nBENNINGS (at the doorway) That's what he said. Now! Move! \nBennings is off. \nINT. TUNNEL \nas the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied. \nThe fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady enter the kennel. \nThe light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; the men; the screeching; the blackness. \nCLARK Mac, where are you? \nINT. INFIRMARY \nFuchs is attending to the shredded bodies of three other badly wounded dogs. \nINT. REC ROOM \nNauls pats Clark on the shoulder and grins, trying to pick up his spirits. \nNAULS It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's over. (beat) You see. \nClark turns to him with a childlike smile. \nCLARK I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw. \nNAULS Right, man. Right. \nINT. SMALL WORKROOM \nNorris is going through some maps. MacReady is bent over his shoulder. Norris finds the one he's looking for. \nNORRIS Here. This is where they were spending most of their time. \nBennings pokes his head in the room. \nBENNINGS Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five knots. \nMACREADY Screw it, I'm going up anyway. \nINT. MAIN COMPOUND - MORNING \nStation Manager Garry has joined Blair by the stuck-together bodies. Blair motions to the bandage. \nBLAIR Was that dog, the Norwegian dog? \nGARRY I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog. \nCHILDS (evenly) \"tweren't no dog, Bwana. \nBLAIR That tape MacReady showed us this morning... \nGARRY Couldn't make much of it myself. \nBLAIR I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you? \nGARRY Sure. You think there's a connection? \nBLAIR Maybe. \nEXT. CHOPPER \nhigh above the Antarctic expanse. \nINT. CHOPPER \nMacReady pilots. Young Palmer and Norris are with him. \nIt is clear but the winds are troublesome. The ride is a shaky one. Norris refers to their map. He points. \nNORRIS One of their sites would be directly over here. \nThey aim for a large mountainous wall. As they go up and over... they see: \nFLAT, GLACIAL EXPANSE \nOn the surface, an enormous blackened oval shape. \nINT. U.S. OUTPOST #31 - LAB \nAll the bodies of the dogs have been brought in. Fuchs stands by as Blair studies through his microscope. \nINSERT - A MICROSCOPIC SAMPLING \nof two cells. They appear to be much different from each other. They are joined at the ends but are completing the process of breaking off from each other. \nON BLAIR \nA disturbed look on his face. He checks his watch, as if timing the procedure. \nEXT. GLACIER - TRACKING WITH MACREADY, NORRIS AND PALMER \nas they walk along the ice. They come to a stop at the edge of a sharp drop. \nPull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere. \nMacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence. \nPalmer is in awe. \nPALMER Wow... \nMacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb down. \nNAULS I want my kitchen clean. Germ free! \nNauls spins on his skates and storms off. MacReady fetches the strangely shredded underwear and rolls it up, while Childs paces. \nCHILDS So, MacReady, come on now. These Norwegian dudes come by... find him and dig him up... \nMacReady tosses the ball of cloth across the room into a trash bin. \nMACREADY Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl... \nCHILDS Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh? \nMACREADY (annoyed) I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair. \nCHILDS You buy any of this, Blair? \nA beat as Blair stares straight ahead, transfixed. He speaks softly, to no one particular. \nBLAIR It was here... got to that dog... It was here in this camp... \nThe men take in his grave countenance. \nGARRY So...? So what? It's over with. \nBlair turns to them. A pause. The men search his face. \nBENNINGS (edgy) Well, isn't it? \nINT. LAB - CLOSE ON A SHEET \nas Blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking dogs. \nPull back. All the men have gathered. Some of the men settle into chairs, others stand. \nBLAIR Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form... (indicates their dog) ...when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly... (holds up gooey dog leg) ...This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or... \nNAULS Finish what? \nBLAIR ...I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form. \nPALMER Well, that Thing in the ice sure weren't no dog. \nBLAIR (impatient) Of course not... But whatever it was revived, it... Well, The Thing was probably disoriented... and realized it couldn't survive for long in our atmosphere... But being the incredibly adaptable creature it was... it tried to become something that could... Before the Norwegians killed it... it somehow got to this dog. \nCLARK What do you mean \"got\" to the dog? \nBLAIR It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell. \nSilence. \nBLAIR The concept is staggering. I know... I... I don't fully understand it myself. \nCHILDS (skeptically, points) You're saying... that big muther in the ice, became the dog. \nBLAIR (nodding) I think we're talking about an organism... that could imitate other life forms... perfectly... It could have gone on and on... It could have become one dog... It could have become as many dogs as it wanted to -- and without losing any of its original mass... \nNORRIS You been into Childs' weed, Blair? \nBlair slams his fist on the slab. \nBLAIR Look, I know it's hard to believe... \nGARRY (breaking in) So what's our problem? \nBLAIR Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet. \nSeveral of the men nearest the carcasses jump back knocking over a chair. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE DOG CARCASSES \nlying on the snow. Splash. They are being soaked with gasoline. \nFUCHS (O.S.) (in violent protestation) You can't do this! You can't burn these remains... \nPull back. Fuchs is beside himself. Childs has the large torch. MacReady empties another can on the bodies. Dr. Copper stands nearby. \nMACREADY And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs. (to Childs) Light it up. \nChilds lights the tip. Fuchs makes a determined move for the torch. \nFUCHS Well, I'm not going to let this happen... \nChilds struggles with him for a beat and then flings him to the ground. Dr. Copper grabs him preventing him from getting back up. \nChilds splays the remains with a jet of flame. Fuchs shakes his head in frustration and disgust. \nFUCHS I just can't believe it... We're going to go down as the biggest bunch of assholes in history... \nMACREADY Fuck history. At least we're going to live to be an old bunch of assholes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT \nPitch black except for the barest of lighting which outlines the building. Wind. The swirl of ice. \nINT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT \nFar away from the others, MacReady sits in his little hovel putting the final screw into his mended chess set. \nOn the other side of the set, his busty, inflatable companion has been propped up in a chair. His sombrero hangs down her back, keeping her in place. Hawaiian music plays from his tape deck. \nMACREADY All set. \nHe puts down his screwdriver, holds up his glass and offers a toast with a big grin. \nMACREADY To us. \nHe clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her side of the board. He sips. He turns on the machine and makes his first move. \nMACREADY Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm just a beginner. \nThe set answers for Esperanza. \nCHESS VOICE Rook takes bishop at Queen four -- Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate. \nMACREADY Aw shit. \nHe flips open the circuitry panel in disgust. He tosses his screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink, downing it. \nMACREADY Sorry, hon. \nHe reaches inside his ice bucket. Empty. \nMACREADY Never any damn ice around here... \nEXT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT \nMacReady exits. He swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a small ice pick. \nMACREADY Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got ice... They got ice coming out of their ears. \nThe sound of a clanking. He turns his attention. Metal against metal. Strange. MacReady listens. It appears to be coming from far off below, near the camp. \nMACREADY \nas he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. The clanking louder now. He senses the direction. \nMACREADY \nat the bottom near the main compound.  The sound has stopped. He looks around in the near blackness.  A beat. \nTHE CHOPPERS \nsitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to one of the cockpits is slightly ajar. He opens it cautiously. \nINT. CHOPPER \nMacReady slips in. He turns on a flashlight. The controls have been mangled. Beaten with something heavy. Bang!! MacReady, startled, turns. Like the sound of a gun. Coming from the main compound. \nINT. COMPOUND - MAIN ENTRANCE \nConfusion. Shouts. MacReady enters. He grabs Palmer as he and Bennings rush by. \nMACREADY What's... \nPALMER Blair. He's gone berserk. \nBENNINGS He's in the radio room. Got a gun. Beat on Sanchez something fierce. \nHALLWAY - RADIO ROOM ENTRANCE \nThe men are on either side of the open radio room doorway. \nGarry peeks his head in. A gunshot blast forces him back. \nRADIO ROOM \nSanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on the door. He wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes down on the radio. \nBLAIR Anybody interferes, I'll kill! Nobody's getting in or out of this camp... \nHALLWAY \nMacReady has joined the others. \nMACREADY He smashed one of the choppers up good. Childs, go check the other one and the tractor. \nChilds is off. \nRADIO ROOM \nEXT. COMPOUND - DAY \nHarsh and grey. Getting very dark as winter takes a stronger hold. Bennings is dumping the trash in a large hole in the snow which acts as the trash dump. \nBennings finishes and drags the empty bins past Palmer and Childs, who are fixing the wounded choppers. \nINT. RADIO ROOM \nThe radio looks a mess. Norris and Sanchez, a bandage wrapped around his head, examines the damage. He is in pain and still looks a little groggy. \nSANCHEZ I'll see what I can do. But they didn't teach me much about fixing these things. \nNorris smiles and pats him comfortingly. \nNORRIS They didn't teach you much about working them either. \nINT. MESS HALL - MORNING \nCLOSE ON A BUFFET OF EGGS, BACON, TOAST, ETC. \nPull back. The men help themselves. It is a cramped, elongated room. \nDr. Copper approaches Nauls and hands him a capsule. \nDR. COPPER Put this in Blair's juice before you take him his tray. \nClark comes running into the room, pallid, out of breath. The men turn to look. \nCLARK The dogs... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE KENNEL \nEmpty. Clark and Garry examine the latch of the kennel door. \nGARRY Doesn't look broken. \nCLARK No. Door was wide open. I know I latched it. \nEXT. COMPOUND ABOVE THE UNDERGROUND KENNEL \nCLOSE ON THE DOGS' TRACKS in the snow. They lead from the kennel's open stairwell and out onto the ice. All the men have gathered. \nCLARK All three of them took off. \nMacReady is writing down what appears to be a list on a pad. \nDR. COPPER How long do you suppose they've been gone? \nCLARK I haven't seen them since their last feeding. Could be as much as twenty- four hours. \nMACREADY They couldn't have gotten that far in this weather. \nGarry and several others turn to MacReady quizzically. \nGARRY You're not thinking of going after them, are you? \nMACREADY I am going after them. \nNORRIS What in the hell for? Even if Blair's right -- they'll just die out there. No food. They're over a thousand miles from anything. \nPALMER Chopper aren't going to be ready for days. \nMacReady hands his list to Bennings. \nMACREADY Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles. \nGARRY You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got. \nMACREADY Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on? \nPALMER (grins) Oh, I got you. Not too long. \nMACREADY Then get a move on. Childs, come with me. \nHe puts his arm around Childs and pulls him along. The others watch them walk off, a little bewildered. \nGARRY (shouting after them) Besides, what are you going to do when you catch up to them? \nBennings is reading MacReady's list. \nBENNINGS Holy shit. (hands list to Garry) Whatever he's going to do, he ain't fucking around. \nEXT. OUTDOOR WORK AREA - CLOSE ON THE BARREL \nof the large torch. A fierce stream of flame bursts from its nozzle. \nPull back. The stream has shot out some fifteen feet. \nChilds has been modifying it. \nIt sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass. \nThe men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point. \nChilds, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles. \nChilds and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food. \nCHILDS Where's the other one? \nBennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle them with his flashlight. \nMACREADY (to dog) Where's your buddy, boy? Huh? \nNo response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his light. All three are growing uneasy. \nMACREADY Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't let up until he's ash. \nChilds turns on the gas and lights the tip. \nBennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice. \nChilds and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him. \nMacReady stumbles. \nThe sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear. \nHe freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It snarls; its face turns slowly toward him. \nIts skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly. \nMACREADY Childs!! \nChilds stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible jump of some twenty feet. \nChilds lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice in flames. \nMacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and engulfs the screeching animal in fire. \nBENNINGS \nhowling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help. \nMACREADY (pulls him back) Stay back!! \nBennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a different area and is just as quickly pulled back down. \nMacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger. \nCHILDS What we going to do?! \nMACREADY How the fuck do I know?! \nBennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls seem to be absorbing his head. \nMacReady runs for the snowmobile. \nMACREADY Torch them!! \nCHILDS But... \nMACREADY He's gone already! Do it! \nChilds blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and whatever has him catch fire. A screeching. \nMacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps cans of gasoline on the writhing mess. \nHe dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage. \nHe and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them. \nThey look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to subside. \nTHE SUN \nIts slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMPOUND - REC ROOM \nThe men are interrogating Clark. He is frazzled and defensive. \nCLARK ...I'm telling you I don't remember leaving the kennel unlatched... \nChilds is holding the industrial torch directly in his face. \nCHILDS Bullshit! You left it open so they could get out! \nEXT. TRASH DUMP \nDR. COPPER (O.S.) Garry. The rest of you! Come here! \nINT. INFIRMARY \nThe men rush in. Fuchs and Copper stand by the open plasma storage refrigerator. The inside is a mess of dried blood. The bladders have been ripped open. Copper is ghastly pale. \nDR. COPPER Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged it. \nNAULS Oh, my God. \nA horrified silence. \nMACREADY Was it broken into? \nFUCHS No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. And then locked it. \nSanchez twitches, terrified. \nMACREADY Well, who's got access to it? \nDR. COPPER I guess I'm the only one. \nGARRY And I've got the only key. \nSeveral pairs of eyes turn to Garry. \nMACREADY Would that test have worked? \nDR. COPPER I think so. \nNORRIS Somebody else sure as hell thought so. \nMACREADY Who else could have used that key? \nGARRY Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it... \nMACREADY Could anyone have gotten it from you? \nDR. COPPER I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away. \nNORRIS When was the last time you used it? \nDR. COPPER (uneasy) A day or so ago... I guess. \nGarry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him. \nGARRY I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But... \nCHILDS That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? \nGARRY (upset, flustered) Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator. \nSilence as the men continue to stare. Sanchez is perspiring. \nGARRY Copper's the only one who has any business with it. \nThe eyes shift from Garry to Copper. \nDR. COPPER Now... wait a second, Garry, you've been in here on several occasions... \nFUCHS And the Doc thought of the test. \nCHILDS (anger) So what?! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! Bullshit! \nSanchez bolts out the door. Stunned for a beat, the others chase after him. \nGARRY Hey, Sanchez! \nSANCHEZ \nin terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors. \nOpening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit. \nThey shout for him to stop. \nCUT TO: \nSANCHEZ \nas he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. Locked. \nHe hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous. \nThe others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his handgun and points. \nGARRY Put that down! \nSANCHEZ (trembling) No. \nGARRY I'll put this right through your head. \nCHILDS No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job. \nEXT. COMPOUND \nMacReady and Sanchez are foraging through the trash dump. \nMACREADY Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth. \nINT. RADIO ROOM \nNorris has begun dismantling the radio. He rubs at his chest as he disengages the headset. \nINT. HALLWAY \nFollowing Nauls as he skates through the labyrinth. \nChecking waste bins. Pausing to look behind shelves and any obscure hiding place. \nMacReady passes him coming the other way. \nNAULS That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady. \nMACREADY Just keep looking. \nINT. LAB \nFuchs is poring over a book. Several others lie open on his desk. \nMacReady pokes his head in the lab. \nMACREADY How's it going? \nFUCHS Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've been thinking... If our dogs changed by swallowing parts of that other one... We better see to it that everyone prepares their own food and we eat out of cans. \nMACREADY Gotchya. \nEXT. COMPOUND \nA siren goes off, signaling the end of a twenty-minute period. Sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump. \nPalmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward the compound. \nINT. COMPOUND \nThe hallway near the supply storage cubicle. MacReady holds the door open as Palmer makes his way to him lugging the heavy helicopter part. \nChilds passes by from the other direction. \nPALMER Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One? \nCHILDS Ain't it there? \nHe passes by. \nPALMER No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there? \nMACREADY Move it, Palmer. \nINT. SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM \nPalmer sets down the heavy part. Norris follows him inside with a bundle of radio gear. They move back out into the hallway. MacReady locks the door behind them. \nHALLWAY \nThe three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous at the rec room. \nMACREADY (to Palmer) Start taking apart those snowmobiles next, huh? \nINT. KITCHEN \nCramped. Several of the men are preparing their food. \nOpening cans. Heating them in pots. \nEXT. COMPOUND \nNauls wearily approaches Blair's tool shed with a tray of food. He hears a pounding from within. \nNAULS I got your goodies, superdude. \nHe peeks in through the opening in the boarded-up window. \nBlair is nailing himself in from the inside. He looks pretty crazed. \nNAULS What you doin'? \nBLAIR Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that! \nNAULS Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you? \nNauls slides the tray in the slot. It is immediately shoved back out and topples onto the ice. Some of the food has splashed on Nauls' heavy coat. \nMACREADY (to Palmer) Well, let's get down there. \nCHILDS (O.S.) MacReady! \nMACREADY What? \nCHILDS (O.S.) Garry's missing! \nMACREADY (to self) Oh, shit! (shouts) Well, hang on! \nCHILDS (O.S.) Gee, thanks! \nINT. GENERATOR ROOM \nPalmer and MacReady stumbling down the stairs. MacReady turns around, looks. \nMACREADY Where's Sanchez? \nBoth look around. Sanchez is gone. Palmer's light finds the motionless generator. He examines it. \nPALMER The fuel pump... it's gone... (frantic) You've got to get up to supply, Mca. If we don't get this thing started soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll never get it going. \nMacReady dashes upstairs into the darkness. \nINT. HALLWAY \nThe lab door is opened. Fuchs holding a small candle walks out. As he passes, the shoulder of a man springs into frame. \nINT. GENERATOR ROOM \nPalmer is feverishly working underneath the generator on his back. \nINT. REC ROOM \nThe temperature continues to drop rapidly. Childs swats himself to keep warm, while still keeping an eye on Dr. Copper and the rest of the room. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMacReady rushes out of the supply room, with a fuel pump, bumps into somebody. \nMACREADY Who... Who is that? \nThe silhouette moves on down the hallway. \nMACREADY Sanchez...?  Hey, who... \nPALMER (O.S.) Mac, where the hell is that pump!! \nCUT TO: \nINT. GENERATOR ROOM \nMacReady holds the flashlight for Palmer. Their breath, puffs of white smoke. \nPALMER Somebody definitely messed with it. \nMACREADY We going to make it? \nPALMER Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is... \nThe sound of a screeching. From somewhere in the compound. The two men's faces, locked in fear. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REC ROOM \nThe generator has been repaired; the lights within the compound are back on. \nGrim and tense. Everyone is present but Fuchs. Eyes flit from man to man. Palmer, Nauls and Sanchez are spread out about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from the rest. \nNorris and Childs are tying the Doctor, Clark and Garry to the couch. MacReady prepares several makeshift blowtorches as he kneels on the ground. \nSANCHEZ Where were the flashlights? \nMACREADY Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you? \nPALMER Tons of stuff's been missing around here. Magnetos, cables, wire... \nNAULS Kitchen things, too... \nMACREADY Anybody see Fuchs... or hear him...? Huh? \nNo answer as the men's faces roam the room. Childs glares at Garry as he begins to tie him in. \nCHILDS Where'd you go? \nGarry's groggy features stare blankly. \nCHILDS I said where? Where'd you go?! \nGARRY Was dark... find a light... \nBLAIR I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here. \nMACREADY Have you come across Fuchs? \nBLAIR Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise... \nMACREADY We'll see... \nHe and Nauls trudges off. Blair shouts after them. \nBLAIR I promise! I'm much better now! I'll be good!! I'm all better!! Don't leave me here!! \nINT. REC ROOM \nNorris continues his watch on the sedated trio. He anxiously tries to keep an eye on the various entrances behind and in front of him. He rubs his chest in pain. \nDR. COPPER I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup. \nNORRIS Let's just not get worried about anything just now. \nDR. COPPER (yawning) After all this mess then. \nNORRIS (nodding) After all this mess. \nEXT. COMPOUND - THE SLOPE TO MACREADY'S SHACK \nThe winds are thick and vicious now. MacReady and Nauls pull themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. A violent gust sends MacReady's body horizontal, but still hanging onto the rope. The wind slaps him back down. His flare and torch tumble back toward Nauls. \nNauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill. \nMacReady, lying vulnerable, watches Nauls pull his way toward him. He tenses. Nauls reaches him. A beat. He hands back his torch. Relieved, MacReady pulls himself upright. \nINT. COMPOUND - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON THICK POWER CABLES \nthat line the wall. They have been torn apart. Childs and Palmer examine. \nPALMER Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut. \nCHILDS Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart. \nEXT. MACREADY'S SHACK \nas they reach the top. The remaining flare their only light. Very dark. They stand on either side of the door. MacReady shoves it open. Pitch black inside. MacReady flips the light switch. Doesn't work. \nINT. SHACK \nThey enter. Hunched. Torches ready. The place is a mess. The winds as strong as on the outside. \nThe single flare illuminating the ceiling. Almost all of the corrugated, steel roofing is gone. As if ripped off. \nNAULS (shouting to be heard) Where's the roof?! \nMacReady stares up incredulous, as they advance through the room. \nNAULS This storm do that? \nMACREADY (shouting) Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half... \nNauls kicks over a chair. A naked, fleshy object bounds high into the air. Nauls thrusts out his torch, catching the breasts of the inflatable woman. She pops and is sucked out through the hole in the roof. \nNauls tries to catch his breath. \nNAULS Goddamn white women. \nINT. COMPOUND \nUnderground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants. \nOne by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. Nervous. \nChilds pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind push them back. They wedge their bodies at the entrance to the lightless room. \nCHILDS My babies. \nThey enter. The light from the hall exposes the completely smashed-in window high above the plants. The plants look frozen. \nPALMER Somebody broke in. \nCHILDS Now who'd go and do... \nSaddened, angry, Childs goes to check the damage to his plants. Palmer, his face set in horror, yanks him back. \nPALMER Childs!! \nCHILDS Let go of me... \nPALMER Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything... \nCHILDS What's it going to do, being a plant? \nPalmer readies his small torch. \nThe others surround him. \nPALMER Where's MacReady? \nNauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down underneath his heavy jacket. \nNAULS Cut him loose of the line up by his shack. \nCHILDS Cut him loose? \nNAULS When we were up poking around his place... I found this... \nHe pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. It is mutilated and partially burned. He holds out the jacket to show the inside collar. \nClose on name tag -- it reads: R.J. MACREADY The men, as they examine in a hush. \nNAULS ...It was stashed in his old coal furnace... wind must have dislodged it... I don't think he saw me find it. \nThe men continue to examine in various states of disbelief. \nNAULS ...Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose. \nSANCHEZ (incredulous) MacReady...? \nNAULS He's one of them. \nSANCHEZ (scared) When do you think it got to him? \nPALMER Could have been anytime. Anywhere. \nCHILDS (to Nauls, suspicious) If it did get to him. \nNAULS Look, man... \nPALMER When the lights went out... \nNORRIS Would have been a perfect time... \nPALMER Right. Garry was missing... (pointedly) ...And Sanchez... \nSANCHEZ (goes for him) Fuck you, Palmer. \nChilds and Norris separate them. \nNORRIS This is just what it wants... to pit us against each other. \nA pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward. \nNauls scampers to his feet. They tense. \nMACREADY (O.S.) Open up! \nNo answer as the men surround the door, their weapons ready. Fear. \nMACREADY (O.S.) ...Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... (still nothing) ...Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here... \nNAULS (harsh whisper) Bullshit! He's got to know damn well I cut it! \nThe men keep their voices low. \nPALMER Let's open it. \nCHILDS Hell no. \nMore pounding. \nSANCHEZ (shaking) You think he's changed into one of those Things? \nNORRIS He hasn't had enough time. \nCHILDS ...Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline... \nMACREADY (O.S.) ...Where is everybody?! I'm half frostbit! \nPALMER Let's open it. Now... \nCHILDS (edgy, hostile) Why you so damn anxious to let him in here... \nPALMER (slightly trembling) He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away. \nCHILDS No. Just let him freeze out there. \nSANCHEZ (voice cracking) What if we're wrong about him? \nCHILDS Then we're wrong. \nThe muffled breaking of a window down the hall. The men turn. \nPALMER The supply window! \nSANCHEZ (terror) What we going to... \nMACREADY So you sweethearts had yourselves a little trial. I just may have to kill you on general principle, Nauls. \nCopper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance. \nMACREADY ...Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up... \nCHILDS We ain't buying that. \nDR. COPPER Damn it, quit the bickering and give me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator over here. \nSanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. Copper climbs up on the table and straddles Norris' chest. \nUnnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray behind his back. \nDR. COPPER Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face... Childs, grab his shoulders. \nThey do so. Copper holds electrical prongs over Norris' chest. \nCHILDS (to MacReady, threatening) You're going to have to sleep sometime. \nDR. COPPER Quiet down... (to Sanchez) ...turn that thing on. \nSanchez depresses the \"on\" button. \nDR. COPPER Now hold him. \nMACREADY I'm a real light sleeper, Childs... \nDR. COPPER Enough, MacReady! \nDr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask. \nDR. COPPER Again... More current this time, Sanchez... \nBuzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his side. \nMACREADY And if anyone tries to wake me... \nDR. COPPER Damn you, MacReady! \nNorris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth. \nThe men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his chest and flops to the floor. \nSANCHEZ God... what...? \nThey watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab. \nIts clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon. \nMacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off. \nMACREADY Get out of the way!! \nHe unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet. \nA black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped from the walls and put to work. \nMacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, as they twitch and mew on the floor. \nWithin seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris. \nMacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their tiny squeals abating into silence. \nINT. REC ROOM \nMacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite. \nCLARK What you got in mind, MacReady? \nMACREADY A little test. \nPALMER What kind of test? \nMACREADY I'm sure a lot of you already know. \nHe tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to Palmer. \nMACREADY Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight. \nCHILDS What for? \nMACREADY For your health. \nGARRY (to others) Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up. \nMACREADY Damn if I won't. \nCHILDS (a beat) You ain't tying me up. \nMACREADY Then I'll have to kill you. \nNAULS What about Childs? \nMACREADY Forget about Childs. He's over. \nNauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite. \nGARRY Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker if we need to use them. \nThe wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one of the other entrances with a large computer. \nSANCHEZ What if it doesn't come? \nMACREADY It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... (to Sanchez) Give me a hand. \nThey block off a door with two heavy electrical games. \nMACREADY (to Sanchez) You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen. \nNAULS (protest) You crazy? He might be inside already? \nMACREADY Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged. \nNauls starts lacing his skates. \nSANCHEZ He might just wait us out. \nMACREADY I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze. \nMacReady further barricades the door with small couch. \nMACREADY We've got portable heaters -- we'll last longer. \nSanchez and Nauls start to leave. \nMACREADY ...Hold it. \nHe dispenses the capsules. \nMACREADY Sodium cyanide. We place them between our cheeks and gums... This Thing can't imitate anything that's dead. \nA grim silence. \nMACREADY If it gets a hold of you -- bite down... They're supposed to be fast and painless... Now move. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR \nSanchez and Nauls inch their way through. \nINT. REC ROOM \nMacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the door. Popping, sparks, smoke. \nMACREADY Looks good. \nGARRY One thousand volts. Should be enough. \nINT. KITCHEN \nNauls pushes a stove, reinforcing a locked door. Five yards away, Sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another outlet. \nSanchez hears a quiet purring, bubbling sound. He turns to Nauls. \nSANCHEZ You hear that? \nNAULS Hear what? \nA blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top volume. \nINT. REC ROOM \nThe same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices drowned out. \nINT. HALLWAY \nEmpty. Another of the stereo speakers that line the walls, thunders. \nINT. KITCHEN \nNauls, in sudden realization, screams over the din and points back in the direction they came. \nNAULS It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo! \nSANCHEZ What?! \nNAULS It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?! \nSANCHEZ I can't hear you. \nINT. REC ROOM \n", "test1_input": "MACREADY Little ice core drilling... some seismology... glaciology... same old shit we do. \nThe present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably drunk, holding a sign across their waists as they stand outdoors in super-freezing weather. \nBENNINGS How much more of this crap is there? \nDR. COPPER About nine more hours. \nBENNINGS We can't learn anything from this. \nDR. COPPER Probably right. \nMacReady turns on the light and shuts off the video machine. He then slides the portable tape deck across the table to Dr. Copper. They exchange a look. \nDR. COPPER MacReady and I were listening to some of these cassettes on the way back. (somberly) Like you gentlemen to hear it. \nA Norwegian voice drones on calmly, making verbal notes. \nNorris shrugs. \nBENNINGS What do you want from us? \nMACREADY (flat) Just listen. \nDr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden floorboards. A gurgling. A hissing. \nScreams. And then a screeching. More blasts mixed with the din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard. \nThe men look from one another in silence as they listen. \nDr. Copper turns it off. \nDR. COPPER Goes on like that quite awhile. (beat) What do you gentlemen make of it? \nGARRY Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand... \nNORRIS Maybe the whole camp got bent... Something they ate. What about food poisoning, Doc? \nDr. Copper taps the tape deck pensively. \nDR. COPPER Maybe. \nHe glances at MacReady, and then back to the others. \nDR. COPPER There's something else we want you to see. \nINT. INFIRMARY \nDr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of a large plastic trash bag onto the slab. \nDR. COPPER We found this. \nDisplayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush. \nThe head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around the body's left leg. \nThe shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like mess. \nThe men grimace. \nDR. COPPER I know he's pretty badly burned... but could fire have done this? \nBlair, sickened but fascinated, pokes at the tendon-like things and the tarry goo. \nDR. COPPER Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to help me with autopsies on this one and the one Garry shot this morning. \nINT. REC ROOM - LATER - CLOSE ON A TABLE HOCKEY GAME \nFoosball. Nauls and Clark are going at it hot and heavy. \nSanchez sits off in a corner thumbing through an old issue of Photoplay. \nBennings, Norris and Garry are engaged in a card game. Bennings is about to play a card when he feels something under the table. He looks. It is the dog. \nBENNINGS Clark, will you put this mutt with the others where he belong?! \nINT. LAB \nlarger than most of the other rooms and well-equipped. \nDr. Copper is performing an autopsy on the Norwegian intruder, killed early that morning. \nBlair sits over his microscope, while Fuchs prepares slides. The other body is draped with a sheet, waiting its turn. Dr. Copper pulls off his gloves. \nDR. COPPER Nothing wrong with this one. Physiologically, anyway. (to Blair) Find anything toxic? \nBLAIR No drugs... alcohol. Nothing. \nINT. TUNNEL \nClark leads the dog through the long, cold tunnel toward the kennel. A new dressing has been placed on its hip. \n", "test1_true": "INT. KENNEL \nAbout twenty feet long, five feet wide. Poorly lit. \nCramped with dogs. Some of them sleeping. Others pacing around and curious, greet their new companion, sniffing, panting and rubbing up against him. Clark pats the dog and several others, then leaves, latching the door behind him. \nINT. SLEEPING CUBICLE \nChilds lies in his cot watching a small television. The show is a tape of an American TV game show. He has seen this one too many times, extracts the cassette and injects another game show. \nPalmer is stretched out in the other cot, reading a comic book and smoking a joint. Childs beckons for it and takes a hit. \nINT. PUB \nA small area, just off the rec room. Set up like a bar. \nMacReady is alone looking over the rest of the videotapes from the Norwegian outpost. Mundane to esoteric chores of Antarctic camp life. He looks bored. \nINT. LAB \nBlair, hovering over the microscope, lays in a slide, focuses and motions for Dr. Copper to take a look. \nCopper is confused as he examines. He shrugs. \nDR. COPPER I don't understand. \nFuchs takes the opportunity to look. Blair moves over to the disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous, tendon- like appendages. \nBLAIR It's tissue from one of these sinewy rods. \nFuchs is befuddled as he examines. \nFUCHS What in the world kind of cell structure is this? \nBLAIR That's the point. \nDR. COPPER (tired) I don't get you, Blair. \nBLAIR I'm not sure it is any kind of cell structure. Biologically speaking. \nDR. COPPER (sighing) This really isn't my field, Blair. Let's wrap for the day. \nDr. Copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as he exits. Blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body. \nEXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT \nA steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small surrounding shacks. \nINT. REC ROOM \nVacant. The wall clock reads four-thirty. \nINT. HALLWAY \nSleeping cubicles on either side. The sound of snoring. \nINT. PUB \nBleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full- breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He rewinds, then starts it forward again. \nThe screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched. \nIt fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased with something. \nThe tape fades to black again and the picture reappears. \nThis time they have marked off the large oval area with flag sticks. \nCloser shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic at the bottom. \nMacReady leans forward, intrigued. \nThe men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to himself. \nMACREADY Decanite...? Thermite charges...? \nThe tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to shake as the ground beneath it quivers. \nAnother immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force throws the camera to the ground. \nMACREADY What in... \nThe tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around the room. \nINT. KENNEL - NIGHT \nMost of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches them calmly, silently. \nHe takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a bit confused, uncomfortable. \nThe new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres. \n", "test2_input": "He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing. \nCHILDS So Clark was human, huh? \nMacReady nods. \nCHILDS So that make you a murderer. \nMacReady glances over the group. \nMACREADY Palmer now. \nHe sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire. \nGARRY Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing. \nMACREADY Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... (placing the wire in Palmer's dish) ...we'll do you last... \nScreech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate. \nPalmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady knocking him over the table. \nMACREADY Copper!! \nIt's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the Doctor. \nThe others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings. \nMacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor. \nCopper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head. \nThe big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of Dr. Copper. \nThe men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work. \nFrustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head. \nThe shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face. \nSplitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. \nMacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. \nMacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering Childs and Garry with his body. \nA muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as he can. \nCUT TO: \nMACREADY \nperspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares to continue the test. He heats the wire. \nThe men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled. \nOne of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes. \nMacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays glued to the others. \nMacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears. \nThe wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss. \nSanchez breaks down and sobs. \nCHILDS \nsits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn. \nCHILDS Let's do it, Bwana. \nNauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... the harmless hissing. \nThe muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh. \nCHILDS Muthafu... \nALL EYES \nsnap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to, squirms. \nCHILDS Get me... get me the hell away from... cut me loose, damn it! \nNauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard. \nChilds scrambles off the couch and onto the floor. \nGARRY \nstares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin pumps, breathing halts. \n", "test2_true": "Hisssss. \nMacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor. \nSanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his face. \nA long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief. \nGARRY I know you gentlemen have been through a lot. But when you find the time... I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch. \nA beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at Childs' uncontrollable laughter. \nThe infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at Childs. \nNAULS Shut the damn hell up. \nChilds wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes stale, in sudden realization. \nMACREADY (almost a whisper) Blair... \nEXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack. \nBLAIR'S SHACK \nThe door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to balance against the wind. They enter. \nINT. BLAIR'S SHACK \nEmpty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. Something is down there. They pull up more boards. \nThe hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up by some strange metallic object. \nCrudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined. \nSheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be unfinished. \nNAULS What is it? \nMACREADY Everything that's been missing. \nCHILDS Spaceship of some kind. \nMACREADY Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece. \nNAULS Where was he trying to go? \nMACREADY Anyplace but here. \nMacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite. \nMACREADY But he ain't going to make it. \nFar off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. He tosses it in. \nEXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE \nThe explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness. \nSome twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out of sight. \nMacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound. \nThe screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building. \nHe crawls along looking for an opening. \nNauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel. \nHe climbs down through the open stairwell. \nINT. PLANT ROOM \nMacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob. \nHe finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, back and forth. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ \npouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov cocktails. \nGarry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting something into empty contact capsules. The men work feverishly. \nNauls rushes in with another box of dynamite. \n", "test3_input": "MACREADY Wait... \nThe door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady light two cocktails each. \nThe door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked. \nFrom the roof The Thing roars down into their midst. \nStunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. Nauls the same. \nFor a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous. \nGrotesque. \nGarry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door. \nAnother leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. \nThe current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly. \nOne of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening. \nMacReady dives through the window and out into the storm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMPOUND - HALL \nThe distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. But closing. \nThe terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain. \nHe reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about himself, frantically. \nThe Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his fingers as he tries to break it off the siding. \nA strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one side of his throat and rips... \nINT. LAB WALL \nThe motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper tearing half the room to shreds. \nMacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks stark raving mad. \nHis frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks have been tied together at the top and are draped around his neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN. \nThey are used for the weather balloons. \nHe pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his mouth, grins and bellows. \nMACREADY Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be on your toes! We're going to do a little remodeling! \nMacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the prefabricated walls buckling under its force. \nINT. COMPOUND \nA trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend. \nBoom. \nMacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. All the while he keeps his eyes on everything. \nThrough the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings on. \nNARROW PASSAGEWAY \nGurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner in retreat. \nMACREADY (O.S.) Chime in if you know that words, old boy. \nMACREADY \nplows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from the bar. \nMACREADY You like whiskey? Come on, join me for a drink. Be good for you. Grow fangs on your chest. \nHe takes a drink and rams through another wall. \nINT. REC ROOM \nThe tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The Thing when it surprised them earlier. \nMACREADY Damn it, ran out of gas. \nHe pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof, to doorways, to rubble. \nWind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened fingers. \nMACREADY Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... You better make your move... I mean, hell, I'm only one person... \nHe takes a swig from his bottle. \n", "test3_true": "A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap. \nMACREADY But your real hang up is your looks... \nA stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps. \nMACREADY (wants him bad) Atta boy. I know you're around. \nThe floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around the room. \nMACREADY Come on, sucker. \nThe tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting the steering wheel but missing his face. \nHe depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet. \nHe jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through. \nEXT. ROOF \nHe lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs. \nHalf of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like acid into the fabric. \nAn immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating almost immediately. \nThe force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off the insidious limb. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAMP \nA ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground. \nMacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, from his shoulders to the floor. \nHe walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PUB AREA \nMostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled considerably. \nCLOSE ON MACREADY \nlighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours himself a drink. \nA puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs. \nWhite and black blotches cover his frostbitten face. \nCHILDS Did you kill it? \nHe looks as weak as MacReady. A beat. \nMACREADY I think so. \nCHILDS What do you mean \"you think so?\" \nBoth men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously. \nMACREADY Yeah. I got it. (refers to Childs' condition) Pretty mean frostbite. \nChilds steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his puffy white hand. \nCHILDS It'll turn black again soon enough. Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing... (refers to feet) ...Think my toes are already gone. \nMacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other. \nCHILDS So you're the only one who made it. \nMacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard. \nMACREADY Not the only one. \nCHILDS The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though. \nMACREADY Neither will we. \nCHILDS Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. \nMACREADY Maybe we shouldn't. \nCHILDS Then we'll never make it. \nMacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top. \nMACREADY Maybe we shouldn't make it. \nCHILDS (beat) If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours. \n"}

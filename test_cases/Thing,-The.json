{"test1_input": "Garry, Bennings, Dr. Copper, Palmer and MacReady wind their way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper. Dr. Copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies. MacReady, going over his flight chart, looks mad as hell. Dialogue overlaps. \nMACREADY ...Craziness... This is goddamn insane... \nGARRY ...Quit the griping MacReady. Sooner you're there -- sooner you're back. \nMACREADY It's against regulations to go up this time of year! \nDR. COPPER Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there! \nMACREADY So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down. \nGARRY Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up... \nMACREADY What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers! \nPALMER (defiant) Four! \nMACREADY (to Bennings) What is it out there, anyway? Forty- five knots? \nBENNINGS Sixteen. \nMACREADY (disgusted) And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year... \nINT./ EXT. CHOPPER \nDr. Copper sits next to MacReady, who is at the controls. \nMacReady tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck and starts up its choking engine. \nMacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles to get the craft into the air. It finally rights itself and moves up and off into the grey-white sky. \nINT. MAIN COMPOUND \nA couple of the men mingle in the area. Clark, the dog handler, looks out the window. \nCLARK Mac's really taking it up, huh? \nThe dog, a large bandage on his hip, wades through the room. Under tables. Past men's legs. It hobbles slightly. No one takes notice. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CHOPPER \nmoves over a ridge of ice. Columns of smoke can be seen rising ominously from a quarter mile off. \nINT. CHOPPER - POINT OF VIEW \nAs they near, the smoke looms thicker. A black, tar-like gush; billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below. \nEXT. NORWEGIAN CAMP \nSmoke climbs upward in the f.g. MacReady sets his craft down. Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians. \nSmall fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers swirl in every direction. \nINT. CHOPPER \nThe two men look at each other in silence. They get out. \nCLOSE ON A LARGE, MAKESHIFT FUNERAL PYRE \nsmoldering to a close. A hastily conceived crematorium. Wood, books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and the body of a man. \nCurious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within the mess. \nA small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not far off. \nMACREADY AND COPPER \ntheir faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight. \nMacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then exchanges a look with Copper. MacReady heads back toward the chopper. \nTHE CHOPPER \nMacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel behind the seats. \nEXT. THE MAIN BUILDING - THE DOOR \nMacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of snow and embers. MacReady tries the door. It is unlocked. He slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch- black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight. \nDR. COPPER Anybody there?! \nNo answer. Just wind. They exchange a look and enter. \nINT. NARROW CORRIDOR \nThe two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead. The flashlight is not much help. \nFurther down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from within. \n", "test1_true": "MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is blocking it from the other side. \nMACREADY Anybody in there?! \nNothing. \nDR. COPPER We're Americans! \nNothing. \nMACREADY Come to help you!! \nMacReady pushes against the door. \nMACREADY Give me a hand. \nThey push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer- like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and shines the flashlight. \nIt is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room. \nA beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio chair. \nMACREADY Hey, Sweden...! You okay? \nThe chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor. He pokes his gun at the chair's back. \nMACREADY Sweden?! \nDr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor. \nThe two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth. \nHis throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor in his lap. \nMacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. It is locked and barricaded. \nDR. COPPER (more to himself) My God, what in hell happened here? \nMACREADY Come on, Copper. \nThe two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open. \nMore blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous, underground causeway. \nMACREADY Hey, Sweden!!! \nDR. COPPER (irritated) They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe -- \nWhap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in different directions. A panting beat. Silence. \nDr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted by the wind. MacReady takes it. \nMACREADY Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless. \nMacReady pockets it for further viewing. \nINT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS \nThe supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down. \nThe two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning roof. \nThe two men wait until it subsides and then moves on. \nFurther down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light on it. \nAn arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, its fist still gripping a small welding torch. \nThe flame long since gone out. \nMACREADY (wincing) Holy shit... \nHe tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam. \nIts owner is nowhere to be seen. \nMacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles. \nDR. COPPER Christ... \nThey step over the arm and into another slim passageway. \nMoving along they come to rest in front of a door with Norwegian lettering on it. \nMacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the small room with his flashlight. \nDR. COPPER ...Laboratory. \nBroken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated. \nMacReady notices a video camera. \n", "test1_id": 3159, "test2_input": "Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something: a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring growl. \nThe new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling. \nEmitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them into a frenzy. \nBarks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. Three dogs start to close in on the stranger. \nThey attack. \nTHE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG \nagainst the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, seeming larger. \nThe kennel roars. \nINT. PUB \nMacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs. \nINT. NAULS' QUARTERS \nHe, too, bothered by the noise, tosses and turns in his sleep. \nINT. CLARK'S QUARTERS \nClark snores. MacReady has entered. \nMACREADY Clark. \nNo response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed. \nMacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air. \nClark sits up, groggy. \nMACREADY Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of it. \nINT. TUNNEL \nClark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead. \nCLARK \nreaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door. \nCLARK What's got into... \nSmack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. And a screeching from within. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far- off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints. \nHIS BEER CAN \nas it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever. \nINT. TUNNEL \nThe alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark. \nMacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his .44. Clark, a fire ax. \nCLARK I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is. \nINT. HALLWAY \nChaos. Men, half-naked, bounce from their cubicle. \nPulling on their pants, digging into shoes. \nINT. CHILDS' CUBICLE \nChilds is grappling with his belt buckle. \nCHILDS Mac wants the what?! \nBENNINGS (at the doorway) That's what he said. Now! Move! \nBennings is off. \nINT. TUNNEL \nas the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied. \nThe fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady enter the kennel. \nThe light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; the men; the screeching; the blackness. \nCLARK Mac, where are you? \n", "test2_true": "The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner. \nBarking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching. \nDogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray with a vengeance. \nThe flashlight illuminates parts of some \"thing.\" A dog. \nBut not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully. Garry pokes his head into the blackness. \nGARRY What's going on, damn it? \nMacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack. \nMACREADY I'm going to shoot. \nCLARK No! Wait!! \nClark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette. \nFrom out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark smashing violently into the wall. \nOUTSIDE \nMore men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in with Garry, trying to get a look. \nINSIDE \nMacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking him and his flashlight once more to the ground. \nGarry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls for his flashlight. \nMACREADY Clark? Where are you? Clark! \nBlam. Blam. Garry continues firing at the silhouette. \nINT. TUNNEL \nChilds, huffing and puffing, lugs the huge industrial torch toward the crowded kennel doorway. \nCHILDS What's happening? \nMACREADY (O.S.) Childs, you got the torch? You get your ass in here!! \nINT. KENNEL \nChilds scrunches in, disoriented by the blackness, and bumps into Garry, knocking him off balance. \nCHILDS Where are you? \nMacReady signals with his flashlight and then points it at the gathering of snarling dogs. \nMACREADY Torch it over there! \nCHILDS The dogs? \nMACREADY Screw the dogs!! Torch it!! \nChilds lets loose with a burst of blue flame. A mewing, a screeching. \nPart of the kennel starts to burn. \nGARRY (panic) We're on fire! \nMACREADY Don't let up, Childs! \nGARRY (to outside) Extinguishers. \nChilds moves closer, continuing his assault on the hissing, gurgling presence. \nMen charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning walls. Dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and CO2. \nThe screeching lessens. The hissing and gurgling fade. Childs turns off his torch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING \nThose of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet uneasiness. \nBlair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table. \nThey are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out. \nOdd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are wrapped grotesquely about both bodies. \nClark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring at the floor. \nBlair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his face. \nThe dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not far off. \n", "test2_id": 3160, "test3_input": "He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing. \nCHILDS So Clark was human, huh? \nMacReady nods. \nCHILDS So that make you a murderer. \nMacReady glances over the group. \nMACREADY Palmer now. \nHe sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire. \nGARRY Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing. \nMACREADY Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... (placing the wire in Palmer's dish) ...we'll do you last... \nScreech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate. \nPalmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady knocking him over the table. \nMACREADY Copper!! \nIt's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the Doctor. \nThe others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings. \nMacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor. \nCopper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head. \nThe big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of Dr. Copper. \nThe men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work. \nFrustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head. \nThe shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face. \nSplitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. \nMacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. \nMacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering Childs and Garry with his body. \nA muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as he can. \nCUT TO: \nMACREADY \nperspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares to continue the test. He heats the wire. \nThe men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled. \nOne of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes. \nMacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays glued to the others. \nMacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears. \nThe wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss. \nSanchez breaks down and sobs. \nCHILDS \nsits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn. \nCHILDS Let's do it, Bwana. \nNauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... the harmless hissing. \nThe muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh. \nCHILDS Muthafu... \nALL EYES \nsnap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to, squirms. \nCHILDS Get me... get me the hell away from... cut me loose, damn it! \nNauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard. \nChilds scrambles off the couch and onto the floor. \nGARRY \nstares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin pumps, breathing halts. \n", "test3_true": "Hisssss. \nMacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor. \nSanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his face. \nA long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief. \nGARRY I know you gentlemen have been through a lot. But when you find the time... I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch. \nA beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at Childs' uncontrollable laughter. \nThe infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at Childs. \nNAULS Shut the damn hell up. \nChilds wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes stale, in sudden realization. \nMACREADY (almost a whisper) Blair... \nEXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack. \nBLAIR'S SHACK \nThe door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to balance against the wind. They enter. \nINT. BLAIR'S SHACK \nEmpty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. Something is down there. They pull up more boards. \nThe hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up by some strange metallic object. \nCrudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined. \nSheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be unfinished. \nNAULS What is it? \nMACREADY Everything that's been missing. \nCHILDS Spaceship of some kind. \nMACREADY Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece. \nNAULS Where was he trying to go? \nMACREADY Anyplace but here. \nMacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite. \nMACREADY But he ain't going to make it. \nFar off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. He tosses it in. \nEXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE \nThe explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness. \nSome twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out of sight. \nMacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound. \nThe screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building. \nHe crawls along looking for an opening. \nNauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel. \nHe climbs down through the open stairwell. \nINT. PLANT ROOM \nMacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob. \nHe finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, back and forth. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ \npouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov cocktails. \nGarry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting something into empty contact capsules. The men work feverishly. \nNauls rushes in with another box of dynamite. \n", "test3_id": 3161}

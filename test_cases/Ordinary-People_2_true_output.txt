DR BERGER I am. Count on it. 
Conrad falls into Dr Berger's arms, crying. 
150   EXT. JEANNINE'S HOME ­ EARLY MORNING                       150 
Jeannine opens her curtains, sees Conrad, outside her home, walking to and fro. She puts on a jacket and comes out to him. 
CONRAD Hi. I was gonna call but I didn't want to wake anyone. 
JEANNINE Might have been easier... 
CONRAD Listen, I want to say something about the other night. I mean I liked being with you but I didn't like myself. 
JEANNINE Conrad. I was stupid. That was dumb of me to laugh and it was my fault. I just didn't know what to do. I was embarrassed. 
CONRAD Really?   You were embarrassed? 
JEANNINE Yes. When those boys came in, it was awful and awkward. That's what I do when I get embarrassed. I laugh. 
CONRAD But they were all right. They were just up and they were having a good time, and I let them get in the way of what was happening. It was dumb. It was dumb. I've been doing lots of dumb things lately. I just didn't know wether or not you were being straight with me. 
(CONTINUED) 
150   CONTINUED:                                                 150 
Jeannine is moved, she extends her hand to him then put it to her heart. 
CONRAD (cont'd) Yeah? 
Jeannine nods. 
CONRAD (cont'd) Anyway, I'd like to try it again. I thought it worked out okay. Well, except for the bowling. 
Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his eyes. 
JEANNINE Yes. 
CONRAD Yes? 
Jeannine nods. 
JEANNINE Yes. 
Conrad is moved. 
CONRAD Uh...   Are you going to school? 
JEANNINE No, not on Sunday. 
Conrad realizes. Laughs. 
JEANNINE (cont'd) Have you eaten? 
CONRAD No. I haven't. 
JEANNINE Do you want some breakfast? 
Conrad nods. She smiles at him. 
CONRAD Okay. 
They go up the steps and Jeannine opens the screen door. 
JEANNINE Mom! 
151   EXT. HUSTON GOLF ­ AFTERNOON                           151 
(CU) Golf ball falls into hole. 
WARD Oh !... 
BETH All right. How about that? 
CALVIN Boy, oh, boy. 
Beth is beaming from her success at golf. 
BETH Oh, I do love that. 
CALVIN Oh, these holes sure do love you. Oh boy, oh boy. 
BETH We should spend more time playing golf together, you know that? Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf. Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach... 
CALVIN Pinehurst would be nice. I think Connie would like Pinehurst. 
She pulls back and looks at him. 
BETH Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex? 
CALVIN Well, you said "vacation", so I just assumed you meant him too. 
BETH I'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here. 
CALVIN I was gonna call him tonight. 
BETH (to Ward and Audrey) Hey, could we have a little drink before we head back? 
(CONTINUED) 
151   CONTINUED:                                                 151 
WARD Drink, yes. Little, no. (to Calvin) What'd you get? Cal, what'd you get? 
CALVIN (to Ward) Six. (to Beth) Let's finish this.

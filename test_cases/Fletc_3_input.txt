154 OMITTED and 
156 EXT. CABANA ONE 
A little Spanish bungalow-type affair. Old California money-style elegance. Fletch rings the bell. 
MRS. STANWYK (V.O.) Who is it? 
FLETCH It's John. John... (forgets name) Znhcneelsky. 
MRS. STANWYK John Ultramalensky? 
She opens the door, clad only in a towel. A towel is wrapped around her head. She seems surprised, but not displeased, to see Fletch. She also seems a little at a loss for words. 
FLETCH Hi. 
MRS. STANWYK (finally) Hi. 
FLETCH I was hoping you'd say that. 
They have just shaken hands, and Fletch notices his hand is now sopping wet. 
MRS. STANWYK Uh...I'm just out of the shower. 
FLETCH Can I borrow your towel for a minute? 
She laughs a nervous little laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think...What do you want? 
FLETCH I ordered lunch. 
MRS. STANWYK You ordered it here? 
FLETCH Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be. 
MRS. STANWYK Down boy. 
With a nervous glance in both directions, she lets him in and closes the door behind them. 
157 INT. CABANA 
They stand there for a few seconds looking at each other. 
MRS. STANWYK I really should change. 
FLETCH No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today. 
MRS. STANWYK I mean put clothes on. 
FLETCH Here, take mine. 
He starts to take off his shirt. She is amused, and responds playfully, but firmly. 
MRS. STANWYK Stop that! 
He does. 
MRS. STANWYK Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? 
FLETCH Yes. 
She stands there, looking around, trying to act as if her heartbeat weren't speeding up. 
SFX: Knock at door. 
FLETCH Lunch.... 
MRS. STANWYK God.... 
She goes sprinting into the bathroom. 
FLETCH Come on in. 
The door opens. A second Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the goodies ordered by Fletch. The twin bottle of Dom Perignon juts from a silver ice bucket. 
WAITER You want I set up? 
FLETCH No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.

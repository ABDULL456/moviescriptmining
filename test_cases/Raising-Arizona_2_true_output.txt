In voice-over, Hi is composing a letter. 
VOICE OVER My dearest Edwinna. Tonight as you and Nathan slumber, my heart is filled with anguish. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
INT. TRAILER 
Creeping in on Hi 's hunched back, as he sits over the kitchen table writing the letter. The yellow lamp sitting on the table is the only light on in the trailer. 
VOICE OVER ...I hope that you will both understand, and forgive me for what I have decided I must do. By the time you read this, I will be gone. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
LIVING ROOM 
Creeping in on GALE and EVELLE, sprawled on the sofa and easy chair respectively, sawing boards. 
VOICE OVER ...I will never be the man that you want me to be, the husband and father that you and Nathan deserve... 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
BACK TO HI 
Still creeping in. 
VOICE OVER Maybe it's my upbringing; maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up - I don't know... 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
INT. 7-ELEVEN 
Creeping in on the pimply-faced Cashier, sitting asleep behind the counter, a dirty magazine lying face-down, open on his chest. 
VOICE OVER But the events of the last day have showed, amply, that I don't have the strength of character to raise up a family... 
We are slowly panning over to the newspaper rack, revealing tomorrow's headline: "WHERE IS NATHAN JR.?" 
VOICE OVER ...in the manner befitting a responsible adult, and not like the wild man from Borneo. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
ARIZONA HOME 
Creeping in on Nathan Jr. in the living room, asleep in his ottoman armchair, lit only by the snow from the TV set he is facing, a half-full glass of milk on the coffee table next to him. 
His robe is disheveled; his eyeglasses have slid down his nose. 
VOICE OVER ...I say all this to my shame. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
TRAILER BEDROOM 
Creeping in on Ed and Nathan Jr., asleep together in the double bed. Ed's arm is draped protectively over the sleeping infant. 
VOICE OVER ...I will love you always, truly and deeply. But I fear that if I stay I would only bring bad trouble... 
We start to hear the rumble of the motorcycle mix up again. 
VOICE OVER ...on the heads of you and Nathan Jr. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
BLACKNESS 
Night sky. The motorcycle tire enters frame as the bike comes to a halt. The Biker plants a jackbooted foot in the foreground. 
The engine rumbles. 
VOICE OVER I feel the thunder gathering even now; if I leave, hopefully, it will leave with me. 
We are craning up over the Biker's back to reveal what he is looking at: We are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park. In the window of one trailer below, a yellow light glows. 
VOICE OVER I cannot tarry... 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 
BACK TO HI 
Still creeping in. 
VOICE OVER Better I should go, send you money, and let you curse my name. Your loving... Herbert. 
FADE OUT 
FIRE 
Roaring at the cut. Through it we can see the Biker sitting on the ground, legs stretched out in front of him, back resting against his parked motorcycle, arms folded across his chest. 
Perfectly motionless, he stares at the campfire. 
We are floating in toward him. 
As we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of his face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his eyes: He seems to have none. Although his eyes are unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire - either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring - burning-inside. 
CLOSE SHOT DOOR MAT 
It reads: "Come On In! To Unpainted Arizona." 
The smoking butt of a cheroot is dropped onto the mat. A jackbooted foot grinds it out. 
CLOSE SHOT BAR ON GLASS DOOR 
Leading into the showroom. The Biker's mail-and-chained fist pushes the door open.

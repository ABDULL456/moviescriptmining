EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN strutting confidently down the narrow GUARDRAIL between the two directions of SPEEDING TRAFFIC. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She could be out for an evening stroll, ignoring the SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder. 
EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
A CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA. CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray ones off her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. She cocks her head, listening in different directions for a new source of amusement -- snippets of VOICES, MUSIC, PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES... it's like tuning a radio. Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS -- 
INT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT 
Dimly lit, an older, discount place. THIEF #1 methodically breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer, snatches up the contents -- necklaces, rings, etc. -- stuffing them into a 
BAG. 
As he moves, a SHADOWY FIGURE -- CATWOMAN -- moves with him, looking over his shoulder, close enough to touch but unseen. Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his view -- her timing is impeccable. THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard over a blindfolded, bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN. CATWOMAN appears on the periphery of his vision, but when he turns his head she's disappeared behind a case -- she emerges on the other side just before he turns back. THIEF #3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS with a BLOWTORCH and TOOLS. CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across the CASE above him, he looks up -- but there's nobody there. He returns to his work, gets the CASE open and pulls out a DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering DIAMONDS. 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) 
Oooh, pretty. THE THREE THIEVES spin, looking around -- 
THIEF #1 
Up there! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THIEF #2 aims his SHOTGUN at -- CATWOMAN, perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding. She VAULTS down just as he FIRES, a SPRAY OF PLASTER. THIEF #2 pumps his shotgun, looking around frantically. 
THIEF #2 
What the hell was that?! CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE, gives Thief #2 a roundhouse KICK in the head that sends the man into a wall, knocking him cold. THIEF #1 pulls a HANDGUN, but the END OF THE WHIP wraps around it in a flash, yanks it from his hand. CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief #1 and Thief #3, backing them into a corner. As she passes the tied-up GUARD, she uses her claws to SLASH his ropes. In time with WHIP CRACKS 
CATWOMAN 
You boys -- thought you could just barge -- in here and take -- all these beautiful things -- that don't belong to you... The guard quickly tears off his GAG and BLINDFOLD, untying his own feet, then picks up the fallen handgun and trains it on the thieves. We hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. CATWOMAN meanwhile swiftly gathers up fallen jewels, sweeping them into the swag bag. She pauses for a moment, thoughtful. 
CATWOMAN 
(to herself) What a lovely idea. 
With lightning speed, she vanishes out the back with the bag. THE GUARD, totally focused on the thieves, doesn't even register she's gone. THIEF #3 points -- 
THIEF #3 
Hey... 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE ALLEY - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN bounds out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window A/C UNIT, which totters with her weight, just as -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt, and TOM LONE leaps out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN -- 
LONE 
Freeze! CATWOMAN freezes. She blinks down at LONE, he's got a clean shot at her. She cocks her head, licks her lips. 
CATWOMAN 
You are cute. LONE blinks at this uncommon response to a pointed weapon, continues to play it by the book. 
LONE 
I'm a police officer! 
CATWOMAN 
Bet you look sweet in uniform.   And such a big gun... 
LONE 
I, I -- Come down here, now! 
CATWOMAN 
Obviously you don't know much about cats.   I come when I want, not when I'm told. With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out of the way as it CRASHES to the ground. 
EXT. ROOFTOPS/CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN, silhouetted against the sky, is having a great time, leaping from building to building, scrambling across rooftops. POLICE SIRENS recede in the distance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ZOO - DAWN 
THE SUN is rising. PAN OVER a couple of GLITTERING JEWELS in the dirt. FIND CATWOMAN in the GOLDEN MORNING LIGHT, curled against what looks like a TIGER-SKIN PILLOW. She stirs and groans in her sleep, like someone waking with a hangover. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE. CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit; the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist. She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly, starts moving in for the kill. PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT just as the TIGER LUNGES --

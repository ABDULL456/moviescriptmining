INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Slowly, quietly, Edward descends the stairs with Lucy asleep in his arms. Margaret in front of him, moving in tandem, holding a roll of duct tape. 
They reach the bottom. Margaret rushes ahead into the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Edward carries Lucy toward the OLD GAS OVEN where Margaret waits, holding open the door. 
Delicately, cradling her head, Edward puts Lucy into the oven without waking her. But as he lifts the door, one of the metal hinges CREAKS. 
Lucy jolts awake with a SCREAM. Kicks open the door before Edward can shut it. With animal terror she thrashes her way out onto the linoleum floor. Margaret throws a piece of duct tape over her mouth, silencing her screams as Edward wrestles her back into the oven. But she kicks open the door again and the frantic struggle continues as... 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Emily's car lurches to a stop out front. As she jumps out, Barron's pickup arrives. He joins her, a reluctant accomplice. 
BARRON What are we doing here? 
EMILY Saving her life! 
She goes up the walkway. Barron lagging a few steps behind, eyeing the darkened house. 
BARRON They're asleep. 
EMILY They're not asleep. 
Emily hears something inside the house. 
EMILY Did you hear that? 
BARRON I didn't hear anything. 
Emily, trusting her gut, starts pounding on the door. 
EMILY Leave her alone! 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Hearing Emily, Edward and Margaret intensify their efforts, jamming Lucy's legs inside the oven. The duct tape peels off her mouth in the struggle and before the oven door slams shut she belts out one last desperate SCREAM. 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Clearly audible outside, it makes Barron jump. 
EMILY Did you hear that?! 
Barron pounds his big fist on the door. 
BARRON Police, open up! 
EMILY Break it down! 
Barron rams his shoulder against the door, but it holds solid. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
We see Lucy's screaming face through the oven window as Margaret cranks the temperature dial as high as it will go. 
INT. GAS OVEN - NIGHT 
From inside we see Edward and Margaret peering in as Lucy claws at the glass with her fingernails. Coughing as the gas fills the oven with a low hiss. We hear it ignite beneath her with a faint poof. The first shimmering waves of heat rising up, singeing her hair. 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Emily, hysterical, knowing they're too late: 
EMILY BREAK IT DOWN! 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The front door comes crashing down, kicked off its hinges by Barron. Emily and he race in. 
EMILY LUCY?! 
They take off toward the kitchen at the end of the hall. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Emily and Barron rush in. Emily sees Lucy trapped inside the oven. The sleeve of her pajamas catching fire. 
EMILY Oh my God... 
Edward tries to fend Barron off. It's a mistake. Barron unleashes a devastating blow that sends him recoiling into the fridge so hard the back of his head leaves a visible dent in the door.

INT.. BEDROOM- NIGHT 
EMMA FRANKLIN and ADAM KURTZMAN Naked in bed but covered.in sheets. Lying next to each other, but not touching. Emma stall has her shoes on. 
EMMA I don't know. 
ADAM What about "Comrades-in-Fuck"?. 
EMMA No. 
ADAM What if we say we're in the Axis of Fuck? we formed a Fuck Alliance. We're neighbors 'on.. Fuck Street. 
EMMA What's wrong with "buddies'? 
ADAM Who says "buddies"? 
EMMA Yeah, you're right. 
INT. PAVILLION CAMP . WEEHAWKEN-- IGHT- 
1994. A summer camp in- Northern Michigan. It's a dance. An over-enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo. Coolio's "Fantastic Voyage" blasts. 
About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the side. 'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano. 
They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle is KATIE, the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else. And every time she moves; she bounces. 
The boys watch her, serious, concentrating. They need to remember this for later. Katie continues to bounce- One boy suddenly looks down, scared. 
BOY It tickles. 
OTHER BOY- Yeah. It does other stuff. But there's a boy on the, edge of the group : A sweet. face, 'and you wouldn't be surprised to- find but he's Jewish: A 12 year - old, Adam Kurtzman. He's the only boy not looking at Katie. Instead, he's staring off in another direction. 
On the other side of the dance floor, next to an 'enormously ' fat kid, there's Emma. She's an awkward 12. Wearing borrowed clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she can't fill out. She's taller than any of the boys. But there's something in her eyes, like she's laughing at everything. 
She makes eye,contact with Adam: She squints., He takes -a deep breath,. She squints some more. He walks over.-'. 
ADAM Hey. - 
EMMA Hey. A 'long' pause'. -They're not looking at each other. Then 
ADAM Do you want to, freak? 
INT. PAV'ILLION-- MOMENTS LATER 
TLC's "No Scrubs." Emma and Adam are freaking awkwardly - Emma is too tall and Adam is holding on too tight and just bouncing up and down. - 
ADAM You freak, good. 
EMMA Okay. 
ADAM - (singing along with the SONG) "No, I don't want no scrubs"-- 
EMMA I don't get it.' 
ADAM Urn. She doesn't want a -scrub; Because he's hanging out of his. best friend's ride, trying to -holler at her. Katie, in another part of the dance floor, is in the middle of a big freak-sandwich. 
KATIE 
CAMP RULES! Emma scowls at her, looks at Adam. 
EMMA Let's go to the dumpster- 
ADAM 
(SURPRISED) We're not even going out. 
EMMA 
(DEADPAN) But I feel like I've known you.my whole life. 
EXT. CAMP GROUNDS- NIGHT - 
Emma and Adam awkwardly stand against-the wall near the dumpster. There are couples on either side. of them making out. So. 
ADAM I've enjoyed camp. There's all kinds of fun activities. For example, I learned how to-archer. 
EMMA That's good. That'll be useful if you ever make a time machine and go back'to the medieval ages:-and then your-time machine breaks, and you get attacked by knights.

GALEN 
He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him. 
ULRICH (a shout) We have visitors! 
CUT TO: 
ROTUNDA - NIGHT 
Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it. 
CONJURING ROOM 
Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem of a black robe. 
ULRICH Looks forbidding enough, don't you think? 
GALEN Here are your sticks. 
ULRICH No -- they'll think me infirm. You know, Balisarius wore this whenever he changed lead into gold. He could really do that, you know. I never could. Too bad -- you'd stand to inherit some real wealth. 
GALEN You're in a morbid frame of mind. What's all this about dying? You don't even look sick. 
ULRICH (tying on a sash) You still wearing that amulet? (Galen nods) Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs to me. 
He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto his head. 
ULRICH Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a handful of that sulphurous ash over there... 
The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase. 
THE ROTUNDA 
The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich. 
Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat. 
ULRICH Nunc habeus lux! 
Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches. 
ULRICH Et calor! 
In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward the warmth. 
ULRICH Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. Which one of you calls himself Valerian? 
The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's performance. The young leader of the party screws up his courage and speaks. 
VALERIAN That would be me. We are here on behalf... 
ULRICH I know why you're here. You're a delegation from Urland, from beyond Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts. 
The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on the table for Ulrich's inspection.

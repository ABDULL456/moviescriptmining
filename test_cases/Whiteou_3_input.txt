Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate -- glass is too thick -- protection from the cold. 
Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward toward the opening doors. 
Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce. He's bleeding profusely. 
She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest. 
Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open. 
PRYCE ...I didn't see him. 
His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face -- 
CARRIE No!    You stay awake! 
Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure. Blood continues to ooze. 
She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the hangar. 
Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Damn it! (to Delfy) Come on. We're getting him up. 
They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can. Go outside. 
EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 
The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the ground. 
Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused. 
CARRIE Press here.    Hard. Hard or he will die! 
DELFY It won't stop! 
Looks Delfy right in the eye. 
CARRIE He's not going to be number four!

Pryce moans. 
Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner. 
Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it around him. Keeps repeating the motion. 
She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane moving toward the runway. 
The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake. 
PRYCE (GASPING) What are you doing?   Get Keller. 
She holds him down. 
CARRIE You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down. (BEAT) You hold on. 
Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick draw. Keys it. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet? 
Beat. 
MURPHY (V.O.) No -- what's going -- 
CARRIE Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc? 
MURPHY (V.O.) In the clinic. About to bring the bodies out. What's -- 
CARRIE Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters. 
Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the two- way. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CARRIE (cont'd) Don't let him die.

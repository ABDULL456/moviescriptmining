ARTHUR (CONT'D) You really are a shoddy mother. 
Vivienne eventually looks up. 
VIVIENNE Did I hear you say you were meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's nice. Right. Today we're going to have a friendly chat. Then a serious talk. And lastly make a timetable. How does all that sound? 
ARTHUR Amazing. Do you have any vodka? 
VIVIENNE What happened, Arthur? You were such a sweet baby. 
ARTHUR I still wake up in my own poo occasionally. 
VIVIENNE Right, that's it for the chat. Time to transition to our talk. 
Vivienne hits a remote control. A large wall-mounted screen fills with a changing collage of him drunk, dancing, puking, making out with women, beside countless news headlines. 
VIVIENNE (CONT'D) This insanity has to end, Arthur. As the delightful coffee-coloured gentleman who runs this country said, `The time has come to set aside childish things.' 
ARTHUR Can't Hobson set them aside for me? 
VIVIENNE Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet are on the ground, she's of fine stock... 
ARTHUR (GETS UP) Oh. That's what this is all about. I'm not marrying Susan. I don't love her. 
VIVIENNE And? You think I spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows? 
ARTHUR Not after you ran him over in the Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's not funny. 
VIVIENNE Ditto your father. The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur. It's about stability. Continuity... 
ARTHUR ...and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account. 
VIVIENNE The Johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue. Burt is a pillar of the community. 
ARTHUR His baby formula was taken off the market in six African countries! 
VIVIENNE A completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway. The families all got gift baskets as compensation. That little bump in the road aside, Burt is a devout Christian. 
ARTHUR Yes, because they're never insane. And where did he get Jesus? 
VIVIENNE (GETTING EXASPERATED) Burt paid his debt to society years ago. 
ARTHUR He strangled a fireman! Who strangles a fireman? 
VIVIENNE Arthur... 
ARTHUR I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met someone else very lovely who, as far as I know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood. 
VIVIENNE Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end of our line. We need an heir. 
ARTHUR I nearly gave you an heir! 
VIVIENNE Oh, give me strength! A Bach- Templemead having a child by a lap dancer called `Mystery'? 
ARTHUR That was just her stage name! To give her more mystery when she...waved her fanny around. Her real name was...what was it again? 
VIVIENNE Susan is 33 this year. Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone! 
ARTHUR Great! I like hugs! And some of them are really good at math. (heading to the door) You know the `Frog and Toad' books? 
VIVIENNE No. 
ARTHUR Of course you don't. Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl. 
VIVIENNE Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense... 
ARTHUR That I won't follow in his footsteps and marry a woman I hate? I think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it. 
VIVIENNE Suit yourself. 
Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier. 
VIVIENNE (CONT'D) My will, which I have updated to designate Grant in reception as the sole beneficiary. 
ARTHUR You wouldn't! You're my... 
VIVIENNE ...Vivienne? Try me. 
Vivienne opens a draw and takes out A HUGE RING BOX. 
VIVIENNE (CONT'D) Shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting?

AUDREY Really? I'd like to find out. 
She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to Raymond who has cut above his eye. 
ANIMAL Hey Man, you all right? 
RAYMOND I could use a coffee. 
We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting upwards when suddenly... 
THAT FAMOUS WAIL 
Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes, a very angry GODZILLA emerges! 
Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression of Godzilla's face; pain. 
But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and accusingly, at our heroes. 
NICK Ohhhhhhhh.....shit. 
ANIMAL What do we do? 
RAYMOND Running would be a good idea. 
And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our team DARTS around a corner just in time. 
238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238 
As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley. 
ANGLE - ALLEY WAY 
Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings. They run for their lives as Godzilla appears behind them. 
His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward. 
Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side. 
Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path. 
239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239 
Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked YELLOW CAB. 
240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240 
In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's amazing. 
As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out. 
241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241 
Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner. 
242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242 
Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner behind them Godzilla appears. 
As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down another street. 
243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243 
The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another building. 
244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244 
The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side street. 
245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245 
Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he does. 
246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246 
Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and begins filming out the shattered back window. 
AUDREY Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway. 
ANIMAL You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK. 
AUDREY The JFK? In the rain!? 
247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247 
LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it. 
248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248 
ANIMAL What are you talking about? The east side is always faster. 
AUDREY But we can get to the west side faster. 
Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly, darting down a side street. 
RAYMOND Somebody make up your mind! 
AUDREY & ANIMAL Take central park! 
249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249

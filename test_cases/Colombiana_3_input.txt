CLOSE ON A PAGE OF A LARA CROFT COMIC BOOK 
Being copied, with uncanny precision, down to the last detail, by a ten year old hand clutching a pencil. 
VOICE Cataleya! 
The page of a notebook turns, revealing neat cursive handwriting, covers the comic. 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home, with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela, attends to her notebook. 
On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand. 
MOTHER Cat! Is your homework finished yet? 
CAT Working on it Mama. 
Her mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara Croft comic and it's copy. 
MOTHER You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study. 
CAT I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero. 
Her mother turns the page back to the lessons. 
MOTHER Better to be a doctor. A lawyer. 
CAT Are we going to see Uncle Emilio? 
MOTHER I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father. 
Cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat, her mother, and her father. Her face carries a bit of worry. 
CLOSE ON 
DON LUIS I can't believe this. 
Mid 40'S, a gentleman, calm, courteous, impeccably dressed. 
PULL BACK TO 
EXT. DON LUIS'S GARDEN - DAY 
At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don Luis sits opposite... 
FABIO Why not? 
Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man, MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive. 
DON LUIS Because I love you Fabio. Like a brother. 
FABIO And I love you Don Luis. Like a brother. 
He turns to Marco. 
DON LUIS Can you believe this guy Marco? We started when we were little...how old were we Fabio? 
FABIO Ten. 
DON LUIS Ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market. After all we've been through. And now we're on top, he wants to leave... 
FABIO Luis, I'm going to be honest with you. You remember I had that operation? 
DON LUIS That was last year. 
FABIO Since then, I'm not a hundred percent. And you can't do this thing if you're not a hundred percent. I'm tired. 
DON LUIS So you'll take a rest. 
FABIO You know how many times we should have been dead? 
DON LUIS I don't even want to count. 
FABIO Neither do I. But you gotta think. How lucky we are to still be alive. 
DON LUIS Yeah. That's right. We're alive. And what about the future of this thing we built? 
FABIO It's yours. It's not my thing any more. 
DON LUIS I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I cabron? 
FABIO I'll always be there for you Luis. Just pick up the phone, I'm there. 
DON LUIS I'm gonna hold you to that. You bastard. (EMOTIONAL) I'm going to miss you. 
FABIO And I'm going to miss you. 
DON LUIS OK. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! One last drink, huh? 
He pours the liquor into the glasses. 
DON LUIS To the future. 
They tap glasses.

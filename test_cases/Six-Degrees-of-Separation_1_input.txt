THROATS SLASHED THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp. FLAN and OUISA are serious. THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March. EVERYONE stands. THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle. CU OUISA'S FACE lost in thought. Bright vivid colors fill the screen. Later we will learn they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which 
HANGS IN 
THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM. 
OUISA (VO) 
Chaos. OUISA'S face appears briefly, smiling, then is replaced by dark, geometric patterns. The other side of the painting. It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious. 
OUISA (VO) Control. (The painting is flipped.) Chaos. (OUISA smiles. Flips it again. Frowns.) Control. 
BACK IN THE CHAPEL OUISA, still frowning at her memory, realizes the wedding ceremony is over. THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE to the strains of Lohengrin. But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and OUISA are in. 
GROOM Is everything all FLAN snaps out of it, putting on his party smile. 
FLAN We always get this way at weddings. THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle. It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the aisle. SHE is stricken. 
OUISA I do not always get this way at weddings. 
FLAN We're alive. THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel. SHE puts her head into his shoulder. 
OUISA Oh, it was awful awful awful awful. Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with the 
WEDDING COUPLE. 
BRIDE 
Did you say you could have been killed? 
OUISA (MERRY) Yes! Only hours ago! 
FLAN (MERRY) But we're here! 
OUISA Wouldn't miss it! THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM. 
EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots of tennis courts. 
INT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club, all bright white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs seem to find. MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the club waiting for the Bride and Groom. FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom. 
THEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR. THEY sit at a small table, pulling themselves together. SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them) come up to THEM. A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with them. SHE is named JULIA. 
SANDY We hate to pry - 
FLAN No no. You're not prying 
CONNIE But what happened - 
SANDY This is our friend Julia 
FLAN Do we know each other? 
JULIA Oh yes through... 
9 FLAN Of course. Haven't seen them in years FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance. 
CONNIE We're worried for you FLAN and OUISA look at each other. 
OUISA Tell them! SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table. 
FLAN We were having a wonderful evening last night. 
OUISA A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner. I don't think you know him - 
FLAN (PORTENTOUSLY) Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa-- 
OUISA Don't say it so portentously. 
FLAN (BRIGHT) Geoffrey from South Africa. 
OUISA Don't be ga-ga. (THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER.) Something large. 
SANDY I didn't know Geoffrey was in town. 
JULIA I saw him at Susie Baxter's 
SANDY I wasn't at Susie Baxter's 
CONNIE Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter. THE WAITER goes. 
SAVOY That's no reason why she can't invite me to a party. CONNIE whispers to JULIA, her eyes on FLAN.

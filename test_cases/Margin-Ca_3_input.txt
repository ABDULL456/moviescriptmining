SETH Two and a half million goes quickly? 
WILL EMERSON Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what?? 
PETER Eight hundred. 
WILL EMERSON I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day... 
SETH Smart. (smiles) 
(CONTINUED) 39   CONTINUED: (3)                                                39 
WILL EMERSON And what's that? 
PETER 125 left. 
WILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette. 
WILL EMERSON I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores. 
PETER 
WILL EMERSON Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment. 
With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads. 
THEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise. 
PETER                             SETH Whoa!                               Whoa! 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) What time is it? 
SETH 
WILL EMERSON Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there. 
INT. JARED COHEN'S CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
JARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window. 
SAM ROGERS How old are you? 
JARED COHEN 
(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED:                                                       40 
SAM ROGERS Jesus... 
JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares out the window as well. 
JARED COHEN This is a very... very bad dream. 
SAM looks over at him directly. 
SAM ROGERS I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up. 
SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Hello. 
JARED COHEN Come in. 
SAM ROGERS How do we look? 
Her look says it all. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) I should go. 
SARAH ROBERTSON No, you should stay. 
JARED COHEN So? 
SARAH ROBERTSON (dead calm delivery) It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless. 
They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost.

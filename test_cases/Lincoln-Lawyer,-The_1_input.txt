MICK Yes you did. 
LORNA Yes I did. Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved-- 
MICK Now go, and be ready for my call. Lorna starts to go-- then pauses. 
LORNA I'm crazy about the power suit. Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching. 
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 
No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document. 
KURLEN What shit is this, Haller? I got nothing to do with your case! Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise-- 
MICK Subpoena to appear as a witness? You'll just have to wait and see. It's a legal document, Detective. Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick with the "legal document." He tucks it away-- And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP: 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.) Mr. Minton-- 
INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Does the state have any rebuttal? 
TED (rises, ready) The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness. 
MICK Judge? Who is this witness? Why wasn't I told before now? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT A fair question. Mr. Minton? 
TED Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody, following his arrest. 
LOUIS (shouts, suddenly--) Bullshit! I didn't to talk to-- 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller, control your client! Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce-- 
MICK That was good. Now leave it to me. (to the court) I do share my client's outrage, your honor. I'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony... 
TED Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday. 
MICK 
(OUTRAGED) This is incredible... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you want to go back and talk to him? Given the timing I'd allow it. 
MICK No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie-- 
TED That's groundless, your honor-- 
MICK --I just want my objection noted. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then I'm going to rule he can 
TESTIFY-- 
MICK Can I ask one indulgence? Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator? For whatever good it will do at this late date. 
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM 
Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering-- 
LORNA'S VOICE Yep, here. 
MICK Put your watch at quarter of. At ten fifteen you enter the room. 
LORNA'S VOICE Got it. 
MICK With the printouts. 
LORNA'S VOICE Mickey, I know the moves! He snaps shut his cell-phone. 
INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND 
Prison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky. 
TED Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time? 
CORLISS Um, no, now I'm just in the courtroom. Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething...

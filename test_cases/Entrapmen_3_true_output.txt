INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT 
Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up... 
GIN That's my purse. 
He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage... 
MAC Just want to see if I'm with the person you say you are.  Can't be too caref... 
She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car SWERVES LEFT, and... 
...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific NOISE. 
MAC (quietly) Oh, dear. 
People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had been crushed beneath Mac's wheels. 
Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through... 
MAC (subtitled Japanese) We'll go in there, and call the police. 
And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square 30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the crowd, all race after the limping Mac... 
GIN Are you all right? 
No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice... 
MAC (subtitled Japanese) I have damaged the car of these kind people.  Please help them call the police... 
One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard... 
MAC (subtitled Japanese) May I use a washroom, please. 
The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his billfold to Gin... 
MAC These are my papers, passport, car registration.  If the police arri... 
GIN You're going to need stitches, let me get you to a hospital. 
Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it. Softer still... 
GIN Really, this can all wait. I'll handle it. 
The look holds. 
MAC That's actually.  Very sweet. 
His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for. 
MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese) Might you have a First Aid kit, of some kind? 
INT. TOILET STALL 
We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall. Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and... 
...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door, hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash, and simply... 
...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES, dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit, SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the prosthetic DOWN the hole. 
He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge into... 
...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He reaches now... 
...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be... 
...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to the floor... 
...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR. 
INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR 
Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters). He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN.. 
INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR 
Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He enters... 
...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters... 
INT. CLEAN ROOM 
...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part of the microchip manufacturing process. 
More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed MICROCHIPS... 
...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into... 
...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses, fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to... 
...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils, and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose... 
...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he enters... 
...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in eerie red light.  He begins to... 
...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when suddenly... 
...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster, HARDER...

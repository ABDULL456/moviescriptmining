33   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                   33 
Jenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from downstairs. 
34   INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT                                    34 
She stands outside the living room for a moment, listening. She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father, and then more laughter from her father and mother. 
35   INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                                     35 
David is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's entrance. 
JENNY (curious) Hello. 
JACK Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the Goons. 
DAVID I don't think I'm very good at Eccles. 
JACK Oh, no, you've got him... 
JENNY (impatiently) But what's he doing here? 
DAVID I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone. 
JENNY (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad? 
JACK Is that so hard to imagine? 
Jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table. 
JENNY And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas! 
JACK Hark at her! Makes us sound as though we've signed the pledge. You don't know everything about us, you know. We had a life before you came along. 
JENNY Yes, that's true. I'm only going on what I've seen over the last sixteen years. 
MARJORIE I'm trying to think what you missed. Nothing much comes to mind. 
JACK They can't stand to see me enjoying myself. 
JENNY Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've got a huge pile of Latin translation to do. 
JACK You didn't tell me David went to Oxford. 
Jenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight- faced. 
JENNY No. I didn't. 
DAVID For all the good it did me. 
JACK What did you read? 
DAVID Oh, English. Just like every other semi-employed layabout in London. 
JACK (marvelling at the coincidence) English! Which college? 
DAVID Merton. 
MARJORIE Isn't that funny? 
JENNY Extraordinary. 
DAVID I was just telling Jack that I'm going back next weekend. I go and see my old professor every now and again. 
JACK That's what you need, Jenny. Someone on the inside track. It's not always what you know, is it, David? 
DAVID Too true. And Clive would love Jenny. Have you ever come across Clive Lewis? 
JENNY Dad has never come across anyone. 
DAVID I just thought he might know some of the books. 
JENNY Dad has never read any books. 
JACK (stung) What's he written? 
DAVID He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe. 
MARJORIE CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about? 
DAVID Well, to us he was just the old codger who taught Medieval literature. But I came to know him very well. We just...got along, do you know what I mean?

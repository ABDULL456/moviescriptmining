{"train": "CLIFFHANGER \nWritten by \nMichael France \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY \nAn unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado Rockies. The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains like a low fog. The tranquility is broken as a helicopter BLASTS into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center of it all. \nOur CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range. There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches to large plateaus. One of the mountains has a crystal lake on top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the middle of a mountain wall. Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top. \nBACK IN THE HELICOPTER \nWe can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out -- \nINT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV \nThe glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks like nothing more than a field of gray and white. \nFRANK (O.S.) Nothing yet. \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT \nThe helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- \"The Tower\", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below. \nINSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE \nSpotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall.  MAGGIE DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team. \nFRANK Wait a minute -- there's Hal. (beat) And his date. \nBINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE \nthat's part of the smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s) and his \"date\", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), are decked out in climbing gear. Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's worried look shows she isn't. Hal and Susan huddle together, both cold, but okay. Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand. \nINSIDE HELICOPTER \nFrank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind. \nMAGGIE How do they look? \nBINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN \nHal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and starts jerking off the flare. \nFRANK (O.S.) He's signalling \"okay.\" \nMAGGIE (O.S.) Where's Gabe? \nThe POV dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an orange rescue jacket. \nFRANK (O.S.) Right where he's supposed to be. \nCLOSER ON THE CLIMBER \nThis is GABE WALKER (30s). In spite of the cold and the snow, he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. That's because he has done it a hundred times. This is what Gabe lives for. \nON THE LEDGE \nGabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and tries to light a cigarette. The lighter only sparks. \nHAL Excuse me -- I know you're my salvation, and all -- do you think you could rescue us before your smoke break? \nHal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield it against the wind. Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar routine. We know in a glance they've been friends for years. \nGABE Maybe you could tell me why I am rescuing you. \nHAL Basically -- I've fallen down, and I can't get up... \nGABE (into radio) Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over -- \nTHE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it land there. Frank lowers a rescue wire to \nGABE \nwho precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the wire is just out of reach. Hal grabs the radio. \nHAL Rescue One -- please remind me to tell you about the time I hauled your hero here down Mt. Huntington on my back, over -- \nMAGGIE (O.S.) (through radio) Hal, if I hear that story one more time, I'm making you limp down the entire three thousand feet, over -- \nGabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and hammers it into the wall. \nGABE (to Susan) This guy showing you a good time? \nTHE HELICOPTER \nswings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau. Frank gets out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the chasm. \nON THE LEDGE \nGabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets the butt. Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line. \nGABE Now, remember -- keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times -- \nHAL (laughing) Fuck you -- \nWith that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping line -- Hal makes a point of looking down -- \nHAL'S POV -- THE DROP \nis vertigo defined. Thirty five hundred feet straight down. You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high. However -- \nHAL \nlets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out. Hal gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals thumbs-up, and sends it back. \nGABE \ndeliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself at Susan -- \nTHEIR HANDS \nmiss -- \nANGLE ON BOTH \nGabe's three foot safety line pulls taut, testing the limits of the line above as it yanks him back -- \nGABE'S POV - SUSAN \nis just out of reach -- her hand is still stretched out, her eyes still locked on \nGABE \nwho can only look down, swaying helplessly on the wire as Susan's SCREAM starts -- \nON THE OPPOSITE SIDE \nFrank and Maggie look down in horror, but neither look as anguished as Hal -- \nLONG SHOT - SUSAN \nfalling -- falling -- falling -- looking very small against the vast mountain range -- \nSUSAN'S POV - FALLING \nfrom this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can imagine -- \nGABE \ntwists from his safety line, spinning helplessly -- he wants to, but can't, shut his eyes -- \nGABE'S POV - THE CHASM \nSusan is gone. Her SCREAM, cut short, echoes -- the \"safety\" harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT/EXT SMALL AIRLINER - GABE'S POV OUT WINDOW - DAY \nAs the plane dips to land, Gabe can see a bird circling far below, over the same mountainous terrain. \nINT. SMALL AIRLINER - GABE \nsweating, panting, awake. It hasn't been that long since the accident -- a year, to be exact -- but he looks older. He looks as if he's watched Susan Collins drop at least one hundred times. Gabe reels himself in as a STEWARDESS hands him a glass of water. \nSTEWARDESS Take this. (Gabe does) Afraid of flying? \nGabe shakes his head. \nGABE Falling. \nINT. TERMINAL - DAY \nGabe, with no luggage, is at the small airport's only car rental counter, doing the paperwork for a RENTAL AGENT. \nRENTAL AGENT Midsize? \nGABE Any size, any color, any model. \nRENTAL AGENT How long will you be needing it? \nGABE (flat) Just under six hours. \nMAGGIE (O.S.) You aren't wasting any time, are you? \nGabe turns and looks at \nMAGGIE \nwho is standing off to the side. \nMAGGIE I knew you'd be coming by. Today. \nGabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't. She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of memories. Maggie carves on a smile. \nMAGGIE If you're in that much of a hurry, why don't you ride with me? \nINT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY \nMaggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain range. Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. Both grope for a way to start the conversation. \nGABE This is new... \nMAGGIE It's a thermal scope -- picks up body heat of lost hikers -- \nGabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they fly over the snow. \nGABE Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, I guess. \nSo much for small talk. Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these mountains go by. Maggie breaks an awkward silence -- \nMAGGIE You could have said goodbye. \nGABE (shakes head) If I did, I'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasn't my fault. \nMAGGIE (angry) Today -- especially today -- you get to hear it again. The harness clip broke.  Cold stress -- one in a million equipment failure. You and Hal could have checked it from then till now and it still would have happened. (beat) You did everything right -- \nGABE -- If I did everything right, Susan Collins would still be alive. \nTHE HELICOPTER \nwhizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old country road. Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL. Maggie starts to land the copter, and as she does -- \nMATHESON We got word that somebody's been observing your currency shipments -- this load, the $5,000s -- over the last three deliveries. \nTRAVERS (laughs) There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe. (beat) This is the most protected shipment we've got -- and the most useless for a thief. Those bills aren't in circulation. You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the fuck would try? \nMatheson hands Travers a folder. \nMATHESON This guy might. \nWe look over Travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures -- and all of them show ERIC QUALEN. \nTRAVERS Who is he? \nMATHERS (patient) His name's Eric Qualen. One of the East German spies who got shut out by the reunification. The CIA issued an inter-agency warning about him right after the wall came down. He's got nowhere to go and nothing to lose. He's also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these -- and he's probably desperate enough to try for them. Fifty million bucks buys a lot of sanctuary. \nTRAVERS Could you get to the part where I'm supposed to care? \nMATHESON (shows him more photos) We had two agents monitoring him. These two -- Gleason and Quinones. Their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment. \nTRAVERS (turning away) Thanks for the tip. But I've got work to do. \nMATHESON (stopping him) Did I say \"last\" report? I think I did. I mean last fucking report. These guys have vanished. \nTRAVERS You have my sympathy, but -- (exasperated) There's a reason we do things this way, all right? Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight. The only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco. Either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards. \nMatheson still isn't convinced. \nTRAVERS If you're worried about an inside job, forget it. I checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago. And these three are my best against. Even if one of them did go skydiving, they wouldn't get far. Each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles. \nTravers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman out of his jacket pocket. The small screen shows three red blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases. \nTRAVERS (facing down Matheson) I haven't lost a bill in eight years. And I'm not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily. \nMATHESON (an easy smile) Who said anything about stopping the shipment? (beat) I've been tracking Qualen for almost a year. If he pulls something, I want to be in on the party. \nTravers, angry, turns to Wright. Wright clearly doesn't like this either, but is resigned to it. \nWRIGHT This is cleared from the top, Travers. Matheson will accompany you on the flight to San Francisco. (beat) Show him every professional courtesy. \nTravers turns back to a smiling Matheson, looking like he'd rather kill him instead, as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - MAGGIE'S HELICOPTER \nis being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow -- Maggie struggles hard with the controls, but -- \nINSIDE HELICOPTER \nVisibility is near zero. Maggie keys the radio. \nMAGGIE Rescue One to base, over. \nHAL (O.S.) Rescue One -- have you sighted them? Over -- \nMAGGIE Negative, Hal -- storm's already moving in -- I can't see them, and winds are too strong to stay up here -- over -- \nHAL (O.S.) Rescue One -- abort. They'll be all right. Brett and Evan are dumb enough not to log in, but they're smart enough to have storm gear. Head back to base. (not unkindly) Maybe you can catch Gabe before he leaves. Over. \nMAGGIE I don't think he's planning a long visit, Hal. (back to business) Rescue One heading back to base, over and out. \nTHE HELICOPTER \nbanks a 180 to fly back -- we can see over the horizon that the storm is moving in fast. \nINT. CAVE - DAY \nWe can hear Maggie's helicopter flying off overhead -- camped inside the cave are BRETT and EVAN, both 20s, both shivering, amid their gear -- backpacks, cooking stuff -- and parachutes. These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers who'll try anything if the odds are strong enough they'll die in the process. \nEVAN (freezing) Way to check the weather, Brett. \nBRETT (shivering yet macho) Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth d-doing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TREASURY JET (DC-9) - DAY \nThe DC-9 cruises over increasingly mountainous, remote terrain. \nINT. JET - CLOSE ON TRAVERS \nwho looks tense -- we MOVE AROUND the cabin and find two more relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the plane, their arms chained to the currency cases. Matheson is edgy. Another AGENT offers some condescending reassurance. \nAGENT Just enjoy the view, huh? (Matheson says nothing) Relax. I mean, what could happen in the air? \nMatheson turns back to his window and looks down -- \nWINDOW POV - THE GROUND BELOW \nis covered with snow -- the jet's shadow moves sleekly and plainly over it. But after a moment we see -- -- another jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast! \nINSIDE THE DC-9 - MATHESON \nreacts this and shifts his look upward to -- \nWINDOW POV - ANOTHER PLANE (GULFSTREAM) \nis flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet, and is just one hundred yards away. Close enough to see Eric Qualen's face in one of the windows. \nINSIDE THE PLANE \nMatheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too, and gets out of his seat as the other agents react. \nTRAVERS (to other agents) Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit! \nTravers moves into \nTHE COCKPIT \nTravers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot, one in a suit like Travers. \nPILOT This isn't going to work -- Wright will suspect something. \nTRAVERS So what. He'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm -- (gestures to bodies) -- find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty -- (finds three suitcases) -- and just enough of the right kind of ash. \nTravers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's thought of everything. \nTRAVERS We get twenty-one gun funerals and they write off fifty million. It's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady -- so concentrate. \nTravers moves back into the cabin. \nINSIDE QUALEN'S JET \nWe can now see four other passengers. All are fit and armed -- HELDON and RYAN are seated, while KYNETTE and DELMER, ready to help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door from a very impatient Qualen. \nQUALEN (into radio) Travers -- hurry it up. \nINSIDE TREASURY JET \nTravers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs the money cases from the agents. \nTRAVERS (into radio) On my way. \nTravers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch over and LED -- \nTHE LED \nstarts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 -- \nIN THE COCKPIT \nEven in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane is flying right into the blackest center of it. The pilot looks more panicked than ever. \nTRAVERS That charge is going to blow both engines -- the plane'll go down like a rock, so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as I get over. (an afterthought) And make sure you bring the right cases. \nTravers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the cable between the planes. \nTRAVERS (into the headset) Dip the plane. I'm coming over. \nTHE JETS - LONG SHOT \nQualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline -- Travers starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into \nQUALEN'S JET \nwhere he's pulled in and unclipped by Qualen. \nQUALEN (shouting over the wind) Why didn't you send the money over? \nTRAVERS (shouting too) Somehow, I didn't think you'd have waited for me if I'd sent it first. \nQualen smiles in reply. No. Maybe he wouldn't. \nIN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT \nThe pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin. \nTHE LED \ncounts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 -- \nIN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN \nThe pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of -- \nTHE AGENTS \nMatheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet. \nIN THE CABIN \nThe pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and SHOOTS the pilot in the back twice. \nTHE PILOT \ndrops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we can't hear it over the HOWLING of the storm -- \nIN QUALEN'S JET \nQualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel -- \nTRAVERS (shouting to cockpit) Get underneath the jet! The cases will slide over! \nTHE JETS - LONG SHOT \nQualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide over -- but at the same time -- \nINSIDE THE TREASURY JET \nMatheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and FIRES a full clip from his automatic at Qualen's jet -- and \nTHE LED \ncounts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- and \nTHE TREASURY JET'S ENGINES \nare destroyed as the charge DETONATES -- \nTHE JETS - LONG SHOT \nAs promised, the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes -- the cases dangle precariously on the wire -- \nINSIDE QUALEN'S JET \nTRAVERS (shouting) Lower! Get underneath it! \nTHE PLANE \nwrenches to a sudden halt, the fuselage intact. \nWIDER VIEW - THE PLANE \nor what's left of it has stopped several feet short of the edge -- we can see why: the steel cable, trailing from the cargo door, has lashed itself around a half dozen trees, acting as a tripwire to stop the plane. \nINSIDE THE PLANE \nQuiet. All are dazed but, outside of superficial cuts, unhurt. Kristel moves out of the cockpit, looking around. \nKRISTEL So much for phase one. (to Travers) Now what? \nShe speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething Qualen. Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases. The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers have survived the fall. \nTRAVERS Now -- we call the police. \nINT. RANGER STATION - DAY \nHal, agitated, paces in the main office -- Frank, unconcerned, puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little TV to drag in the fading signal of a Broncos game. \nHAL Look -- I know there's a storm, but that wasn't thunder. \nFRANK (unconcerned) Hal, when you've been in this line as long as I have -- \nThe station's scanner radio barks to life. \nKRISTEL (O.S.) (panicky) Mayday -- mayday -- downed DC-3 -- mayday -- \nHal runs to the radio and keys the mike. \nHAL Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, mayday -- \nINT. COCKPIT \nKristel is on the radio, as Travers and Qualen hang back. Kristel's voice is panicked but she can't suppress a grin. \nKRISTEL Downed charter flight alpha-charlie-niner-- (keys mike to \"garble\" transmission) -- dead, seven seriously wounded, acknowledge -- \nINT. RANGER STATION \nHAL Acknowledged, mayday. What's your position? \nKRISTEL (O.S.) (\"panicked\") Don't know -- position unknown -- landed on top of some mountain -- only visual bearing is a facing cylinder-type formation -- over -- \nHAL Got to be Comb Bluff. (keys mike) Acknowledged, mayday. Winds are too strong for us to get a copter up there -- can you and your passengers make it through the storm? Over -- \nKRISTEL (O.S. Negative -- cockpit is on fire -- fuselage broken into three sep-- (\"garble\") --ed in shock.  Need medical supplies, including insulin, repeat, insulin, as soon as po -- \nDead silence. The transmission cuts off/ \nHAL Mayday -- come in, mayday -- \nINT. COCKPIT \nKristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen standing behind her. Qualen lightly applauds. \nQUALEN Not bad. The insulin was a nice touch. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nThe Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming finally to a cabin settled in a clearing. \nGABE \npulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park. He doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's going in or not. Finally -- he cuts the ignition. \nINT. CABIN - DAY \nA knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside. \nGABE Maggie? \nNo answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.  Gabe smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at the back of the cabin shakes him out of it. \nEXT. CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR \nhas come open and swings in the wind. Gabe steps outside and pulls it shut. Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a small but sturdy shed a few yards away. Gabe heads over to it. \nINT. SHED - DAY \nNot a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off. \nA LARGE PLASTIC CAGE \n-- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing. \nMAGGIE Hey there -- \nThe door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just looks awkward. \nGABE Hi. (beat) Could you introduce us? \nMAGGIE Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27. A27 -- Gabe. \nGABE Not the tag -- what do you call him? \nMAGGIE Her. I call her Lucky. \nGABE (bends down, eyes wound) Poachers? (Maggie nods) Bastards... \nMAGGIE They got the mother -- and left this one behind. Too small to make a decent trophy, I guess. \nGABE About four months, right? (Maggie nods) Christ -- it must have been just about his -- I mean her -- first flight -- \nMAGGIE Time to change the dressing. \nIce, building in a small crevase, builds and CRACKS the adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall, causing a chain reaction \nROCKSLIDE \nthat bounces down the wall -- \nGABE \nhugs the ice wall, making himself as flat as possible -- \nGABE (shouting down) Rockslide! \nHAL \nflattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring piton LOOSENS as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe -- \nTHE PITON - CLOSE \nalso has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the unreliable ice -- \nHAL \ntries to stay flat, but one boulder painfully CLIPS him on the shoulder, knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls -- \nWIDER - HAL FALLING \nIn falling, Hal's weight on the rope yanks out the nearest anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space, keeping pace with the boulders, as -- \nGABE \nwho's seen everything we have, quickly reaches to the piton he's just anchored, and removes the carabiner clip -- \nHAL - FALLING \nThe rope draws taut, yanking out the last piton between he and Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now -- \nGABE \nhas the bolt gun out. He rapidly hooks the rope's carabiner clip to the chambered bolt, and FIRES it at a solid rock ledge above him -- \nINSERT - THE BOLT \nimbeds solidly in the rock -- \nGABE \nlashes the rope to his shoulder, bracing for the coming impact by lodging his feet in the ice -- \nTHE JOLT - WIDER SHOT \nThe line pulls taut, leaving Hal suspended, the wind knocked out of him from the impact -- \nGABE \nis almost dragged down by the jolt -- he painfully takes most of the impact in his shoulders -- the shock forces his feet through an ice ledge -- but the rope, bolted to the rock above, has held. Barely. \nGABE (shaken, voice gone) Anchored -- (shouts this time) Anchored! \nHAL \nnow somewhat recovered, steadies himself. \nHAL (breathless too) You're sure this time -- \nHal climbs up the rope, finally reaching another ledge slightly below Gabe's. Hal leans against the wall, gasping, as Gabe clips the gun to his pack. \nHAL (looking up at gun) Don't say it -- \nGABE (wheezing too) It's kind of hard to resist -- \nGABE                         HAL It's not dead                It's not dead weight -- you                weight -- I am. are. \nHal and Gabe start howling -- that hysterical, giddy laugh that only comes from just missing a violent end. \nWIDE SHOT ON MOUNTAIN - THE TWO LEDGES \nHal and Gabe's friendship is starting to resurface -- their LAUGHTER is nearly louder than the wind, as we -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PRECIPICE EDGE - DAY - BINOCULAR POV \nFrom the top of the bluff, someone is looking down through binoculars -- Gabe and Hal's orange jackets are plainly visible a few hundred yards below. \nRYAN \nlowers the binoculars, and keys an ear button on the headset radio he's wearing, sending a beep. \nINSIDE THE PLANE \nTravers is wearing another headset -- the others are just resting in the seats \nTRAVERS (into mouthpiece) Have they arrived? (two beeps in response) Good. Return to the plane and cover your tracks. \nQUALEN (to others) Get ready. \nON THE MOUNTAIN BELOW \nHal and Gabe are tired, but get a second wind from the excitement of being almost on top. Gabe stops, breathless for a second, then goes on. Hal lags a little behind. \nGABE Come on -- the hard part's over. \nGabe heads up and over \nTHE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE/CRASH SITE \nand helps Hal up. From here, the rest of the range looms large. Even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular sight -- but Gabe and Hal don't pause to enjoy it. This isn't a trip for sport. Hal looks off into the trees, and sees the torn tree stumps from the plane crash. \nHAL Sure. All the bullets we can eat. \nGABE That's not what really worries me. \nHAL There's something else to worry about? \nGABE Yeah. Once they've got what they're after -- they're gonna need a copter to get out of here. \nHAL (realizing) Maggie. \nGabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up. The rest keep pace. \nTHE WALL \nThe climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide. Travers takes out the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is just above them. \nTRAVERS Hold it. (beat) It's up there. \n\"UP THERE\" - AN OVERHANG \njuts out of the wall fifty feet above their position. As the rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge. \nBut this isn't easily accessible -- we MOVE DOWN from the overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow. Worse, the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making climbing almost impossible. \nON THE LEDGE \nTravers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up \nTRAVERS Fetch. \nGABE I'll need the ice axe. \nTRAVERS (laughs) You've got to be kidding. \nGABE (sighs) Okay. How about some tape? \nTravers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabe's confiscated pack and throws it to him. \nGABE Crampons too. \nTravers hesitates, but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron spikes. Gabe fastens them to his boots. \nGabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him. In spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and his fingers. \nHIGH ANGLE - GABE \nmoves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet up, there's nothing. To keep going, Gabe has to painfully wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment. We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet from solid ground. We can see from his face that he's trying not to think about it. \nON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN \nwatch Gabe's slow progress. \nQUALEN I don't trust him. \nTRAVERS (indicating wall) Where could he go? \nQUALEN I'd rather he didn't show us. (beat) We don't need two guides. \nTRAVERS (shrugs) You win. Kill him when he gets down. \nGABE ON THE WALL - CLOSE \nMake that \"if he comes down\". Gabe is now in one of the worst positions possible for a free climb. He is moving up the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support. It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock again and again. Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice -- some of the ice chips whistle past and down -- \n-- finally, Gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls himself onto \nTHE OVERHANG \nExhausted, Gabe pulls himself prone across the top. Something hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow off the money case that's underneath. It's battered from the fall, but is still barely holding together. Gabe manages to force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case, and fingers a band of $5000s. \nGABE Jesus. \nON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN \nlook up. They can see Gabe has made it -- but they can't see him, or the case. \nTRAVERS (impatient, shouting) Lower it down -- now! \nON THE OVERHANG - GAB \nhas no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice and snow above. \nON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN'S POV \ntry to look up and locate Gabe. They can't. Until -- \nGABE (O.S.) (shouting down) I've got a better idea. Why don't you come up and get it? \nWith the case, Gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualen's point of view. Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain bulges out as it goes up. Gabe's got a slight edge of cover. \nTRAVERS (shouts to Heldon) Get him! \nHeldon runs along the lower ledge, FIRING up at -- \nGABE \nwho has to flatten against the upper ledge -- bullets howl past at twenty per second, SPARKING against the lip of the rock -- it's cover, but not much -- \nHAL \nlooks up, worried -- \nHAL'S POV - ICE AND SNOW \npiled by the ton from the storm, lie further above -- the ice holding it back already, already weakened by the sun, is being chiselled away by bullets -- \nON THE LOWER LEDGE - QUALEN \nIt's a crevice in the mountain, about two feet wide -- a climber would call this a \"chimney\" -- and it's packed with ice and snow. It's also packed with \nGABE \n-- his hand gropes out -- and with some difficulty, he digs himself out, gasping and coughing. Gabe, coated with snow, leans against the wall and rests. Alive. \nINT. RANGER STATION - DAY \nMaggie is on the phone, pacing, as Frank is slumped in front of the radio scanner. Suddenly, the radio comes to life. \nHAL (O.S.) -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over -- \nMaggie bolts over to the radio before Frank can react. \nMAGGIE (keying mike) Rescue Unit -- what's going on, Hall? -- over -- \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - DAY \nTravers has his gun pressed to Hal's temple. \nTRAVERS No tricks, no procedural codes, no personal messages -- just tell them everything's under control and you're taking care of the wounded. \nHAL (keys it) We've reached the wreckage -- top of Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're responding to treatment. Everything A-OK. Over. \nMAGGIE (O.S.) Everything isn't okay, Hal -- I'm coming up after you -- over -- \nHAL Negative, Maggie. Winds are too high, and the passengers' injuries are all superficial. We're going to ride out the storm here -- over -- \nTravers yanks away the radio. \nTRAVERS Have her come up. \nHAL Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her all over the peaks -- (Travers starts to argue) -- Not that I expect you to give a shit, but it's our only copter. You'll be stuck. \nTravers relents and hands the radio back. \nMAGGIE (O.S.) I can handle the winds -- \nHAL (breaking in) Forget about it, Maggie, that's an order -- acknowledge -- \nINT. RANGER STATION \nMaggie looks out the window. The station's windspeed gauge is flying around so fast it looks like it might take off. \nMAGGIE Acknowledged. Let me talk to Gabe -- over -- \nHAL (O.S.) (hesitates) You can't. He's taking care of passengers. Just like I should be. Over and out. \nMaggie leans back in the chair, looks out at the storm, and tries not to worry. She fails miserably. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - TRAVERS AND HAL \nTRAVERS (snatching radio away) Good. You might live longer than your friend. Now -- (takes out monitor) -- what? \nHal takes the monitor -- the next blip is above, almost straight up. Hal motions to the wooded area ahead. \nHAL The next one's on top of the peak. This'll be long, but easy -- more like a hike than a climb. \nTRAVERS (suspicious) It looks like a winding route. \nHAL There's a more direct route. The East Face. But it's the wall on the other side, and it's smooth as glass. Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather. Only a psycho would try it in a snowstorm. \nTravers digests this, and motions Hal to move on as we -- \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - GABE'S FACE \nis torn in pain. In spite of the cold and wind, he's drenched in sweat, half exertion, half fear. We pull back to take in \nTHE EAST WALL - LONG SHOT \nEnvision a wall. A really big wall. A really, really big wall. A wall that's as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit. \nNow picture the same wall, checkered with ice. If this were horizontal, you or I couldn't walk on it without falling. \nNow picture the same wall with an orange dot, two-thirds of the way up it. The orange dot is \nGABE \nand he barely has the strength to hold on, much less go up. Gabe holds himself steady with one hand, gets a foothold, and swings another hand up to SLAM it against the wall. \nHe's improvised gear -- he's tied a crampon to one hand. But it's as awkward as it sounds. Gabe moves up only a foot or so -- then pulls out the crampon, reaches up, and SLAMS it into the wall, starting the painful process over again. \nCUT TO; \nINT. DENVER MINT - WRIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY \nWright's pacing around, trying to figure out what in his office he should break first. Davis shows up at the door. \nWRIGHT (furious) Okay -- I know it's not in San Francisco. I know it's not here. I know it's not in any fucking airport from here to Montana. Where it's not - we got that covered. Now, do you have any ideas on where it is? \nDAVIS (walking to a map) There's no radio contact, sir. At all. We're not receiving the tracer signal from the cockpit's flight recorder. Radar lost it after it went low here. \nHe points to a huge part of Colorado. Hundreds of square miles. \nDAVIS We have to assume it went down in the storm. \nWRIGHT Air search? \nDAVIS (shakes head) That storm hasn't quit yet. Weather service says we've got it until tomorrow morning at least. Even if we could get a plane up now, it'd be impossible to see anything on the ground. And -- \nWright slumps into a chair. \nWRIGHT -- The roads are shut down, right? \nDAVIS Most of this area doesn't even have roads. \nTHE MONITOR \nwhich shows he's practically on top of the case -- finally \nTRAVERS \nshoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches. \nTRAVERS (calling behind) It's over here! \nTravers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the light -- but something's wrong -- Qualen comes up behind Travers and shines the light on \nA SNOWMAN \ncute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five-pebble smile, as well as Douglas' cap, in a clearing. The still blinking, still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman. The case is leaned up against it. \nTravers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it. It's empty -- except for a single $5000 bill. Travers picks it up -- scrawled on the margin is \"LET'S TRADE.\" \nTRAVERS (incredulous) He's still alive. (furious) He's still alive! (to Qualen and the others) He can't be far away -- spread out! \nQualen, Kynette, Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods, each with a flashlight and a fun. Ryan, however, straps on nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight. \nTRAVERS (to Hal, brandishing gun) Put your hands on your head. \nELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE \nwatches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage point -- he can see the flashlight beams, all headed in the wrong direction. But he doesn't see \nRYAN - \"NIGHTFINDER\" POV \nWith these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold -- this isn't one of those infra-red, thermo-blob jobs -- it looks more like day for night photography. Even starlight is enough for Ryan to run easily through the thick woods -- and he's going in the right direction. \nGABE \nbegins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer to where Travers is holding Hal -- before he can get far -- \n\"NIGHTFINDER\" POV - RYAN \nlooks up, and can clearly see Gabe climbing down the small rock, twenty yards distant -- \nRYAN \nsmiles, looking macabre under the goggles, and opens fire -- \nGABE \nis startled as the bullets impact inches over his head -- he jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as he hits the ground -- more bullets hit where Gabe was a split second ago -- \nRYAN \nchases Gabe, easily maneuvering through the trees -- \nGABE \nruns too, trying to dodge Ryan's continuing fusillades -- Gabe knows this territory, but to him, it's still pitch dark -- he stumbles, and rams against trees -- \nRYAN \nkeeps coming up behind, closing the hap, Gabe's bright form just ahead -- \nGABE \ncomes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the summit. All that's beneath him is \nGABE'S POV \n-- a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice. No escape route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all the way to the ground far below. \nGABE \nis driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the sole source of cover. \nELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT \nKristel, Qualen and Kynette, having heard the gunshots, are now rushing to Gabe's position -- \nRYAN \nalmost casually emerges from the woods. He can see there is nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder. He walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world. \nGABE \nfumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of sterno. Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan -- \nRYAN - \"NIGHTFINDER\" POV - THE FLARE \narcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything into a blinding, agonizing flash of white -- \nRYAN \nSCREAMS, putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them off -- \nGABE \nbolts out from behind the boulder to rush him -- \nRYAN \ninstantly aware of what Gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off -- \nGABE \njust runs straight ahead to Ryan, getting to him before the machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men fall to the ground, and -- \nThe machine gun CLATTERS away, landing on the edge of the ice, just out of reach -- Ryan, now recovered from the blinding flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun, grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe, slamming into him -- the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryan's hit also carries both Gabe and Ryan over the edge, onto -- \nTHE ICE SLOPE \nDAVIS Not yet -- \nWRIGHT (heading to the door) Get the copters ready. We take off in three minutes. \nDAVIS The winds are still too strong -- \nWRIGHT Sorry to hear it. We're still going. The plane might be intact. \nWright drags the protesting Davis out the door. \nDAVIS Sir -- \nWRIGHT Shut up. That fifty million isn't coming out of my pension. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - DAY \nTravers, Qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the shack, a little groggy. Odds are no one got much sleep. \nTravers shoves Hal toward a sketchy \"YOU ARE HERE\" map of the mountain range, and hands him the tracer monitor. \nTRAVERS Still interested in staying alive? \nHal matches the monitor to the map -- the blip is higher up. \nHAL (pointing to map) It's up here. Somewhere on the Tower. There's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day. \nTRAVERS Show me. \nTravers shoves Hal forward -- the others follow. \nELSEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN/SUMMIT - BINOCULAR POV \nFrom about fifty yards off, someone watches Hal lead the gang away from the shack. \nBRETT (O.S.) They're heading toward the opposite edge. An easy way down. \nBRETT AND EVAN \nare crouched in the woods. Brett, gun in hand, has no idea how far out of his league he is. Evan looks like he's having second thoughts, but he can't hack down now. \nBRETT I'll cut around this side, and wind up in front. You come up behind them -- quietly. And we've got 'em. \nEVAN Brett -- they've got five guns -- \nBRETT And you can collect them all after I get the drop on 'em. Let's get moving. \nBrett, automatic held high, circles off through the woods. Evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment. \nBELOW - GABE'S CAVE \nGabe pulls his jacket on -- reversed, with the grey lining out, so the orange won't make him so easy to spot -- and starts out towards the facing Tower -- his route, clearly, is going to be along the rock wall. It's relatively sheer, but there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy. \nMOUNTAIN TOP/SUMMIT - BRETT \nraces quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal, who's guiding the hang. Brett circles around ahead of them, waiting. Before he can jump out -- \nHAL'S POV - ON BRETT \nhiding ahead in the trees and rocks. \nHAL \nmakes eye contact with Brett, realizes what he's doing, and shakes his head as violently as he dares -- no, don't -- \nBRETT \ngives Hal a confident wink in response, then pounces in front of the gang, gun held high. \nBRETT End of the line! \nTravers, Delmer, Kristel and Kynette are startled, but don't immediately comply. This throws Brett off his stride. \nBRETT (nervous now) You heard me! Drop the guns! \nTravers smiles and steps closer to Brett. The others walk up in front of Hal. Travers actually laughs. \nTRAVERS \"End of the line\"? That's classic. (beat) You've got style. So, I'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off. \nBrett doesn't even look down -- he responds by FIRING a short burst over Travers' head. \nBRETT Nice try. I've got one of these at home. Now drop 'em. \nAll drop their guns -- Brett, unfortunately, realizes at the same time we do -- \nBRETT Hey -- where's the other guy -- \nHAL (shouting) Brett, behind you! \nToo late -- Brett can only twist around half way before -- \nQUALEN \neasily mows down Brett with his machine gun, riddling him with at least thirty rounds at close range. Brett falls dead into the snow. Qualen walks up to Brett's corpse, blood steaming in the reddening snow, and kicks it over. \nBELOW ON THE WALLSIDE \nGabe, reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire, climbs up, but there's nothing he can do -- \nTRAVERS AND QUALEN \nand the others pick up their guns. \nTRAVERS (turning to face Hal) Time to -- \nTravers sees that Hal is gone -- he's escaped in the confusion. \nIN THE WOODS - HAL \nturns away -- he can't watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces and looks up with absolute hate at \nTRAVERS \nwho doesn't see Gabe -- he's laughing at Evan's desperation, which ends as his death scream is cut off. \nHal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members behind him. Hal looks as angry as Gabe. \nQUALEN Was that Walker? \nTRAVERS No such luck. (to Hal, smiling) Cheer up. Everyone should die in a spot this beautiful. \nON THE LEDGE BELOW - CLOSE ON GABE \nwho has heard this and is shaking with fury. \nGABE (quietly) Don't worry. You will. \nLONG SHOT OF MOUNTAIN \nOn top, Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below, we can see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges. \nEXT. RANGER STATION - HELIPAD - DAY \nWinds or not, Maggie is untying the helicopter's rotor from the bolts on the helipad. Frank, who has obviously just awakened, rushes out of the station. \nFRANK Maggie -- what are you doing -- \nMAGGIE I'm going to go nuts if I sit here one more hour. \nFRANK Still a little breezy out, Mag -- \nMaggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor. \nMAGGIE (over engine's whine) You coming? \nFrank hesitates, but climbs in the other side. The helicopter lifts off and heads toward the mountain range. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - AERIAL SHOT - DAY \nThe next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a buttress -- a large, stark boulder formation -- that lays between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest mountain to it: the Tower. This is lower down from the summit -- it's solid and treeless. \nHal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they climb in single file up to the top. Terrain is flat enough that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours. \nCLOSER ON HAL AND GANG \nHal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious glances back at them. And beyond them. Travers notices this. \nTRAVERS Forget about it. He's smart, but he's not invisible. \nHal looks back. Travers is right. There's absolutely no way Gabe can come up behind them without being seen. \nLOWER DOWN ON BLUFF \nwhere the bluff meets a tree-lined plain. Gabe, in hiding, watches Hal and the others go up. No, he can't follow them up the bluff's side without being seen. But Gabe moves closer to the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the beginning of \nTHE \"CHIMNEY\" \nA crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff. \nGABE \npulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack. \nGABE'S POV - THE CHIMNEY \nStarting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a zig-zag, not a straight line. \nPicture a mine shaft designed by a madman. The crack moves upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again. The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to six feet. And that's just how it looks on the outside. There's no telling what the interior is like. \nGabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. It's hard to see much -- it's very, very dark. But it looks as if the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all the way up it. On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the mountain instead of going up the side. \nGABE \nputs away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack, starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the mountain formation. \nEXT. COLORADO WILDERNESS - PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY \nA frenzy of activity, as several dozen Treasury agents sift through the snow for the wreckage of the CT-39, some taking photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into bags for analysis. Many bags. Many small bags. \nWIDER ON CRASH SITE \nThe Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a paperback book. \nWRIGHT \nunhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the FAA -- ROSS STUART (40s) -- who is organizing the debris. \nWRIGHT What can you confirm? \nSTUART Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can confirm. (condescending) We've been here just about one hour. These events take months to analyze. So if you'll excuse me -- \nHe walks away -- but Wright, pissed, spins him around. \nWRIGHT No, I don't think I will. The reason the FAA pays you is to exercise your vast, amazing knowledge of these \"events\". So I expect you to come up with some stunning insights, something a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't already observed. (gesturing to wreckage) One: it didn't blow up in mid-air, because the debris isn't widely dispersed. But was there a bomb on board that could have disabled it? I wonder. (pointing back) Two: There wasn't an attempted landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris to the east of the wreckage, where the plane was coming from. Did it come straight down? That's got me scratching my head too. (gesturing back to wreckage) And three: the flight recorder's tracer led us here in the first place. So where is the goddamn thing? That one's got me all aflush with curiosity. \nSTUART (a little cowed) You'll be the first to know. \nWRIGHT Oh, I believe you. \nWright storms off as agents delicately handle debris. \nEXT. TOP OF THE BLUFF/VISTA - DAY \nA vista. From this point, you can see everything else in the mountain range. The only thing left that's taller is the Tower, a hundred yards away. Between the two mountains lies a drop of a mere four thousand feet. \nHal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge. Travers approaches him, furious. \nGABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN \n-- bullets are RICOCHETING all over -- Gabe throws himself over Maggie to shield her. \nKYNETTE \ncan't see what he's shooting at, so he mercifully stops. Seeing the rope, he bends down to climb after them -- \nGABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN \nGabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice -- \nKYNETTE - REACHING FOR THE ROPE \n-- which is tied in a standard climber's slipknot and comes undone with a final tug -- the rope, freed of the piton, falls down, but Kynette firmly grabs hold of the end -- \nGABE \nfeels the rope go taut -- he yanks the rope down hard -- \nKYNETTE \ngets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall into the crack, disappearing with a scream -- Qualen has just arrived in time to see this -- \nGABE \nlooks over as Kynette bounces past him, a few feet away -- the rope goes slack in his hand as Kynette falls below. \nUP ABOVE - QUALEN \nin frustration, FIRES a burst straight down into the crack -- \nGABE AND MAGGIE - IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe and Maggie move laterally through the crack -- now about thirty feet from where they started, so ricochets are a serious but decreasing problem. \nThe crack narrows from five to three feet. Gabe edges Maggie down into it, and along a ledge moving to the side. \nGABE This way. (off Maggie's look) I like the outside of the mountain better too, but -- \nGabe and Maggie move along the ledge -- \nQUALEN \nis still at the edge of the crack -- stymied. He's definitely not climbing down after them -- he pulls back from the edge. \nIN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE \nfind a comparative point of comfort -- a toe-sized ledge. Maggie is moving ahead of Gabe. \nGABE Stop. \nMAGGIE We can't -- \nGABE I need to stop. \nExhausted, Gabe braces himself against the wall. \nGABE (looks at Maggie) I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I wish you hadn't come. \nEXT. WIRE CROSSING - TOWER SIDE - DAY \nQualen whizzes across the wire on the harness, easily making it to where Hal, Travers and Kristel are waiting. \nTRAVERS Don't tell me -- \nQUALEN (disengaging) He's still alive. \nTravers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt with Hal's axe. Qualen grabs his arm before he can take a third swing -- and looks at his watch. \nQUALEN For another two minutes. \nIN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE \nGabe catches his breath. All this is taking its toll on him. \nMAGGIE It hurts just looking at you. \nGABE (still panting) Try it from this side. Do you still have your radio? \nMAGGIE It's not going to work in here. \nGABE Let's give it a try. (she hands it to him) I'm in bad need of a ride. (keys it) Come in, Rescue Unit -- \nEXT. TOWER FACE - DAY \nHal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge -- the radio, in Travers' pack, comes to life. \nGABE (O.S.) (over radio) -- Come in, Rescue One -- \nTravers stares daggers at Qualen. Qualen looks to his watch. \nQUALEN Patience. \nINT. RESCUE STATION \nThe radio is reading Gabe loud, if not clear -- the interference of solid rock is garbling it. But we can see out the window that Frank is now between radios, carefully hauling Evan's body from the helicopter to the station on a collapsible gurney. No one else is in the station. \nGABE (O.S.) (over radio, broken up) -- Come in, Frank -- \nINT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe, exasperated, stops for a moment. \nGABE Is there anybody else on the radio? \nMaggie shakes her head no. \nDAVIS I've got something here. \nSTUART Let's have it. \nDAVIS There's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed. \nSTUART That's really, really interesting, but (gestures around) -- kind of old news, don't you think? \nDAVIS This call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed. After it landed. \nSTUART (waves it off) Sounds like they got it wrong. Next time you interrupt my work make sure it's something I can use. \nINT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge -- finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they round a corner. \nGABE (smiling) Come on -- we're almost out. \nThe crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on the opposite edge to walk faster. But before he can go on -- \nA HAND \ngrabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down -- Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of \nKYNETTE \nbruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made his way out. His look is not a forgiving one. \nKYNETTE Miss me? \nKynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled punch -- \nGABE \nfalls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up -- \nKYNETTE \ncalmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its brass-knuckle handle. \nTOWER FACE \nThe gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from seeing where the crack actually comes out. \nQUALEN (looks to Hal) You might say a few words for your friends -- this is the one that will bury them. \nBOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT \nReady to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 -- \nIN THE CRACK - MAGGIE \ncan only look down helplessly at \nGABE AND KYNETTE \nfighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking backwards in the dark isn't east. \nGabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than Kynette. \nGabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power to it. Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch -- Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the crack walls -- which are now four feet apart. Kynette moves in for the kill. \nBOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT \nThe LED counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't detonate. A green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't gone off. \nIN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY \nKynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife -- But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall, trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle. \nGabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton. \nTOWER FACE \nQualen's smirk is wiped off his face. The bomb didn't work? \nTRAVERS What happened? \nQUALEN I'm not sure -- I set the timer -- \nQualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach. Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the radio. \nHAL (keying radio) Gabe, it's a dud -- \nBut the second Hal transmits -- \nBOMB NUMBER TWO \ndetonates over the central part of the crevice, and as promised, it's even bigger than the first -- \nINSIDE THE CRACK \nThe bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice -- \nGABE AND MAGGIE \nThe RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable -- Gabe shoves Maggie forward -- \nGABE Move! \nMaggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances, this \"running\" looks damn slow -- \nKYNETTE \nstruggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off the wall and buries him instantly -- \nGABE AND MAGGIE \nwhere Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope. Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third case, which took a tough landing on one rock -- it's shattered into halves, and the bands of $5000s are scattered around in the snow. \nGabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the cash -- soaked by the snow, they've frozen into ice bricks. As Gabe stuffs them into his pack, he's startled by something coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face \nA RABBIT \nthat's landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than Gabe was. Gabe leans back, relieved. For now. \nEXT. FURTHER UP ON SLOPE - HAL AND GANG \nare closer now -- but as they move down, Hal freezes in place as he sees the \"Bitker\" sign some distance ahead. The sign is out of place. A signal from Gabe -- he is alive. And here. \nQualen and the others check the monitor. Hal takes the opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly, subtly wedge something into a crack behind his back -- \nINSERT - THE OBJECT \nis what Hal lifted off Frank's body -- a speed load cylinder from a revolver, with six fresh bullets in it. \nQUALEN \nchecks the monitor -- the relative position shows they're -- \nQUALEN Almost there. \n-- but Qualen's grin is wiped away as he looks down at -- \nTHE MONITOR \n-- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their position! \nQUALEN'S \nface shifts from incredulity to realization to rage. \nAll eyes are on the monitor -- Hal, at the rock formation, has one hand behind his back. \nINSERT - HAL'S HAND \nshakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with his thumbnail -- \nHAL \nmoves away from the rock, to draw their attention from what he's been doing -- \nHAL Oh, no -- you didn't lose another one, did you? \nDelmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs into the woods, guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows. Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint. Hal deliberately moves in a semi-circle, putting Delmer's back to the rocks. \nDELMER What about him? \nQUALEN (over his shoulder) Kill him! Now! \nDelmer grins as he aims at Hal. \nDELMER Tell me -- where would you like the first half dozen shots to go? \nINSERT - THE MATCH \nhas burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box, which is behind the speed load cylinder -- \nHAL AND DELMER \nHAL (hands up) As long as you're taking requests -- how about -- the base of your spine? \nDelmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger -- Hal tenses up, it's now or never -- \nINSERT - THE MATCH \nburns down to the box, igniting all the matches -- \nON DELMER \nas there is the sudden sound of six distinct, consecutive gunshots behind him -- the fire's blasted the powder in all the bullets. Delmer, startled, spins around and FIRES up, FIRES down, FIRES across -- by the time he realizes no one's there and he turns back around to find -- \n-- Hal is gone, vanished into the woods. \nFOLLOWING QUALEN \nthrough the woods -- up a slope, around a tree, down another slope -- his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip that's zig-zagging just ahead of him. \nQUALEN (tagging headset radio) Travers. Get down here. Now. \nTRAVERS \nis trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes. \nTRAVERS Have you found the money? \nQUALEN (O.S.) No. Walker has. \nTravers, furious, flings the door aside, jumps into the copter and starts the rotor. \nQUALEN \nis running alone, following the monitor lead -- until he sees a band of $5000s in the snow. Sure he's on the right track, Qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too. But we can see that behind him and higher up -- \nGABE \nwho is on a rise behind a rock, watches Qualen's futile pursuit from a distance, amused. Amused, until -- \nKRISTEL You would have lived longer, if you weren't such a smartass. \nGabe spins his head around -- and his temple smacks into Kristel's gun barrel. \nKRISTEL You telegraphed this kind of stunt with that joke snowman. Too bad for you we're not all gullible. \nKristel starts to squeeze the trigger. \nFIRES until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the tree line as his target comes out, skidding to a stop in the snow. Travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look but is shocked to see \nDELMER - ON \"SLED\" \nDelmer's highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it finally skids to a dead halt. \nCLOSE ON TRAVERS \nwho is apoplectic -- he's just shot one of his own men. \nHAL (O.S.) (over radio) Thanks loads. (beat) I couldn't have killed him without you. \nTravers looks down at the heat scope -- blank. \nHAL \nis hiding his body \"heat\" under a rock formation. \nIN HELICOPTER \nStymied, Travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area and circles around the mountain's other side. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - SLOPING GRADE - GABE AND KRISTEL \nGabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain edge, ahead of Kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back. \nKRISTEL How much further? \nGABE (stops) It's right over there. \nGabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a \nA SHED \nthat is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant across a snowy plateau. \nGABE AND KRISTEL \nGABE It's a storage locker for the rangers. Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there -- skiis, food -- I'll show you -- \nGabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this -- \nKRISTEL Don't move. \nKristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun trained on him as she crunches through the snow. \nKRISTEL Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too, right? (moves backward) Keep walking. Not too close. \nGABE We'd make better time walking straight ahead. Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer. \nKRISTEL (walking backward) Right. So I'd better have one less problem when he arrives. \nGABE (knowing this means him) Don't fuck up. You still need me to show you a route off the mountain. \nKRISTEL You've worn that one out, Walker -- (snaps back bolt) -- I'll find my own way down. \nKristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe, but her feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- -- Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it collapses under her -- she's pulling the trigger and SHOTS go wild as she sinks and sinks -- \nON GABE \nwho's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land, Kristel's SHOTS arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles around him -- but he bellies ahead as -- \nON THE SNOWDRIFT'S TOP \nKristel's GUNSHOTS slow, and finally, stop, the very last of them loosening the snow around -- \nTHE \"SHED\" \nthat was obscured by snow was a tall, three-sided park service sign shouting \"WARNING -- SNOWDRIFT -- DO NOT CROSS\" in eight different languages. The rest of the snow falls away from it, revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow. \nGABE \nbellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the ice axe's staff -- only when he hits something solid with it does he get back up to his feet. But the sound of ice-crusted snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that -- \nQUALEN \nhas just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's gun BLAZES down -- \nGABE \nis on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into \nA THICK WOODED AREA \nwhich is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in seconds. Gabe looks down the slope. Running is impractical. So he sits down. \nQUALEN \narrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope -- \nQUALEN'S POV - GABE \nis whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder. Alpinists call this a \"sitting glissade\". Colorado climbers call it \"butt skiing\". Some psychos do this for fun. \nGABE'S POV - THE SLIDE \nis anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and out of trees and boulders in his path -- \nQUALEN \nstarts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at -- \nGABE \nwho tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down -- \n-- to the slope's bottom. Gabe painfully lifts himself up and moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to \nGabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with Qualen's machine gun is floating by. Gabe snatches up the gun and pulls the trigger. Nothing but an empty CLICK. \nQUALEN Far more intimidating when it's loaded. \nThe chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around, Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away -- \nWIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT \nis nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice raft, it will definitely upend it -- \nQUALEN AND GABE \nstay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen swings out at Gabe with the axe. Gabe ducks and tries to go low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into -- \nTHE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT \n-- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade -- \nGABE \nquickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by digging his crampons in -- just as -- \nQUALEN \nrealizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach. Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left -- \n-- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn into the vortex -- \nGABE \nstruggles to his feet and looks down, wincing -- \nGABE'S POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN \nQualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond -- \nQUALEN'S POV - UNDERWATER \nQualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the lake's tunnel drain -- \nON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL \nBLASTS OUT full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a half a mile to the ground below! \nGABE \nhas no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves him moments from the same fate. One more time around, and it's down the drain. Gabe takes a deep breath. No choice. He leaps -- \nWIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING \n-- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake -- \nGABE \nlands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. No choice -- Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's weakened -- Gabe slides off, but -- \nA HAND \nreaches down and grabs him -- \nHAL \npulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge. Gabe's surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's. \nHAL (eyeing Gabe's ruined shirt) Nice outfit. (hands him his parka) I know you never liked the orange, but \nGABE Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either. That's why I quit. (pulls on parka) You all right? \nHAL I feel better than you look. I can live with that. \nGabe looks down at the parka -- it's completely full of bullet holes. \nGABE Hardly seems worth zipping, huh? (serious now) Frank? \nHal sobers -- shakes his head no. A cloud passes over Gabe's face. \nHAL It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the helicopter. \nINSIDE HELICOPTER - FLYING ELSEWHERE OVER MOUNTAIN \nMaggie's hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopter's roof. Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter. \nTRAVERS (into radio) Qualen -- Kristel -- come in -- \nHAL AND GABE ON BRIDGE \nGabe hears Hal's borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds his hand out to Hal. \nGABE May I? (dons it, keys it) They can't talk right now, Travers. Kristel's busy making snow angels -- and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen is still falling. (radio silence) Any messages? \nA moment's silence -- then -- \nMAGGIE (O.S.) (over radio) Gabe? \nGABE (keying it) Maggie -- \nINSIDE COPTER - TRAVERS \nyanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on -- \nTRAVERS (into radio) You wanted to make a trade earlier, Walker -- still interested? \nGABE (O.S.) (pause) I've got the money. Fly to the lake. And if you touch her -- \nTravers cuts off the radio, smiles, and banks the helicopter down around the mountain wall. \nGABE AND HAL ON BRIDGE \nCLOSE ON GABE \neyes widening with realization. Gabe gets up from the spur and starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards from safety -- before he can get very far -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \ntops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it gets between Gabe and the trees, cutting him off -- \nWOODED AREA - HAL AND MAGGIE \nwatch, powerless -- \nHAL He's going to run Gabe down -- \nTRAVERS IN HELICOPTER \nAshen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and fury as he drives the stick forward -- \nTRAVERS POV - GABE \nis stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \nwith its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes -- \nGABE \nas he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \nmoves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to circle back around for another run -- \nGABE \ngets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him -- \nIN A WOODED AREA \nHal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for all he's worth out into the clearing -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \nhas circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over, but to run him off the edge as well -- \nGABE \nlumbers as fast as he can towards the edge -- \nTRAVERS \nknows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \nflies forward, skids just inches over the snow -- \nHAL \nruns out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth in the ammo clip -- as \nTHE HELICOPTER \nflies past \nIN THE CLEARING \nHal hurls the clip, with its cloth \"fuse\" burning down, into the doorless side of the copter -- \nINSIDE THE HELICOPTER \n-- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit -- Travers sees it and looks down, but -- \nTHE \"FUSE\" \nsputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth -- \nTRAVERS \nsmiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead -- \nCLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS \nas they slice through the top of the snow towards -- \nGABE \nas he runs toward the mountain's edge -- it's just a couple of feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind -- \n-- as the copter overtakes Gabe, dipping even lower into the snow, he dives off the edge -- \nFOLLOWING GABE - FALLING \nGabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second -- \nTHE HELICOPTER \nskid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the cable ladder -- \nWIDE SHOT - THE HELICOPTER \n-- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place, rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt, the copter strains against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of it. \nON THE LADDER - GABE \nhas one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as the copter thrashes the ladder up and down -- \n", "test1_input": "is fading fast. A match's last gasp is brighter. \nGABE \nexasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on. \nGABE (garbled) Much better. \nGabe inches on to the side. Looks up to see if the crack has gotten wider. It hasn't. Gabe mumbles something phonetically near \"motherfucker\" around the flashlight, aiming it up -- \nGABE'S POV - UP \nNo opening larger than a mail slot -- \nGABE \nstill cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side -- he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it -- \nThe crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall, Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down -- \nGabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. It's now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself -- \nGABE'S POV - THE PENLIGHT \nfalls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear the penlight's receding clattering against the walls -- \nGABE \nis now, literally, in a jam. There are no handholds, no ledges, and the walls are slick. All he can do is remain braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms and legs give out. \nEXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - NEAR BLUFF'S BASE - DAY \nFrank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in the back, and Maggie is in the passenger seat. \nMAGGIE (motioning down) Bring it down here. \nFRANK Maggie -- \nMAGGIE Just do it, Frank. \nEXT. BLUFF BASE \nThe copter touches down -- Frank doesn't turn it off. Maggie jumps out with a walkie talkie. Frank makes another try. \nFRANK Maggie, this is dumb -- \nMAGGIE No it isn't. I'm going to find Brett -- I don't want to have to talk to his widow too. Fly Evan's body back to base -- I'll call you when I've found Brett. Or Hal. Or Gabe. Or anybody. \nMaggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off. Maggie moves quickly through the snow, and it isn't long before she spots multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward, and up, the buttress. Now she's really confused. But with nothing left to do, she starts climbing up the side. \nEXT. WIRE CROSSING - HAL'S POV \nAs we've caught Hal in mid-crossing, he's looking from whence he came -- the opposite side of the buttress, where Travers has a gun trained on him -- \nHAL \nunhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly provided by Travers -- \nHAL'S POV - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE \nKristel is waiting, also with a gun trained on him. Hal arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back. \nBUTTRESS SIDE OF WIRE \nKynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen, who's standing next to Travers. \nKYNETTE (motioning up) I'm going back. \nTRAVERS Look -- this part is nothing, believe me -- \nKYNETTE Walker should be coming up by now. \nKynette, automatic strapped to his chest, rushes back to the buttress' summit. \nINT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe is just as we left him. Face down, arms and legs pressing against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls. \nCarefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look -- \nGABE'S POV - UPWARD \nJust as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above him. More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to allow him to walk up. If only he can get up there. \nGABE \nsnaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself. \nGabe steadily \"walks\" up the vertical passage by bracing himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other leg and arm up. \nGabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. But there are no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply swing over and climb up. \nGABE (winded) So much for the easy part. \nOVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK \nGabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no support at all, and he springs from that all into \nTHE DIAGONAL PASSAGE \nGabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and his hands. Safe at last. Gabe carefully stands in a crouch -- and starts heading up. \nEXT. BUTTRESS TOP \nKynette moves to the edge, lies flat, and looks down -- \nKYNETTE'S POV - ON THE BUTTRESS SIDE \n", "test1_true": "KYNETTE \nsmiles and hits his headset radio. \nKYNETTE He's on the way up. I could hear that jacket before I could see it. \nTRAVERS (O.S.) (over radio) Then get the money, kill him and get back here. Now. \nKYNETTE (into radio) I'll wait till he comes to me. \nKynette flattens out to wait -- Maggie is coming up fast. \nINT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is starting to go directly upward. Gabe looks up -- \nGABE'S POV - TOP OF THE CRACK \nIt's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly make out light shining through up there. \nGABE \nknows the top is twenty feet away. Gabe starts up the easy segment, his back braced against one wall. \nEXT. TOP OF BUTTRESS - KYNETTE \nis staring down intently at the climber below -- \nKYNETTE'S POV - MAGGIE \nis now almost to the top -- sweating with exertion, she throws her hood back. \nKYNETTE \nkeys his headset radio again. \nKYNETTE (into radio) Bulletin. The climber isn't Walker -- it's a woman. \nINT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY \nGabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and distant, of Kynette talking. Gabe strains to hear -- a bad time to come up? Might be. \nEXT. BUTTRESS SIDE \nMaggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a moment, her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very surprised to see Kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun aimed down at her. \nKYNETTE Rotten weather for a climb, huh? (aims barrel) I have two questions I'd like to trouble you with. Ready? \nMaggie stares up, frozen -- whatever she was expecting, it wasn't this. \nKYNETTE This first one's easy. Do you know a man named Gabe Walker? \nMAGGIE Yes. (breathless, scared) Where is he? \nKYNETTE You don't know either? I am sorry. That was question number two. (lowers barrel) Thanks for your time. \nAs Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger -- \nGABE \nappears -- he completes his run toward Kynette's back and kicks him over the edge -- \nKYNETTE \ngoes flying over Maggie, his shots going wild -- but he catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe halt after skidding down ten feet -- \nGABE \nyanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top. Maggie gets a good look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed, he's covered with cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack. He looks like he's just spent a week in Hell. Gabe doesn't react to her reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs. \nQUALEN \nchooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he fires and automatic BURST at Gabe and Maggie. \nGABE Come on -- \nMAGGIE Where? -- \nGABE Here. \nGabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it in -- Gabe falls two feet into \nTHE CRACK - MAGGIE'S POV \nGabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a piton on the edge of the rock. He's also glowering up at Maggie a little impatiently. \nGABE Today, goddamit! \nGabe rappels down the rope into the darkness. \nMAGGIE \nhesitates -- she's still getting used to the idea of being shot at -- \nKYNETTE \nwoozy but recovered, has climbed up -- he runs toward the opening, FIRING his gun -- \nMAGGIE \ndrops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels downward. \nMaggie reaches rope's end thirty feet down, as the vertical passage again becomes diagonal. Gabe is there waiting. \nKYNETTE \nreaches the edge of the crack and FIRES down into it -- \n", "test2_input": "GABE (misses the point) Yeah, they made it pretty good then. Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping. \nGabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of what she and Gabe weigh together. \nMAGGIE (dazed) Ought to. About. (beat) Will it hold? \nGabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. Ninety feet of what looks like twine. \nGABE Depends on how big a breakfast you had. You want to go first? \nMaggie's stunned -- but there's no choice. She starts the rappel down, and Gabe is close behind. \nINSERT - THE THIRD BOMB \nis ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 -- \nMAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN \nTo make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more pressure on \nTHE ROPE \nwhich looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone -- \nMAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING \nThey swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four thousand to the ground -- \nINSERT - THE BOMB \nMAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING \nThey reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave and fifteen feet away laterally. \nGABE (shouting) Swing towards it -- and drop! \nMaggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over the cave's lip -- \nTHE ROPE \nsnaps -- \nMAGGIE AND GABE \nfall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as -- \nABOVE ON THE WALL \nThe bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant, massive rockslide -- \nMAGGIE AND GABE \ndive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past -- exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor. \nTHE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER \nFrank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion. \nFRANK What the fuck -- \nBut he sees Kristel in a clearing. Face down in the snow. First things first. \nEXT. TOWER/CLEARING \nFrank lands near her, and rushes over to her. Frank turns her over and breaks a capsule under her nose. She \"wakes up\" with a start and looks \"terrified\". \nKRISTEL What -- who are -- \nFRANK Don't worry. I'm here to help. \nKRISTEL (recovered) Glad to hear it. \nKristel sees the snap is off Frank's holster -- she grabs it, spins it around, and pulls the trigger. CLICK. Frank grabs her wrist with a move faster than you'd expect from him, and he yanks the pistol back. \nFRANK Jailhouse load. First chamber's empty -- (aims gun) -- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but things have been a little strange this morning. \nNearby, the helicopter radio crackles to life. Frank backs toward the helicopter, keeping the gun trained on Kristel. \nBut Frank only gets to the helicopter door before -- \nDELMER \ncomes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into Frank. Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he can even get a shot off. Travers runs over to Delmer and shoves the barrel up. \nTRAVER Stop! (explaining) You'll damage the helicopter. \nAs if to punctuate this, Frank -- and the now ruined pilot side door -- fall to the ground. The radio continues to squawk as Travers grabs Frank's discarded gun. \nTRAVERS (to Kristel) Answer that. \nKristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio. \nSTUART (O.S.) (over radio) Calling Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over -- \nKRISTEL (keying radio) Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over -- \nEXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY \nWright, davis, and an irritated Stuart huddle over a radio. \nSTUART This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation Administration -- please identify -- over -- \nEXT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nBy now, the others have come out of hiding and up to the helicopter.

Over -- \n", "test2_true": "KRISTEL (keying mike) Copy, FAA. Distress call came at approximately eleven hundred hours yesterday. I investigated -- the call turned out to be a false alarm. Over. \nEXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY \nStuart gestures with exasperated triumph. \nSTUART Please repeat, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- distress call was a false alarm? -- over -- \nKRISTEL (O.S.) (over radio) Repeat, distress call was a definite false alarm -- we've had several here. Somebody's sick idea of a joke. Do you require further assistance -- over -- \nSTUART Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over and out -- \nStuart shuts off the radio with finality. \nSTUART I don't want to say I told you so. But I did. Can I go back to work now? \nEXT. HELICOPTER/TOWER CLEARING - DAY \nKristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket. \nTRAVERS I almost believed you myself. \nTravers smiles and turns, looking at \nHAL \ntrembling with fury and grief, bent over Frank's body as the last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips. He's gone. Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend. \nHAL (quiet) Goodbye, Frank. \nTravers moves up behind Hal and kicks him. \nTRAVERS Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere. \nHAL (low) Fuck off. \nTravers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow. \nHAL I think I'll wait here. You just murdered three of my friends. Sooner or later, whoever's chasing you is going to show up and return the favor, and I'd love to watch. \nTravers puts his gun at Hal's forehead and shrugs. \nTRAVERS Suit yourself. You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members I know has zero imagination -- and I can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week. (beat) No, you're taking us where we want to go. Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch. You want to kill me -- more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance. (tightens trigger) Am I right? \nHal's answer is a stony, loathing stare. He gets up. But -- \nINSERT - HAL'S HAND \n-- we can see Hal has palmed something from Frank's body. \nINT. CAVE - GABE AND MAGGIE \nDust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but the worst is over. Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully. \nGABE Are you okay? \nMAGGIE My ears are ringing -- but I'm all right. Gabe, what's going on? \nGABE (shows money in his pack) This. That plane crash -- it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range. They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and right now they're heading for the rest of it. \nMAGGIE Where? \nGABE It's close to the lake -- Hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it. (stiffly gets up) I can get there first -- all I have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder -- \nMAGGIE \"All?\" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you expect to do then? \nGABE (aching) Something -- subtle. \nGabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like Quasimodo than a champion climber. Maggie stops him. \nMAGGIE I'm going with you. \nGABE No way. You're climbing back down -- try to get to the station or find some help. \nMAGGIE I'm just as good a climber as you are -- and right now, I'm definitely in better shape. \nGABE (hard) And you're definitely not going -- \nMaggie stares Gabe down. Guess who won all the arguments when they were together. Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar exasperation. \nGABE Okay. Come on -- \nAs they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot. \nGABE -- but the second you slow me down, I'm leaving -- (slips on sore leg, Maggie catches him) -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood? \nMAGGIE (helping Gabe out) Anything you say, Gabe. \nEXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - ON CHUNK OF WRECKAGE \nIf you have a good imagination, this corner of charcoal looks like it could have been -- \nWRIGHT (O.S.) One of the currency cases. \nWRIGHT AND DAVIS \nare standing over some of the wreckage. One of the suits bags and tags the \"briefcase\". \nDAVIS We've tested the ash inside -- it's the right paper. \nWRIGHT What about the men? \nDAVIS It's -- hard to tell. But forensics says yes. All of them were in the plane. \nWRIGHT (sags with the news) Everything's accounted for, then -- time to head back and start making excuses. (beat) Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I just don't give a shit. It's one more run of the press. But we lost five good men and they aren't so easily replaced. (beat) Especially a guy like Travers. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TOP/TOWER - HELICOPTER - DAY \n", "test3_input": "Dedicated agent Travers leans in reasonable comfort against the helicopter and keys his headset mike. \nTRAVERS Qualen. How far along are you? \nQUALEN (O.S.) (over radio) Not as far as we'd be with the helicopter. \nFURTHER DOWN ON MOUNTAIN/TOWER \nQualen, Kristel and Delmer follow Hal's lead down the side -- it's not too steep a grade, but it's solid rock and it's covered with ice and fresh snow -- all have to brace themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down. \nTRAVERS (O.S.) (over radio) We have less than half a tank of fuel, Eric -- if we burn it up treasure hunting we'll never get off this rock. Now -- how far away are you? \nQUALEN (keys radio) It looks like two miles, but -- \nQualen's foot slides out from under him -- he catches himself. \nQUALEN -- it'll take some time. \nTRAVERS (O.S.) (over radio) Time we have -- Walker's dead, Wright's an idiot. And our guide -- \nQUALEN (keys radio) What about him? \nTRAVERS (O.S.) (over radio) As soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity -- kill him. \nQUALEN (keys radio) Agreed. \nHAL \ncan only hear Qualen's end of the conversation -- but his face shows he can guess what they're talking about. \nCUT TO: \nGABE'S FACE - CLOSE \nGabe's rattled too -- but for a brand new reason -- we PULL BACK to see Gabe at \nTHE WIRE'S EDGE \nwhere the wire -- that wire -- links the buttress with the facing Tower. Whipping in the wind, it looks risky -- but that's not the problem. \nGabe stares at the other edge for a moment. Immobile. Remembering Susan's death. Gabe shakes out of it when -- \nMAGGIE Gabe? (beat) I'll go first. \nGABE (shakes his head) If I don't go first, I might not go at all. \nGabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging himself, hand over hand, across the abyss -- no safety line this time. As his weight pulls the line taut, the wind rocks him back and forth. Gabe steadily drags himself out -- \nGABE ON WIRE - LONG SHOT \nFatigue stops Gabe in the middle -- a half mile up, strung between two gigantic mountains, he looks as insignificant and alone as a man possibly can be -- \nCLOSER ON GABE \nPanting with exertion, frozen -- he can barely hold his grip and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support. Gabe's eyes are shut -- he looks near collapse -- \nFLASHBACK - GABE'S POV \nGabe is falling from the wire in slow motion, trailing Susan -- she spirals out of reach as his line SNAPS him back -- \nGABE'S \ngrip unconsciously relaxes -- but his eyes jolt open and he clamps both hands shut on the wire. Gabe, drawing on some inner fury, drags himself with long, sharp yanks -- \nMAGGIE \ntensely watches Gabe's crossing -- \nOVERVIEW - GABE \nis about ten feet away from the end -- \nGABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE END OF THE WIRE \nlooks a lot further away than that -- \nGABE \npulls faster -- and reaches the other side. Gabe maintains his hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge, leaning back against the wall to catch his breath. \nGABE (winded, shouting across) Think you can beat my time? \nMAGGIE \nsmiles -- this is more like the Gabe she remembers. She gets on the wire and starts across in a fast, easy rhythm. \nGABE \nwatches her, grinning. Admiration for Maggie is washing away bad memories of Susan. \nGABE (to himself) Shit -- she is in better shape. \nMaggie pulls across fearlessly -- but -- \nINSERT - THE BOLT \non Gabe's side of the wire is giving where Travers had hacked at it -- just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose -- \nGABE \ndoesn't notice and shouts across at Maggie, now half way. \nGABE (enjoying it now) Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got all day -- \nINSERT - THE BOLT \nis coming looser -- Maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring -- \n", "test3_true": "who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five -- \nINSERT - THE BOLT \npops out of the wall as if it were shot -- \nTHE WIRE \nwhich was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm -- Maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short of the ledge -- \nGABE \ndrops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out towards hers in one lightning-fast motion -- \nTHEIR HANDS \ncatch -- \nGABE \nmaintains his grip on Maggie's hand, but her weight nearly pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down, the window goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's bottom, but their grip holds. \nAll of this in a split second. Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm, locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear. She finds a handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with Gabe's help. Maggie collapses into Gabe's arms and they fall back against the wall, but Gabe's the one who's really holding on tight. \nGABE That -- tears it. (gasping) You're not coming any further. \nMAGGIE (just as breathless) Gabe -- you're going to get yourself killed -- \nGABE (breath almost back) Maybe. But I'm not getting you killed. (she starts a reply) Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll happen when I catch up with Hal -- but I've got to know one thing for sure -- that you're making it off this mountain. Alive. \nGabe's eyes are pleading. Maggie hesitates. But gives in. \nMAGGIE Okay. \nGabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesn't want to turn this into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might be. They stand -- and separate. Gabe moves away. \nGABE Get on the trail and stay out of sight. (beat) I'll see you on the ground. \nMaggie wonders if she will as Gabe vanishes around a corner. \nEXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - CLOSE ON BODY BAG \nas the zipper is pulled down -- before we can see anything we mercifully reverse POV to \nWRIGHT, DAVIS AND STUART \nnear a helicopter, look down with disgust. Davis turns away. \nWRIGHT I give up. What was it? \nA SEARCH PILOT zips the bag back up. \nSEARCH PILOT ID says this used to be your pilot. (beat) And we found him seven miles east of the wreck. \nDavis and Wright look at each other, drawing the same conclusion. \nWRIGHT A hijack. (beat) The plane was hijacked. Son of a bitch -- \nSTUART Oh, give me a break. Your pilot lost it when the flight started going south, and he bailed -- \nSEARCH PILOT Excuse me -- but there's no parachute there. Check it yourself. \nBefore this can go on, a FORENSICS AGENT runs up to Stuart carrying a recorder. \nFORENSICS AGENT Sir -- we found the flight recorder -- it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater. It was demolished, but we salvaged the recording -- \nSTUART (grabbing it away) I've heard a thousand of these, Wright -- whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the Lord's Prayer and wind up screaming \"Oh, shit\" at ground zero -- \nStuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish, but his smug look melts as the voice of FBI agent Matheson explains -- \nMATHESON (O.S.) (shouting, rushed) -- the money's been stolen -- Travers and the pilot were in on it -- the pilot's dead, but Travers took the cash and made a mid-air transfer to a jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't respond -- (screaming) shiiiiii-- \nMatheson is cut off by the sound of impact, which is followed by silence. Wright gently turns the recorder off. \nWRIGHT Guess we're both right, Stuart. Thanks for your expertise. (turns to pilot) Well? (jerking a thumb back) You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day for him to pull his head out of his ass -- let's get it in the air! \nWright, Davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter -- Stuart pauses, but goes after them. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN WALL/TOWER - HIGH ANGLE - GABE MOVING ON A LEDGE \nthat's a little narrower than your coffee table. It's got irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet -- and Gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps, leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand foot drop. \nGabe's gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity, and with renewed purpose. Gabe makes the last jump to a section of ledge near the bottom of \nTHE \"BITKER\" LADDER \nwhich consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top -- something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's toy. And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabe's outstretched arms. \nGABE Hasn't gotten any lower in the last year. (coiling for jump) Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would another four feet have killed you? \nGabe leaps up, grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile of air, and he shoots up the ladder as we PULL BACK -- \nWIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN WALL \nA closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak. \nAs we track Gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain. Its constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks through circular currents on the surface. \nELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL AND GANG \nare negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the fresh, thick snow -- we can see from their relative position to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them. A very slight one. \nTOP OF LADDER - GABE \npulls himself over and starts running -- as he does, he uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the \"BITKER CLIMB\" and takes it with him, moving ahead into a \nWOODED AREA \n"}

COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nThe Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming finally to a cabin settled in a clearing. \nGABE \npulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park. He doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's going in or not. Finally -- he cuts the ignition. \nINT. CABIN - DAY \nA knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside. \nGABE Maggie? \nNo answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.  Gabe smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at the back of the cabin shakes him out of it. \nEXT. CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR \nhas come open and swings in the wind. Gabe steps outside and pulls it shut. Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a small but sturdy shed a few yards away. Gabe heads over to it. \nINT. SHED - DAY \nNot a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off. \nA LARGE PLASTIC CAGE \n-- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing. \nMAGGIE Hey there -- \nThe door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just looks awkward. \nGABE Hi. (beat) Could you introduce us? \nMAGGIE Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27. A27 -- Gabe. \nGABE Not the tag -- what do you call him? \nMAGGIE Her. I call her Lucky. \nGABE (bends down, eyes wound) Poachers? (Maggie nods) Bastards... \nMAGGIE They got the mother -- and left this one behind. Too small to make a decent trophy, I guess. \nGABE About four months, right? (Maggie nods) Christ -- it must have been just about his -- I mean her -- first flight -- \nMAGGIE Time to change the dressing. \n", "test2_true": "GABE You can't do that alone -- \nMAGGIE I've had to learn. She trust me -- \nMaggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing. \nGABE I'm making her nervous -- (beat) You hold her, I'll do the dressing. \nGabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the wound. \nGABE Got some fight in her -- that's good. (beat) What happened to Dave? \nMAGGIE The usual. Flew off -- never calls, never writes -- \nGabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him hand away. \nMAGGIE I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind of wish you hadn't come. I was almost used to you being gone. (beat, quiet) Why are you here? \nGABE (pauses) I thought I came back to see if I'd learned to live with it. Well, big surprise. Coming back just tore me open all over again, like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago. Nothing's changed. Including the way I feel about you. (beat) I didn't realize it till I saw you at the airport. But I came back for you, Maggie. \nMAGGIE Does that mean you're going to stay? \nGABE No. Not here. (beat) I want you come with me. Start over, somewhere else. \nMAGGIE (incredulous) You come back after being gone a year, and you expect me to -- (beat) You don't live here any more, Gabe. Your choice, remember? But this is my home. I'm not leaving. You can stay with me, or you can go alone. It's still your choice. \nHAL (O.S.) Now there's an easy call. \nStanding in the shed's doorway is Hal. Stone faced. Grim. \nOUTSIDE SHED \nFurious, Gabe heads out after Hal. \nGABE What the hell do you want? \nHAL (beat) I need your help. A plane's gone down on Comb Bluff. This storm would blow a copter all over the place -- but we can climb up to it. \nGABE \"We\"? (beat) Talk to somebody who's still on the payroll. You've got a half dozen new guys -- \nHAL -- who couldn't climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it. But you've soloed it. \nGABE During the summer. On a bet. \nHAL This is a little more important than a bet. Just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter, camping in a zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning. \nGABE (shakes his head) Maybe you missed the headlines -- but I don't do rescues any more. They're bad for my conscience. (beat) Fuck this one up on your own. \nGabe walks past Hal. Furious, Hal spins Gabe around. \nHAL Play it again, Gabe, about how we killed her. I was there too, remember? \nGABE (hot) Not like I was, pal -- her fingers brushed mine on the way down -- \nHAL (right back) -- and I was the one who had to deal with her family when you fucking tore out of town. (takes a breath) We lost her. Whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip, you and I have to live with that. But right now, there are some more people who need our help, and they shouldn't die too just because you've got a problem keeping the past in the past. \nGabe knows he's right. But he's hesitant. And scared. \nGABE I don't want the responsibility. \nHAL Walk away and you are responsible. They'll die. I can't do this alone. (Gabe slows but doesn't stop) You know what else, Gabe? You can go anywhere you want, but if you don't do this, now, you're going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life. \nGabe turns. Sees Maggie in the doorway. She's heard every word. Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods. \nEXT. COMB BLUFF TRAILHEAD - WIDE SHOT - DAY \nRelative to the other mountains, Comb Bluff is smaller -- about 2,500 feet high. But that's like saying the Empire State Building is smaller than the Sears Tower. It's still a long way up if you're climbing the stairs. \nON THE GROUND - GABE AND HAL \nwith full packs of mountaineering gear on. They've got to climb up this beast. Gabe -- now back in his orange Sheriff's jacket -- scrambles with Hal up the base of the mountain, the last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall. Gabe takes a bolt gun -- which fires rope-fastened bolts into rock -- and hangs it from a strap on his chest. \nHAL (indicating gun) That thing's dead weight. Completely useless for an ice climb. \nGABE Just backup. \nGabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall. \nGABE (not a challenge) I'll lead. I left a few bolts last time I climbed this -- I think I can find some of them. \nHal starts up after Gabe, easily keeping pace with him. \nHAL Save the rope for when it gets tough. (beat, realizing) That bet was for you to free climb the wall. \nGABE (further up) Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you the twenty bucks back, okay? \nCOMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT \nTwo orange specks move their way up the mountain -- it's definitely going to be a long trip. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT - DAY - GABE AND HAL \nare now visibly two-thirds of the way up. \nCLOSER ON GABE AND HAL - THE MOUNTAIN FACE \nis not only higher, it's a lot tougher to climb. Instead of being angular, the wall is now completely vertical -- and coated with ice. Rough, irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and Hal can grip -- it's a matter of grabbing what you can for a handhold, and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on their boots into the ice for footholds. Gabe leads, planting pitons into the ice, threading the rope through them as he goes. Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal. Their only safety net. Gabe, trailing rope behind him, goes up a difficult slab of ice and climbs under a ledge, where he anchors the rope in the ice with another piton. \nGABE (shouting down) Anchored! \nHAL \nis beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the fifty foot rope. Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb, he pulls out the piton, then moves on to the second -- but up above \nHIGHER ON THE MOUNTAIN \n", "test2_id": 2005, "test3_input": "FIRES until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the tree line as his target comes out, skidding to a stop in the snow.

MOUNTAIN - SLOPING GRADE - GABE AND KRISTEL \nGabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain edge, ahead of Kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back. \nKRISTEL How much further? \nGABE (stops) It's right over there. \nGabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a \nA SHED \nthat is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant across a snowy plateau. \nGABE AND KRISTEL \nGABE It's a storage locker for the rangers. Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there -- skiis, food -- I'll show you -- \nGabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this -- \nKRISTEL Don't move. \nKristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun trained on him as she crunches through the snow. \nKRISTEL Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too, right? (moves backward) Keep walking. Not too close. \nGABE We'd make better time walking straight ahead. Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer. \nKRISTEL (walking backward) Right. So I'd better have one less problem when he arrives. \nGABE (knowing this means him) Don't fuck up. You still need me to show you a route off the mountain. \nKRISTEL You've worn that one out, Walker -- (snaps back bolt) -- I'll find my own way down. \nKristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe, but her feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- -- Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it collapses under her -- she's pulling the trigger and SHOTS go wild as she sinks and sinks -- \nON GABE \nwho's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land, Kristel's SHOTS arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles around him -- but he bellies ahead as -- \nON THE SNOWDRIFT'S TOP \nKristel's GUNSHOTS slow, and finally, stop, the very last of them loosening the snow around -- \nTHE \"SHED\" \nthat was obscured by snow was a tall, three-sided park service sign shouting \"WARNING -- SNOWDRIFT -- DO NOT CROSS\" in eight different languages. The rest of the snow falls away from it, revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow. \nGABE \nbellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the ice axe's staff -- only when he hits something solid with it does he get back up to his feet. But the sound of ice-crusted snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that -- \nQUALEN \nhas just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's gun BLAZES down -- \nGABE \nis on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into \nA THICK WOODED AREA \nwhich is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in seconds. Gabe looks down the slope. Running is impractical. So he sits down. \nQUALEN \narrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope -- \nQUALEN'S POV - GABE \nis whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder. Alpinists call this a \"sitting glissade\". Colorado climbers call it \"butt skiing\". Some psychos do this for fun. \nGABE'S POV - THE SLIDE \nis anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and out of trees and boulders in his path -- \nQUALEN \nstarts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at -- \nGABE \nwho tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down -- \n-- to the slope's bottom.

MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL \nrushes down to Delmer's body -- in the snow, he finds the discarded machine gun and holds it up, but stray bullets from Travers' fusillade have made it inoperable. Hal tosses it aside and checks Delmer's bloody pockets for more weapons. Nothing. Just a couple of machine gun clips, and the bolt gun. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MAGGIE \nis wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of the mountain. In plain view, \nTRAVERS IN HELICOPTER \nis circling the mountain -- he spots Maggie from on high and moves down after her. \nMAGGIE \nhears the helicopter, and turns around -- she has no way of knowing it isn't Frank, so she takes off her jacket and waves it as a signal -- \nMAGGIE Frank! Down here! \nThe helicopter moves down until Maggie can see -- \nTRAVERS \nis at the controls. \nMAGGIE \nstarts running, but it's useless. Nowhere to hide. Travers hovers over her, FIRING ahead of her, FIRING behind her, not to kill, just to make a point. He's in charge. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL \nMaggie finally stops -- Travers lands the copter and opens the passenger door, keeping his gun trained on her. \nTRAVERS Hop in. I know someone who'd like to see you again before he dies. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE - QUALEN \nmoves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood in the snow. Gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a bonus. \nQualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick, flat ice chunks circling in the currents. But Gabe's footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge. \nQualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down -- \nQUALEN'S POV - THE BRIDGE'S PLANKS \nThe blood -- and slush from Gabe's boots -- end halfway across. \nQUALEN \nSmiles and shakes his head. Too obvious. Gabe is hiding underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel supports. Qualen slows his pace, staring down through the thin, but visible cracks between the planks. \nTIGHT CLOSE-UP - GABE'S FACE \ngrimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion -- lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge. \nQUALEN (O.S.) You've come a long way to die. \nQUALEN \nenjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun. \nQUALEN If you were smart, you'd have left your friend behind. I would have. There's no shame in staying alive. \nQualen stops, staring down. Through the gaps, Gabe's parka is visible. Right where the blood trail ends. \nQUALEN (aims down) But you're not smart. And now you're going to die from an overdose of heroism. \nQualen BLAZES the gun into the planks -- \nUNDER THE BRIDGE - GABE \nis clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge, several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being shredded by the FUSILLADE -- without the parka, Gabe is freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for comfort as they RICOCHET on the bridge's supports -- \nQUALEN \nstops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down -- \n-- and sees there's nothing in the parka except for Gabe's back. Qualen's face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react, Gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the shoulder strap of Qualen's machine gun -- Gabe yanks down, and Qualen falls head first \nUNDER THE BRIDGE \nwith Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a leg on one of the steel supports -- but both \nTHE ICE AXE AND THE GUN \nfall, landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath the bridge -- \nIN THE SUPPORTS \nGabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches him with his good arm, but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- -- Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his shoulder wound -- Gabe YELLS in pain and tries to block the next one, but Qualen punches him again, and Gabe lets go of the support, falling -- -- on the way down, Gabe grabs Qualen's leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge, Gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualen's leg, and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg -- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go -- both \nQUALEN AND GABE \nfall -- they land hard, not in the water, but on a raft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the current. Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up -- they're in danger not just from each other, but from \nTHE FAST APPROACHING WHIRLPOOL \nwhere the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling vortex that drains into the waterfall -- \nON THE ICE RAFT \nQualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong move, they'll both go over.

They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer. 
SEAN (CONT'D) I can't stop drinkin. 
BILLY laughs. 
BILLY Why would you even think of stopping drinking? 
SEAN He don't like it. He don't like drinkin...he don't like fightin... (Sean looks sad) ...he says stay out of the bars... You know, we're not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin' Worcester. 
BILLY Who says? 
SEAN He says. Costello says. God says, as far as you're concerned. 
INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT 
Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer. 
SEAN Not a cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks like his shit don't stink but he's good people. 
VILLAIN Cunt cop. 
MISTER FRENCH I knew his father. I liked his uncle Jackie better. 
SEAN Uncle Jackie was excellent. 
AN IRISH VILLAIN Fucking guineas. 
They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering at the bar. 
BILLY A cranberry juice. 
WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR It's a natural diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she got her period. (to BILLY) You got your period? 
BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH. Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the hook. 
BILLY Get your hands off me. 
MISTER FRENCH Do you know me? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY No. 
BILLY shakes his head no. 
MISTER FRENCH I'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you don't. That's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit, so I'm fucking ruling on it right now that you don't hit him, understand? 
BILLY Yeah. Excellent. Fine. 
MISTER FRENCH I know you. I know your family. Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet cousin I'll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that? 
BILLY Yeah. 
MISTER FRENCH Now you know me. 
BILLY Yeah. 
A beat: they stare at each other. 
MISTER FRENCH What are you drinking? 
BILLY Cranberry juice. 
A beat. 
MISTER FRENCH What is it, your period? 
BILLY laughs. 
MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D) Get him a cranberry juice. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG is bleeding, incredulous. MISTER FRENCH takes him by the shoulder. 
MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D) (sotto voce to WELL- DRESSED SCUMBAG) That's Jackie's nephew. 
WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG Oh... 
MISTER FRENCH Oh, what? 
FRENCH demolishes him with body blows. 
FRENCH Get the fuck out of here. 
EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY 
COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes) stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking whiskey at 9 in the morning. 
COLIN Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him? 
MRS KENNEFICK Allegedly. 
COLIN (grimaces) "Allegedly". 
MRS KENNEFICK If he was killed he probably did something wrong. 
COLIN You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That's not what you think he did wrong. 
MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by. 
INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. DAY. 
Costello and Gwen are in the car.    Gwen is dressed like Jackie O. 
COSTELLO Wave to your girlfriend.

{"train": "FEAST \nWritten by \nPatrick Melton & Marcus Dunston \nRevised Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill. \nFar in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES perched on a barren tree watch the intruders. \nEXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut and naive). \nChief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth before them. \nCHIEF This is it. \nLANKY Why did it have to be these caves... \nCOLLEGE BOY Is something wrong? \nLANKY (to College Boy) Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'. \nChief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck. \nThe logo on the rear gate reads \"WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT.\" \nCHIEF Let's get that first barrel. \nThe gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol. \nINT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER \nCollege Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men. \nCOLLEGE BOY What's with the awkward silence? \nLANKY You don't know? \nCollege Boy shakes his head \"no\" and they set the cart down. \nCHIEF Last winter, a man kidnapped a little girl and holed up in one of these caves. The cops had him pinned down and began to move in. This guy started shooting... but he wasn't aiming at the officers... (getting closer) ...he was firing at something inside. \nCollege Boy is rapt. \nCHIEF When the dust cleared, all they found was the little girl's shoes. (beat) With the feet still in 'em. \nSomething GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump. \nCOLLEGE BOY Ahh!!! \nLanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed. \nCOLLEGE BOY Assholes. \nCHIEF Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself when my boss pulled that one on me. \nLANKY I went well beyond nearly. \nThen, a sound. All eyes turn. \nCHIEF What was that? \nCOLLEGE BOY Once was plenty, fellas. \nCHIEF Shhhh... \nAs Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe. \nInstantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams. \nMEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around her neck. She charges towards Chief. \nMEAN GREEN Stop it right there! You will not rape Mother Nature one more day! \nThe title SHATTERS... \nINT. CRASHED CAR -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - We frantically EMERGE from the burning wreck... RUN from the crash over desolate prairie land... \nEXT. BAR -- NIGHT \nNeon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles. \nA 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads \"MY OTHER TOY HAS TITS.\" \nA weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him. \nNAME: BOZO AGE: 32 JOB: UNEMPLOYED OCCUPATION: TOWN JACKASS LIFE EXPECTANCY: DEAD BY DAWN \nThe rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes through the front entrance -- \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nBozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin. \nTalking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone. \nCOACH (into pay phone) They took my laptop with my PowerPoint presentation, my Blackberry, my cell... And to top it off, my car crapped out on the side of the road! I'm not making the conference and I have fourteen leads waiting for me. You gotta help me out here. I'm not kidding, I've have fourteen PRIMO leads waiting in the lobby of the Mariott... MARIOTT... \nFreeze on him. \nNAME: COACH AGE: 42 OCCUPATION: LIFE COACH & MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER FUN FACT: OFTEN CALLED THE GREEK TONY ROBBINS LIFE EXPECTANCY: STAY FAR, FAR AWAY \nCLICK. The pay phone goes dead. \nCOACH Son of a -- (deep breath, soothing) In with anger, out with love. \nFurther into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo. \nFreeze on him. \nNAME: PARA AGE: 29 OCCUPATION: FIREWORKS DEALER COMIC BOOK COLLECTION: RIDICULOUSLY HUGE LIFE EXPECTANCY: THEY WOULDN'T KILL A CRIPPLE... WOULD THEY? \nBozo's tank-top reads, \"ONLY COOL CHICKS CAN DO ME.\" \nPARA (rolling away) Hey... \nBOZO Shut up, fag. \nBozo punches in his selection. EDGY CAT (34, samurai pony tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue. \nEDGY CAT (to Bozo) You're late! \nBOZO Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em! \nThe CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN. \nBozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away. \nNOTE: Music plays over all the bar sequences. \nEXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nBeer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer behind the bar. Freeze on him. \nNAME: BEER GUY AGE: 32 OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S BOTH \nHe talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big earring) who preps a drink. \nBEER GUY I mean, we'd been together for so long and then... bang! She drops me. Since then, it's been like a damn country song: she's gone, the car's repossessed, and a father figure made a pass at me. I'm not saying I ever had it. But I have definitely lost it. (beat) Now I haul this swill from armpit to armpit. I used to be a model for Christ's sake. \nCoach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches. \nCOACH For what, may I ask? \nBEER GUY JC Penny. Spring wear. \nBeer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder and delivering his \"model\" cheese smile. \nCOACH You know, Chach, catching you at this low point is pure serendipity. \nTrampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver. \nAdulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy. \nADULTERER Just bring the whole bottle. \nEXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nTuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise. \nFreeze on her. \nNAME: BELLE AGE: 21 OCCUPATION: WAITRESS GOAL: PLAY BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\" LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\" \nBELLE If I could made that kind of money, I'd be in Hollywood next week. \nBoss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her teeth and moves to the staircase. \nTUFFY 'Round here, there are ways. \nBoss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze. \nFreeze on him. \nNAME: BOSS MAN AGE: 47 OCCUPATION: BAR OWNER MOTTO: IF THERE'S GRASS IN THE FIELD, PLAY BALL LIFE EXPECTANCY: REGULAR OR EXTRA-CRISPY? \nEXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar... \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nBozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game. \nEDGY CAT That cash is gonna look much better in my pocket. \nBOZO (re: mounted head) Ya know, that deer only looks scared when you're in the room. \nPara rolls up behind Edgy. \nPARA Excuse me, please. \nEDGY CAT Jesus! \nEdgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline. \nEXT. BAR -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nPara's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot. \nEDGY CAT That's all she wrote... \nSMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball ricochets away as intended. \nPara flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch. \nEDGY CAT What?! \nBOZO Ohhh, now that's a rough one. \nEDGY CAT That's motherfuckin' impossible! \nBOZO (crude Oriental accent) Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go again? \nEDGY CAT Goddamn it! NO! \nBOZO Oh, come on. Crape Diem! \nBozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away cursing to himself and moves to the bar. \nRoadie looks on, sipping a beer. \nFreeze on Roadie. \nBOZO I got two hundred bucks says none of you can beat me! \nBARTENDER Hey! Get quiet or get out. \nBOZO C'mon guys -- \nEXT. BAR -- NIGHT \nP.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and -- \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nBOZO Gimme some ACTION -- \nBOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass). \nKRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks -- \nMUSIC CUTS OUT \nHero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK. \nHe SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the handles, securing them. \nHERO Unless you people want to die you'll do what I say and you'll do it fast! \nBartender cocks his SHOTGUN. \nBARTENDER You hold it right there, mister. \nHERO A storm of hell's coming down on this place any minute! \nBARTENDER Drop the canon! \nHero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender. \nHERO I'm not armed now, just hear me out. \nBARTENDER I'll drop you and not even think about it! \nHERO Let me explain! \nBARTENDER You got one second to -- \nHero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see. \nHERO Take a good look and listen to me! There's at least a four of these things out there! \nGrandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal head with spiked hair. \nHERO I saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob! (off silence, shock) I don't know what they are. I don't know where they came from. All I do know is that these fuckers are fast, nasty, and hungry. \nThe bar stares at him, slack-jawed. \nHERO And they can fly. Not to mention they got claws like Ginsu knifes and more teeth than a chainsaw. \nThe Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, \"THE JUDGE.\" \nHERO They're like goddamn blood hungry biker tattoos come to life. They're clocking us. Right now. And we have to lock this bar down! (moving around) That means doors, windows, drains, and basements. We have to do it fast! \nHero looks out the lone front window. \nHERO (looks to Belle) You! Get on that phone. Call the cops, National Guard, townies, whoever kicks ass and get 'em out here. \nBelle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar. \nHERO Any questions? \nBARTENDER Who are you? \nHERO I'm the hero -- \nCRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling -- \nSECOND FLOOR \nThe Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS. \nMAIN BAR \nHero's right half is JERKED outside through the window. \nHEROINE The jungle has a new king. \nFreeze on her. \nNAME: HEROINE AGE: 27 OCCUPATION: SURVIVOR LIFE EXPECTANCY: HOPEFULLY LONGER THAN THE LAST HERO \nCUT TO: \nPan and scan over various NEWSPAPER HEADINGS with pictures and newsreel footage that read: \n\"EDWARDS, CALIFORNIA 1940: HIKING CLUB MAULED BY BEARS\" \n\"LOCKHART, CALIFORNIA 1948: BRUSH FIRE DEMOLISHES RURAL COMMUNITY, DOZENS MISSING\" \n\"HI-VISTA, CALIFORNIA 1956: UNIVERSITY ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG BURIED IN MINE SHAFT COLLAPSE\" \n\"PEARBLOSSOM, CALIFORNIA 1964: AVALANCHE BLAMED FOR MISSING HORSEBACK RIDERS\" \n\"SALTDALE, CALIFORNIA 1972: MUDSLIDE CLAIMS LOCAL BROWNIE TROOP EARNING COURAGE BADGES\" \n\"GARLOCK, CALIFORNIA 1980: ELDERLY TOUR GROUP WASHED AWAY BY FLASH FLOOD\" \n\"CALTIL, CALIFORNIA 1988: SINKHOLES DEMOLISH A STRING OF CABINS, SEVERAL FAMILIES PERISH\" \n\"WILSONA GARDENS, CALIFORNIA 1996: GAS LEAK EXPLOSION DESTROYS HILLSIDE COMMUNITY\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nThere is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns. \nBOSS MAN Is it clear?! \nBARTENDER Yeah. \nBOSS MAN Is there a gun pointing at you? \nBARTENDER Nah, I got the gun. \nBoss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38. \nBOSS MAN Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? Who did it!? \nBelle and Bartender move to his aid. \nBOSS MAN My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? \nBARTENDER (motioning to Heroine) Her fella. \nHEROINE My husband... \nBOSS MAN Well, where's the sonuvabitch!? \nHEROINE He's dead. \nBOSS MAN What? (noticing destruction) What the hell happened down here?! \nBoss Man looks to Bozo. \nBOZO I didn't do it! It was fuckin' monsters, asshole! \nBOSS MAN Jesus Christ on the cross... someone make sense. \nHEROINE Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. One went through three of your patrons like nothing. \nBOSS MAN So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside? \nHEROINE He only shot you once. \nBOSS MAN Huh? \nHEROINE (re: Bartender) He shot you the other time. \nBARTENDER It was an accident. Sorry. \nBoss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA BEAST'S HEAD on the bar. \nADULTERER Look at it! \nBOSS MAN Fan-fuckin-tastic. \nTUFFY Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go! \nHEROINE Let's lock off this room. \nTUFFY (moving to exit) Never, ever, never. Never, ever, never, baby. I love you -- \nSMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere. \nTUFFY NOOOOOOOO! \nPapa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window. \nBartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender. \nPapa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the wood shutters closed. \nTuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut. \nHEROINE Damn it. \nMAIN BAR \nBeer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender. \nBEER GUY Oh god... \nHe hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what happened. The horror hits home. \nHeroine eyes the destroyed phone. \nCOACH (to Tuffy) Are you -- \nHeroine puts a hand up to silence Coach. \nHEROINE Just let her be... please. (beat) Is that the only phone? \nBartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic and wires. \nBARTENDER The back phone is wrecked, too. \nTrampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse. \nBELLE This is really happening. I can't believe this is really happening. \nGrandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats. \nGRANDPA What'd you say? \nGRANDMA I didn't say anything. \nBartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa Beast head at the end of the bar. \nPara is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair. \nBelle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming from the wheelchair's back rest. \nPARA Thank you, but I don't need any help -- \nBELLE What's this? A power magnet or something? \nPARA No. It's nothing. \nBelle puts together his scam with a smirk. \nBELLE I didn't peg you for a con man. \nPARA Hey, it pays more than the couch. \nBELLE Lots of stuff around here does. \nTrampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse. \nTRAMPY Here! \nThe group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it. \nTRAMPY Hey! \nADULTERER Back off! \nBeer Guy walks from behind the bar. \nHeroine sighs a gust of relief. \nREPORTER But always remember, don't look straight into the sun because a special filter is needed to avoid damaging your cornea. \nThe Reporter beams. \nREPORTER And we're all looking forward to it tomorrow. Back to you. \nIn the studio, the Newscaster smirks. \nNEWSCASTER Thank you. And in other news... \nRoadie points to the TV. \nROADIE That studio's local, we can call in. \nBOSS MAN I have a short wave radio upstairs. \nTrampy is already dialing on the cell. \nTRAMPY I'm calling them... it's ringing! \nROADIE They'd have a police scanner. \nTRAMPY (into cell) Hello? Yes, we're at the United -- \nON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine. \nNEWSCASTER ...it has been reported that the power outage -- \nA Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast cuts out, turning to static. \nTrampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact. \nTRAMPY Oh no! Oh fucking no! \nHeroine, tense, quells the rising panic. \nHEROINE Keep it together! I came from the east. That studio is south of here. For all we know, north and west are okay. \nROADIE An associate of mine was coming in from the north, ain't heard a word from him in hours. \nHEROINE So, that leaves the west. \nTuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat. \nTUFFY And Red Mountain. Your daughter. \nHeroine looks over, making eye contact. \nHEROINE Right. \nBEER GUY This is goddamn depressing. \nAt the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun. \nBOSS MAN I've got some tools and extra planks in the kitchen, if we're on the same page here. \nHEROINE Let's work. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nThe last board is hammered into place as the survivors back away from the now re-enforced bar. \nBARTENDER We'll it ain't pretty... \nBOSS MAN But its got teeth. \nBAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler. \nBOZO I think it's hungry again. \nHEROINE We have to kill it. (to Boss Man) Can you help? \nBoss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior Beast goes wild, trying to get out. \nBOSS MAN Fire in the hole! \nBullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots. \nCasings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in. \nPapa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens. Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nAdulterer's eyes widen. \nADULTERER Good christ! They're cannibals! \nCOACH Oh dear... \nP.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \nPapa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nA steady \"thud-thud-thud\" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The group maneuvers to get a better look. \nTRAMPY Oh... my... god. \nPARA What are they doing now? \nP.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \nYes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nBOZO Dude, they're humpin'! \nP.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \nUnlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum cleaner drops from her. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nTrampy VOMITS. \nP.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \nThe slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS have been born. \nPapa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nHeroine's eyes bulge. \nHEROINE Get back! \nSLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front. \nRoadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair. \nBOZO Any more ideas, Animal Planet? \nCOACH I-I-I was just being proactive... \nBEER GUY (to Bozo) Hey, you weren't helpin'! \nBOZO Go douche. \nBARTENDER What the hell now? \nADULTERER We're stuck in here. That's what. \nBozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair. \nRoadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar. \nROADIE Hey, Miss? \nHeroine turns. \nROADIE If you don't mind me asking, how did you run into these things? \nBOSS MAN More importantly, how did you run away from these things? \nHEROINE Well, it all started about forty hours ago... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows... \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nHEROINE It happened fast... \nEXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY \nHeroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop. \nHERO Move it! \nHeroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts. \nTheir loot hits the pavement as they run. \nHERO Get in the car, baby. \nHero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat. \nHero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas pool. Something rises in the gas station. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nHEROINE That's when I saw three others... just for a second. \nEXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET \nThree lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows. \nHERO Roll! \nHeroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the station becomes a FIREBALL. \nINT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS \nHEROINE Close the roof! \nHero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car... \nHERO Shit! \nStripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel. \nThe car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road. \nHERO We made it! \nHero reaches back to give a \"five\" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, HEADLESS body in the back seat. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nHeroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head. \nHEROINE It must have smelled the blood or something. We buried the body and got back on the main road when... \nINT. CAMARO -- NIGHT \nBOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro. \nHeroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield. \nHERO Break! \nHeroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, holding onto the grill. \nHERO Go! Go! Go! \nGrandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel. \nHERO Look out! \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nHEROINE And that's how I ended up here. \nBARTENDER And the head? \nINT. CAMARO -- NIGHT \nThe car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast. \nHEROINE Step up, Chief. \nBOZO So that's how it is? (hands out) Fine! Shotgun, please. \nBartender hands him The Judge. \nBOZO (to Bartender) You're coming with, portly. 'Cause if I'm attacked, I want a fat man close by. \nBARTENDER I'll wait by the door. \nBOZO Now who else is comin'? \nNo one budges. \nGRANDPA (rising from his seat) I'll go with ya. \nBOZO What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon. \nBartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete. \nAt the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants. \nBOZO You! Zorba! You're coming too! (to Heroine) Now gimme the keys. \nHeroine tosses the keys to Bartender. \nHEROINE No. You're locked in. \nBOZO What? \nHEROINE Those two will be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food, I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. \nBOZO Don't get your hopes up. \nBozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow. \nHeroine turns to the bar. \nHEROINE Any volunteers to head into the basement with me? \nTUFFY I will. \nTuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, looking tough and resolute. \nBEER GUY That's not a good idea. \nBOSS MAN With what happened upstairs -- \nTUFFY Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea. (to Heroine) I'm ready. \nHEROINE Alright. \nROADIE Count me in. \nBEER GUY Me too. \nHeroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. The door creaks open slowly. The group descends. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and pulls himself up the staircase like an old man. \nBOZO Alright you two, I don't want to hear any of this, \"oh, I dropped the key, wrong key, ain't no key here.\" When I want out, I want out, ok? \nBARTENDER (displaying keys) They're right here. \nCOACH We've got your back, bro. \nThey unlock the door, swinging it open. \nBOZO Just keep 'em handy, ladies. \nBartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks. \nBOZO Wish me luck... \nWHAM! Bozo is on the ground. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants. \nBOZO Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat! \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBARTENDER If he doesn't shut up... \nCOACH He is human kabob. \nSMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN \nThe room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation. \nBelle pulls away and brushes back her long hair. \nBELLE Doesn't your foot hurt? \nBOSS MAN I can't feel a thing, Hon. \nBELLE (touching his crotch) How 'bout now? \nBOSS MAN You're a bad girl, aren't you. \nBelle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes. \nBELLE Um-hmmm. \nBOSS MAN The girl's got rhythm. \nShe takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts up her skirt and bends over, giggling. \nBOSS MAN There it is. \nBASEMENT \nRoadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor. \nROADIE This is all junk. \nBeer Guy holds a rusted machete. \nBEER GUY This could come in handy. \nHEROINE Let's get everything upstairs. \nHeroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by the arm and takes her aside. \nHEROINE I'm sorry. \nTUFFY Don't worry, I'm fine. Really. \nHEROINE I admire your strength. \nTUFFY Trust me, I plan on having a full breakdown when this is over, but for now, we all have to be strong, right? \nHeroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a LITTLE GIRL. \nHEROINE This is my daughter, Charlie. She's all I'm after. \nTUFFY (fighting back tears) Oh... \nHEROINE And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it. \nTUFFY You have it. \nHEROINE Good. But still do me a favor. \nTUFFY Name it. \nHEROINE (with a wink) Don't tell anyone I have a soft side. \nTUFFY (tiny smile) Deal. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs. \nBOZO Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 10-4. S.O.S. \nBOSS MAN Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!! \nBelle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS. \nBOSS MAN NO! NO! NO! \nBoss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall. \nSister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. \nMAIN BAR \nHeroine and the others, just returning from the basement, hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nCoach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to use his fingernails to turn the metal stump. \nCOACH Great god, why do you damn me?! \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall. \nBOZO GET ME OUTTA HERE!!! \nMAIN BAR \nThe group is mesmerized. \nPARA Oh please, no. \nSMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN \nBoss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric. \nBOSS MAN They're getting in! Somebody help! \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo kicks and punches the door. \nBOZO HELP!!! GODDAMN IT!!! \nMAIN BAR \nHeroine charges up the staircase. Roadie rips the sawed-off weapon from Beer Guy and runs for the kitchen. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBARTENDER The key broke off! \nHEROINE (to Coach) Move it! \nHeroine rips the earring from Bartender's ear. He YELPS. She jams the backing into the lock. \nSMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN \nBoss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a whip-like tongue and snags Boss Man's damaged foot. He howls in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nHeroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort. \nBOZO (O.S.) HELP ME PLEASE!!! \nSMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN \nBoss Man is pulled towards the Sister Beasts. \nBOSS MAN HELLLLLP!!! \nRoadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They dive back out of the room screeching. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBOZO HELLLLLLLLP!!! \nRight behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window. \nPapa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin. \nBOSS MAN Two. \nHEROINE How many can it hold? \nBOSS MAN Six. \nHEROINE Max? \nBOSS MAN Seven. \nHEROINE It's gonna fit thirteen. \nBOSS MAN Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit. \nHEROINE (with hand out) Keys. \nROADIE What're you planning? \nHEROINE Three of us go. Two to defend, one to drive. We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here. \nBOSS MAN Sounds sketchy. \nHEROINE Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die. \nBoss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string around his neck. \nROADIE Give 'em to me, I'm going. \nBARTENDER You're trusting that con? He'll ditch us and never look back. \nROADIE Fuck you too. \nBARTENDER Get in line! \nHEROINE Hey! I'm not trusting him either, that's why I'm going with. \nCoach stands forward. \nCOACH \"Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway.\" (off blank stares) The Duke. I will go. \nHEROINE This is it. They have this place surrounded, but if we go under them we might just make it. \nBARTENDER This is a bottleneck waiting to happen. \nSMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass. \nBOZO This one's great under pressure. I wish you luck. \nHEROINE The rest of you prepare the weapons, whatever you got left. 'Cause when we crash through those walls, we're bringin' death with us. \nHeroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach. \nCOACH No, I don't believe in guns. \nBARTENDER This ain't time for a political stance. \nCoach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy. \nCOACH This doesn't run out of ammo. \nBARTENDER Got ya. \nHeroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement. \nBOZO Hey! \nThe three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod. \nBOZO When you get to that truck... drive it like you stole it. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nAt a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye. \nTRAMPY How does it feel? \nADULTERER Lousy. \nTRAMPY You still have one left. \nADULTERER Yes, the silver lining. \nCOACH They will write stories of your bravery. \nROADIE If there's anybody left. \nThe two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above. \nAt the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK. \nINSIDE KEG ELEVATOR \nHeroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator... \nHEROINE Send it up! Send it up! \nMAIN BAR \nTuffy backs up and hears the screams from the keg elevator. \nTUFFY Hey! Hey! She's in the shaft! \nBeer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull the elevator up to the main floor. \nINSIDE KEG ELEVATOR \nHeroine squirms as the elevator rises. \nHEROINE Move it! Move it! Move it! \nAs Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few planks above her in the keg elevator. \nMAIN BAR \nBeer Guy hits the button. \nBEER GUY Come on! \nBOZO Ol' Crazy Horse has seen it. \nTUFFY Shut up! \nINSIDE KEG ELEVATOR \nThe elevator SHAKES. Heroine POUNDS a hole through the elevator top. She tries to squeeze through the SMALL HOLE. \nTeen Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg elevator. \nCLANGGG! The elevator stops. Heroine lurches and grabs the greasy cables to stop her fall. \nHEROINE Goddamn it! \nMAIN BAR \nTUFFY It stopped. It fuckin' stopped! \nINSIDE KEG ELEVATOR \nHeroine screams as the elevator shakes. Teen Beast is struggling to climb right under her. \nMAIN BAR \nTRAMPY Do something! \nINSIDE KEG ELEVATOR \nHEROINE I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR! \nMAIN BAR \nTuffy moves for the keg door. Adulterer grabs The Judge from Bartender. \nADULTERER Stop! \nTRAMPY What the fuck are you doing?! \nADULTERER They can't get in here! We agreed! They'll get us! \nTUFFY She can make it! \nADULTERER I will not die because of her! \nBARTENDER Don't be stupid, drop the gun! \nThe group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed down the tiny hole. \nHEROINE Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!! \nEveryone struggles to get on the tables. \nCRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor. \nTeen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg... \nPARA HELP ME!!! \nBOZO Bonsai! \nBozo jumps from a table and STOMPS on Teen Beast's arm. He picks up Para and TOSSES him onto a table. \nBOZO Hot potato!!! \nBozo leaps back onto a table. POP! The power cuts out. The room goes black. \nBEER GUY We're gonna die! \nADULTERER What the hell?! \nHEROINE Settle down! \nTRAMPY Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! \nAnd with that, the shouting and pounding stops. The group nervously shuffles around the tables. \nThere's silence. \nDead silence. \nThen, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors maneuver to peek out the front walls. \nBARTENDER What's that? \nTuffy sees what is coming. \nTUFFY They didn't make it. \nEXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nBeing held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams. \nROADIE RUN!!! \nTHUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nThe survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS. \nTHUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood spits through the planks of wood. \nBARTENDER That wall's coming down! \nBOZO Commence Plan B! \nThe entire group goes into motion. \nHEROINE What's Plan B? \nBOZO Just watch the floor and keep the others safe! \nTHUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses. \nBOZO Bomb's away!!! \nFrom the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame. \nPara, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 from the floor. \nThe second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts stay far away. \nTeen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to the floor. \nPara crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, moves in to feed. \nPara points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just as Teen Beast strikes... \nBOZO (overly endearing) I meant to tell you so much! \nThe remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nGrandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters, moving to their table. It moves in for the kill. \nGrandpa kisses his wife gently. \nGRANDPA Close your eyes, hon. \nThe Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast. \nINT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nBOZO YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!! \nBozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar. \nEXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nBozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble. \nBOZO Motherfucker!!! \nBozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN. \nHe hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt. \nCousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife. \nBOZO Lord, if I die, bury me upside down so the world can KISS MY ASS! \nCousin Beast leaps in. \nEXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nThe remaining TWO CARS race down the road. \nINT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nWith the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives. \nBARTENDER I think we're in the clear -- \nBAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers. \nTuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel. \nIN THE BACK \nMomma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck. \nTuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything. \nMomma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second. \nHer remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine. \nMomma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams! \nAnd then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, taking the locket with her. \nHeroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy jumps out. \nTUFFY Are you okay?! \nHEROINE I don't know, I think -- \nADULTERER (O.S.) Hey! \nThey both jump as Adulterer approaches. \nADULTERER Are you two all right? They left! We made it! I think we made it! \nTUFFY They'll be back. \nHEROINE We're safe until dark, but we need to find other people. \nHeroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter. \nTUFFY They're alive! \nThe shudders SMACK against the wall. \nINT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAdulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids. \nHe sighs and puts it down. \nADULTERER I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... \nEXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY \nThe sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches up the street. \nINT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nHeroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings. \nHEROINE It's right up there, in the back of the store. \nEXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS \nThe car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer kneels against his car. \nHEROINE Where is everyone? \nADULTERER I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl? \nHEROINE She's supposed to already be here. \nTUFFY Your family? \nAdulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death. \nTUFFY I'm sorry. \nAdulterer sheepishly nods. \nHEROINE This place is a ghost town. \nThe group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond the glass doors. \nADULTERER (pointing) Look! \nIn the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE stands staring at them. \nHEROINE Charlie? \nHeroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress. \nHEROINE Charlie! \nAs Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm. \nADULTERER Stop! There's something wrong! \nHEROINE Honey!? \nThe group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun. \nTUFFY Oh god. \nThe MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to right, panic stricken. \nCHARLIE Mommy! \nThe sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but Adulterer holds her at bay. \nADULTERER It's a trap! \nAt a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them. \nAdulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer. \nThe darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground. \nADULTERER (gurgling blood) Run!!! \nHeroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast. \n", "test1_input": "HEROINE (points to map) East. Why? \nPARA Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter livestock? \nHEROINE Previous owners did, I think. \nCOACH What are you talking about? \nPARA Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains. \nPara points along the map as he explains. \nPARA Earthquakes often cracked the piping and those flow lines were condemned, but never drained. \nCOACH Cheese n' rice... \nTRAMPY I still don't get it. \nPARA What I am saying is... there's a distinct possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream of blood and tissue that has been leaking into the caves. And a day ago... something broke out. \nThe group is silent. \nBOZO The first order of business is gettin' a big fuckin' tampon in that cave! \nPARA Nope, that wouldn't do it. \nFROM ADULTERER'S P.O.V. - He peeks out the hole and sees nothing but the dark night. Bartender eyes him. \nBARTENDER I wouldn't do that. \nBOZO They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road, they'd be easy pickings. \nHEROINE (to Adulterer) Careful. \nADULTERER I'm telling you, I don't see a thing -- \nBOINK! Papa Beast's claw POKES into his eye. Adulterer JERKS away holding his blood squirting eye socket. \nFROM OUTSIDE \nP.O.V. - The eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to the floor holding his face. \nINSIDE \nCoach and Trampy move to help Adulterer. \nFROM OUTSIDE \nThe eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP! \nINSIDE \nBASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS Coach's pants and boxers. He screams and lunges forward. He is BOTTOMLESS. \nHEROINE Everyone stay in the middle of the room! Off the walls! NOW! \nEveryone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room. \nBelle hands Coach a little menu to cover himself with. \nHEROINE Now, does everyone agree that they are still out there? \nThe group nods. \nHEROINE (to Bozo) 'Eh, Chief? \nBOZO ...Duh. \nTrampy holds Adulterer's wounded head. \nTRAMPY He's out cold. \nBELLE I know some first aid if we have a kit. Do we? \nBOSS MAN In the kitchen, under the sink. \nHEROINE No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed. \nTUFFY (to Coach) There's some sweats in my bag behind the bar. \nCOACH Thanks. \n", "test1_true": "ROADIE You're a clever man. (re: Bozo) Why do you take shit from him? \nPARA Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera. \nROADIE Your brother, huh? \nPARA Yep. \nROADIE Same parents? \nPARA Look man, I read books. He reads bumper stickers. \nRoadie nods. Heroine jerks a bottle of booze from Beer Guy and tosses it out. \nHEROINE Alright, we need to stay alert and for everyone to take a role. (to Boss Man) You gotta have some guns or weapons around here. \nBoss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his foot raised. \nBOSS MAN I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I have locker with a sawed-off and some gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes of shells. \nBARTENDER I got shells, too. Box and a half tops. Machete behind the bar. \nHEROINE Okay, well that's something. \nROADIE So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks. \nBeer Guy scans the stocked bar wall. \nBEER GUY I might be able to do something with the bottles. \nGRANDPA You're gonna need a whole lot more than that to get outta here alive. \nThe crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife. \nBOZO Oh, now you have something to say? \nGrandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks. \nGRANDPA You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy. \nBOZO Oh? And what's that? \nGRANDPA Sit still, look less like a meal. \nBOZO That's for bears and sharks, chunky chew. \nThe group looks back to Heroine. \nHEROINE Alright, what else do we have? Can we somehow contact the outside world? \nTrampy pensively stays on her fractured phone. \nTRAMPY I can't get anybody. I don't even know if I have a signal anymore. \nBEER GUY I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here. \nBARTENDER Who the hell would you call? \nBEER GUY Anyone. \nBOZO Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there, you get eaten. You stay in here, you get eaten. Anyone comes to help, they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie? \nBEER GUY Then I guess we should just give up. \nBOZO (re: Trampy) Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch, but it's not in the cards, partner. \nHEROINE (to Boss Man) You said you had a short wave radio. \nTRAMPY Where? \nBARTENDER Upstairs. \nBOSS MAN Go for it. It's by the far wall. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. \nHEROINE Good. I'm heading to the basement for supplies. (to Bozo) And you're going upstairs. \nBozo blinks. A little taken aback. \nBOZO Let's not get carried away... \n", "test2_input": "ROADIE Shhhhhhhhhhhhh. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nTuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. \nBozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand. \nBOZO Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong! \nBEER GUY What do you know? \nBOZO I know you're doing it wrong. \nBEER GUY Prove it. \nBozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles. \nBOZO Move aside, princess. \nINT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT \nThe tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering system. There is about six inches of water on the floor. \nCOACH (to Roadie) You and I are similar. We both have accents. We both travel a lot. We both don't really have homes... \nROADIE You should be quiet. \nCOACH I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous. \nHEROINE Quiet. \nCoach bites his lip, dying to say something. \nCOACH It's just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly... offed. \nROADIE What did I say? \nCOACH Sorry. I'm done now. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nBozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles. \nBOZO You don't want the rag touching booze, that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it. \nPARA You sure? I thought the rag had to touch? \nBOZO I'm sure. \nBozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer. \nBOZO Perfecto. What we should do, though, is put those peanut barrels to use. Fill 'em with booze and line up some planks. If the walls come down... we hit 'em Donkey Kong style. \nPara and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect for bomb-making. \nPARA Genius. \nBEER GUY You aren't nearly as dumb as you look, are you? \nBOZO Next time, look within. Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful. \nBozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder. \nBOZO Excuse me for being forward, but I'm curious about your dimensions. \nINT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT \nRoadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down. \nROADIE Hold up. You hear something? \nA SCRATCHING sound is heard from above. \nROADIE They're trying to burrow through the tunnel walls. \nHEROINE Move. \nThe scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well. \nCOACH Like moles these things. \n", "test2_true": "She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her. \nROADIE Duck! \nRoadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his shot. \nROADIE Stay down! \nFrom her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face. \nHEROINE Go! The bitch is mine! \nRoadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend with the Beast. \nHeroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well. \nHeroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth with the gun, knocking her back. \nSister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm. \nHeroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others. \nHEROINE Look out! \nRoadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks. \nRoadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles. \nROADIE The shells are wet! \nWith the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach looks around, seeing a plan. \nCOACH Grab onto ceiling and get out of water! \nROADIE What? \nCOACH Do it!!! \nGrabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end. \nCOACH (to Heroine) Get out of water!!! \nHeroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came. \nAs the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait for Heroine to get out of the water. \nThe second she does, he jams the cord into the water. \nZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke rises from their cooked bodies. \nRoadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel. \nINT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nHeroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters the basement. \nGAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill. \nHeroine raises her weapon. \nHEROINE You fuck with my family. (aiming shotgun) I fuck right back! \nClick -- out of ammo! \nHEROINE Oh shit. \nHeroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE. \nShe rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers. \nShe swings again but gets whacked to the floor. \nHeroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives into the KEG ELEVATOR. \nShe slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door. \nINT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT \nRoadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit. \n", "test3_input": "The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent. \nHEROINE She's still out here. \nHeroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes. \nHEROINE Stay put. \nShe creeps out alone. \nHEROINE Where are you... come on... \nNothing. Just smoke. And silence. \nHEROINE Come on! Come on! \nFrom the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull. \nAt the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering the back. \nINSIDE TRUCK \nHeroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She advances, hissing. \nHEROINE Come and get me you blood-chugging CUNT! \nMomma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors. \nOUTSIDE TRUCK \nBeer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck. \nTRAMPY You got her? You got her! \nHEROINE Not for long, we gotta burn it. \nHeroine looks to the others at the breach. \nHEROINE Come on! Let's blow this thing! \nThe others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck. \nBEER GUY When this lights, run like hell. \nAbout fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine. \nHEROINE (catching lighter) Here we go... \nThen, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! \nA deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck. \nIt's Momma Beast. Again and again. \nTUFFY What is that? \nHEROINE She's calling for help. \nHeroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the fire with his foot. \nBOZO The fan has officially been buried in the shit. \nInstantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. The group gasps. Trampy backs away. \nTRAMPY We have to run -- \nBURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma Beast emerges. \nHEROINE Get to your cars!!! \nThe Beasts spring into action, chasing the group. \nBozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast RIPS Para from Bozo's back. \nBOZO Motherfucker! Give him back! \nBozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still alive.

Beer Guy lags behind, continually looking over his shoulder. \nADULTERER Run and quit looking back! \nAs Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his Trans-Am. \nBOZO DO IT! \nVAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape. \nThe \"MIAMI VICE\" theme song blares from the speakers. \nBOZO Get me FUCK BIRDS! \nBozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path. \nBOZO No you don't! \nBAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's disemboweled body sailing through the air. \nBOZO VENGEANCE! \nPara DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting.

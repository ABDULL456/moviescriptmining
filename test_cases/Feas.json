{"test1_input": "FEAST \nWritten by \nPatrick Melton & Marcus Dunston \nRevised Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill. \nFar in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES perched on a barren tree watch the intruders. \nEXT. DESERT -- DAY \nThe truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut and naive). \nChief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth before them. \nCHIEF This is it. \nLANKY Why did it have to be these caves... \nCOLLEGE BOY Is something wrong? \nLANKY (to College Boy) Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'. \nChief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck. \nThe logo on the rear gate reads \"WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT.\" \nCHIEF Let's get that first barrel. \nThe gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol. \nINT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER \nCollege Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men. \nCOLLEGE BOY What's with the awkward silence? \nLANKY You don't know? \nCollege Boy shakes his head \"no\" and they set the cart down. \nCHIEF Last winter, a man kidnapped a little girl and holed up in one of these caves. The cops had him pinned down and began to move in. This guy started shooting... but he wasn't aiming at the officers... (getting closer) ...he was firing at something inside. \nCollege Boy is rapt. \nCHIEF When the dust cleared, all they found was the little girl's shoes. (beat) With the feet still in 'em. \nSomething GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump. \nCOLLEGE BOY Ahh!!! \nLanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed. \nCOLLEGE BOY Assholes. \nCHIEF Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself when my boss pulled that one on me. \nLANKY I went well beyond nearly. \nThen, a sound. All eyes turn. \nCHIEF What was that? \nCOLLEGE BOY Once was plenty, fellas. \nCHIEF Shhhh... \nAs Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe. \nInstantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams. \nMEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around her neck. She charges towards Chief. \nMEAN GREEN Stop it right there! You will not rape Mother Nature one more day! \n", "test1_true": "CHIEF Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! \nIn unison, the hippies start CHANTING. \nHIPPIE GROUP Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-more/Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't dump in her any- more... \nA BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks. \nCHIEF Take it easy! We have a permit! \nMEAN GREEN (handing a document) And we have an injunction from the State to prevent any dumping in these caverns! This is virgin land! The aqueducts in these caves bring drinking water to our families, and its piping provides drainage for our farms that enrich this barren land! And it won't be tainted by waste of any kind! Not now! Not ever! \nChief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back. \nCHIEF Fine, just back off! \nHe snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel. \nCHIEF Let's roll... Now-now-now! \nBacking away, looking to Mean Green. \nCHIEF How do you guys always know where we're going? \nMEAN GREEN (with a smirk) I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT! \nHastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave. \nMEAN GREEN Score one for the green team!!! \nThe hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their truck and peel away. \nBEARDED CAMERAMAN Hey, man, that was righteous, but I need a shot with the sign up. \nAt the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall. \nMEAN GREEN We saved you today, ol' gal. \nFuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach in the rock wall. \nFUZZY Oh, fuck! \nMEAN GREEN Sister, why do you always swing for the fences? \nFUZZY (eyeing breach) It's okay, but I... I think I see something in there... something shiny. \nFuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer. \nFUZZY Oh my, it looks like diamonds! \nCHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies. \nBearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach. \nFuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles forward. \nMean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't. \nOne by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death. \nRipping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls. \nBearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him. \nMEAN GREEN Give me the keys!!! \nBearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing both his arms. \nMean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She HAMMERS at the chain around her waist. \nFoot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she BREAKS the chain, popping herself free. \nShe spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK! \nSomething grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK... \nCUT TO BLACK: \nSUPERIMPOSED: BASED ON A TRUE STORY \n", "test1_id": 2775, "test2_input": "Heroine sighs a gust of relief. \nREPORTER But always remember, don't look straight into the sun because a special filter is needed to avoid damaging your cornea. \nThe Reporter beams. \nREPORTER And we're all looking forward to it tomorrow. Back to you. \nIn the studio, the Newscaster smirks. \nNEWSCASTER Thank you. And in other news... \nRoadie points to the TV. \nROADIE That studio's local, we can call in. \nBOSS MAN I have a short wave radio upstairs. \nTrampy is already dialing on the cell. \nTRAMPY I'm calling them... it's ringing! \nROADIE They'd have a police scanner. \nTRAMPY (into cell) Hello? Yes, we're at the United -- \nON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine. \nNEWSCASTER ...it has been reported that the power outage -- \nA Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast cuts out, turning to static. \nTrampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact. \nTRAMPY Oh no! Oh fucking no! \nHeroine, tense, quells the rising panic. \nHEROINE Keep it together! I came from the east. That studio is south of here. For all we know, north and west are okay. \nROADIE An associate of mine was coming in from the north, ain't heard a word from him in hours. \nHEROINE So, that leaves the west. \nTuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat. \nTUFFY And Red Mountain. Your daughter. \nHeroine looks over, making eye contact. \nHEROINE Right. \nBEER GUY This is goddamn depressing. \nAt the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun. \nBOSS MAN I've got some tools and extra planks in the kitchen, if we're on the same page here. \nHEROINE Let's work. \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nThe last board is hammered into place as the survivors back away from the now re-enforced bar. \nBARTENDER We'll it ain't pretty... \nBOSS MAN But its got teeth. \nBAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler. \nBOZO I think it's hungry again. \nHEROINE We have to kill it. (to Boss Man) Can you help? \nBoss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior Beast goes wild, trying to get out. \nBOSS MAN Fire in the hole! \nBullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots. \nCasings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in. \n", "test2_true": "RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps. \nMoving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves the barrel into a hole. \nBLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething. \nTUFFY You're welcome. \nShe hands the shotgun back to Bartender. \nTRAMPY Jesus, it took all that? All those bullets? How can we possibly fight off the others? \nHEROINE Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears and mouth. From what I've seen, it's their only weakness. \nROADIE (looking at the corpse) Looks like they're soft on the inside like any other animal. Trick is to get in there and do the damage. \nBELLE Maybe we don't have to fight them. \nBOZO Right, let's just call 'em names. \nCoach steps forward, poised to make the sale. \nCOACH Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention. \nThe bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man. \nCOACH We have to think outside the box here. We don't need to fight them, we need to scare them. Scare them right back. This is a species stand- off. We just need to show them we're not vulnerable. That we're formidable. \nADULTERER How? \nCOACH I need a stick. \nBartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick. \nCOACH Stand back. \nHe buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall. \nCOACH Let's get that board down. \nRoadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole. \nHEROINE What are you doing? \nCoach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside. \nCOACH Showing superiority. The scent of their dead may drive them away. \nThe whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely able to see anything. \nBEER GUY I don't see them. \nCOACH Come on. Come onnnnnn. \nBELLE Is there a call, or something? \nBOZO See that you monkey fucks! That's what you get when you mess with us! Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! Shit don't make me gay because you'll be sucking my dick! \nBozo's insult hangs in the air. \nPARA Sweet... \nP.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \nWHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike. \nINT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS \nCoach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child. \nSilhouettes of the other family members slowly approach Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing. \nBEER GUY It's working. I think it's working. \nCOACH You see? What I tell you? \nThe whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS. \nP.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES \n", "test2_id": 2776, "test3_input": "HEROINE Step up, Chief. \nBOZO So that's how it is? (hands out) Fine! Shotgun, please. \nBartender hands him The Judge. \nBOZO (to Bartender) You're coming with, portly. 'Cause if I'm attacked, I want a fat man close by. \nBARTENDER I'll wait by the door. \nBOZO Now who else is comin'? \nNo one budges. \nGRANDPA (rising from his seat) I'll go with ya. \nBOZO What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon. \nBartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete. \nAt the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants. \nBOZO You! Zorba! You're coming too! (to Heroine) Now gimme the keys. \nHeroine tosses the keys to Bartender. \nHEROINE No. You're locked in. \nBOZO What? \nHEROINE Those two will be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food, I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. \nBOZO Don't get your hopes up. \nBozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow. \nHeroine turns to the bar. \nHEROINE Any volunteers to head into the basement with me? \nTUFFY I will. \nTuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, looking tough and resolute. \nBEER GUY That's not a good idea. \nBOSS MAN With what happened upstairs -- \nTUFFY Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea. (to Heroine) I'm ready. \nHEROINE Alright. \nROADIE Count me in. \nBEER GUY Me too. \nHeroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. The door creaks open slowly. The group descends. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and pulls himself up the staircase like an old man. \nBOZO Alright you two, I don't want to hear any of this, \"oh, I dropped the key, wrong key, ain't no key here.\" When I want out, I want out, ok? \nBARTENDER (displaying keys) They're right here. \nCOACH We've got your back, bro. \nThey unlock the door, swinging it open. \nBOZO Just keep 'em handy, ladies. \nBartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks. \nBOZO Wish me luck... \nWHAM! Bozo is on the ground. \n", "test3_true": "BOZO (O.S.) I'm okay! I'm okay! \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor. \nBOZO Come on. Come on. Come on. \nBozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room. \nBOZO Geeezzzus. (moving gingerly) Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps. \nMAIN BAR \nBelle kneels next to the Boss Man. \nBELLE How are you holding up? \nBOSS MAN Well... \nHe pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her. \nBELLE What is this? \nBOSS MAN Morphine. My magic potion. I need a few drops. \nShe puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue. \nBOSS MAN You should try a little, it'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm. \nBELLE No other time than now, right? \nBOSS MAN Wait, before you do that, help me move. There's a small room off the kitchen where I can lay down. \nBELLE But -- \nBOSS MAN It's much safer in there. Trust me. \nBASEMENT \nThe basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into the dark corners. \nROADIE Stay on your toes everybody. \nTuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels next to a hatch door that emits a red glow. \nHEROINE What's this? \nRoadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut. \nROADIE You don't need to know what that is. \nBeer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it. \nBEER GUY There's a sawed-off shotgun in here. \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door. \nCOACH Come on, bro. \nBehind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS upward. \nSECOND FLOOR \nBozo moves turtle slow. \nBOZO Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze. \nHe moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and... \nCREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards. \nBOZO HAAAA! \nOUTSIDE THE DOOR \nBartender and Coach jump back. \n", "test3_id": 2777}

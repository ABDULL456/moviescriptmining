MOSES BEHE I knew it. You know that devil took my Ruth. 
ZOIL And Ruth's your daughter? 
MOSES BEHE That's right. Her Mama died when she was born. I good as brought her up by myself. Wasn't easy either. Two mouths to feed and this place to run. 
ZOIL I understand. Do you have a photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe? MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes intact and with dark hair. 
ZOIL She's pretty. MOSES snorts. 
ZOIL Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In case she tries to contact you. 
MOSES BEHE I do... ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his satellite phone, moving into a different room. 
MOSES BEHE ...and she'll call me if she can. Ruth's never really been outta Carbon County. 
ZOIL You say they went East? 
MOSES BEHE Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ain't using the interstate, there's been a rig spill just South of Dutch John. 
ZOIL So? 
MOSES BEHE So that means they'll be on the 44. Only way to go. ZOIL looks at O'REILLY. 
ZOIL Let's go. Haggard! 
MOSES BEHE Tell me you're gonna kill that thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what it is. 
ZOIL We'll do our best, Mr. Behe. 
MOSES BEHE Watch yourself now. I seen its eyes. It's evil. ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them. 
MOSES BEHE God's speed, Mr. Zoil. 
EXT. RV PARK - DAY 
ZOIL's radio crackles to life. 
HAGGARD (O.S.) Man, that way was one fat freak! 
O'REILLY (O.S.) If I was that girl, I think I'd rather take my chances with the alien. HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter. 
ZOIL Can it, you two! How many times do I have to tell you? 
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY 
MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over the radio. 
ZOIL (O.S.) We do not refer to the target as "Â˜The Alien'. MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying in the foreground on the kitchen table. We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously. 
EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY 
MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder. 
PAUL Wow. Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE, looking out through the RV's windshield. We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty. They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking out across the vista. 
PAUL There it is, boys. Wyoming. 
CLIVE Is that where we're going? 
PAUL Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. I mean look at it. Hey Ruth, get up here. They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone. 
PAUL Ruth!? 
CLIVE Someone should go after her. Graham? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone. 
CLIVE Graham!? 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
RUTH is storming up the road. 
GRAHAM Ruth! 
RUTH Leave me alone! 
GRAHAM Ruth, please stop, I've got shin splints. RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.

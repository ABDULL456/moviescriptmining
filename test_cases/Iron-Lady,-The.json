{"train": "THE IRON LADY \nWritten by \nAbi Morgan \nAuthor's Note: References to \"PRESENT\" mean the undifferentiated years of the recent past (not 2011). \nINT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. \nThe HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of Indian music - MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk. The electronic PEEP of the cash til. A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes her place second in the queue. The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat. \nMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER One forty-nine please. \nMARGARET How much is the milk? \nMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER Forty-nine pence. (taking the change) Thank you. MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man wired into an ipod. \nEXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. \nMARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in hand. \nINT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS, sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her head. \nMARGARET Too much. Much too much butter. \nDENIS I like butter. MARGARET Milk's gone up. \nMARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding it down on a table. MARGARET (CONT'D) 49p a pint. DENIS Good grief! We'll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. (chuckles) Or take in paying guests! He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door - DENIS (CONT'D) Watch out. She's on the prowl. MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a distant corridor, steady on the approach. MARGARET (to DENIS) Eat your egg. JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now sitting tapping open her egg. JUNE Goodness! There you are. JUNE's look of quiet concern. MARGARET Yes. MARGARET eats her egg. MARGARET (CONT'D) Here we are. But for JUNE, she is entirely alone. \nINT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. \nWHISPERING- \nJUNE I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important - \nMARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER. \nJUNE (CONT'D) Please just make it really clear. Who's on after you? \nPOLICE GUARD Dixon. \nMARGARET slips away. \nINT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY. \nMARGARET hurries through the hall. \nINT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY. \nA wide cupboard- \nMARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her, her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill. \nJUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back, letting in the sunlight- \nJUNE Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it. \nThe smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill- \nHe reaches for a suit. \nMARGARET Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there. \nSuddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary carrying a cardboard box. \nSUSIE Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ? (concerned) How are you feeling ? \nMARGARET I'm fine, thank you Susie. \nSUSIE I've just been reading about the bombings. \nMARGARET Yes. Frightful. \nSUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to switch it off. \nSUSIE Sorry. \nSUSIE (CONT'D) These are the books for you to sign. I brought as many as I could find. Shall we go through your appointments? \nMARGARET looks at her still nonplussed. \nSUSIE (CONT'D) We said we'd go through them today. \nMARGARET nods- \nMARGARET Yes, of course, dear. Today. \nSUSIE The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month. \nThe murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise- \nSUSIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I said no because you've got a concert that afternoon but if you'd like to..? \nSILENCE- \nSUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D) ....It looks like a very interesting programme. \nMARGARET's listens, oddly distracted- \nMARGARET What are they playing? \nSUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles back through the diary- \nSUSIE I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein. \n`SHALL WE DANCE' FROM `THE KING & I\" SUDDENLY BREAKING THROUGH AS IF FROM ANOTHER TIME CARRYING INTO.... \nINT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT. \nAn orchestra in full flight- \nA programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's hand reaches in and her hands slips into his. \nINT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. \nWhilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window. \nMARGARET Silly man. \nMARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street below. He looks up, smiles, \nMARGARET (CONT'D) He hasn't got his scarf on. \nMARGARET glances up at her father serving further down the counter. \nALFRED (O.S.) What is the life blood of any community? It's business.... \nINT. HALL. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY \nALFRED on a small town hall stage behind a makeshift podium. \nALFRED Not just big business but small businesses, like mine. \nThe SOFT press of MEN all around, MARGARET, a lone woman amongst them, peering over shoulders. \nBEATRICE (passing/hushed aside) Margaret! \nBEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand. \nBEATRICE (CONT'D) CUPS! \nMARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances back at ALFRED just visible on a stage. \nALFRED We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Sometimes we're plain bloody minded. \nNOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea and washing up cups. \nALFRED (CONT'D) But we also believe in helping each other. And I don't mean by state hand-outs... \nEXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY. \nMARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the street at- \nTHREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement. \nPRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1 Margaret, do you want to come to the pictures? \nMARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and GIGGLING. \nPRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 She can't come, she's got to study. \nThe FLUSH of MARGARET'S skin - \nPRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 (CONT'D) Miss Hoity Toity! \nThe STING OF EMBARRASSMENT. \nTHE SENSE OF THE PRETTY GIRLS WHISPERING ABOUT HER, EYES TRAVELLING OVER her disparagingly. \nALFRED (V.O.) Never run with the crowd, Margaret. Go your own way. \nThe SWAY of a SKIRT as they walk away. \nALFRED OOV (close to) Open it then. \nINT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY. \nClose on a telegram addressed to MARGARET ROBERTS, 1-3 North Parade, Grantham. \nMARGARET'S father ALFRED, watching. \nMARGARET (looking up) I've got a place at Oxford. \nALFRED bear-hugs MARGARET awkwardly. \nA phone rings, O.S. \nMARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and confronts the extraordinary head-gear. \nMARGARET What have you got on your head? \nDENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously- \nDENIS Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress? \nMARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones almost audible. \nMARGARET You look ridiculous. \nMARGARET strains to hear- \nDENIS Bosslady no like? \nShe makes a shushing motion. \nMARGARET (as if to a bad dog) No, Denis, Bosslady no like. \nMARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of life just audible outside- \nJUNE (O.S) It's taken Carol so long to get her to agree to this. She's been so reluctant to let his things go. \nDENIS sinks onto the bed, bored. \nMARGARET (without looking) Feet. \nHe tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don't dirty the bedspread. \nMARGARET stands, ear pressed close to the open door- \nJUNE (O.S) You can never be sure she's taking her medication...I think sometimes she hides them.. \nDENIS VO Oh, rumbled! \nMARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills resting in the tea cup. \nShe considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks. \nJUNE (O.S) She's definitely more distracted than usual today. \nINT/EXT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. \nA shout in the street. A woman's voice. \nCAROL OOV Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car. \nMargaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi, remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and waving her credit card at him with rising irritation. \nCAROL OOV (CONT'D) Well then take the sticker off! I call that false advertising! I would say keep the change, but there isn't any change. \nINT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. \nA scotch being poured. The cap not quite going back on the whisky bottle. A frantic fumble for the remotes for the tv. \nCAROL OOV Hello June, any news? I've brought every bag I could find. \nHigh shot of MARGARET sitting in a chair watching TV. As if she has been there a while. \nINT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING. \nDENIS whispers. \nDENIS VO ...and work your way in. \nA long table packed with silverware. She looks back at her ornate and rather hideous starter, a tiny wobbling savoury confection in aspic. \nPORTLY HOST ...Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words. \nGREY SUITED MAN They'll be nationalizing the bloody air next. \nMALE GUEST Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's government property! \nPORTLY HOST So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts? \nMARGARET Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of Grantham. \nPORTLY HOST And a grocer as well! \nMARGARET Yes. \nEars prick up around the table. The Host is lost for something to say. \nHOSTESS And did you help, err, in the...shop? \nMARGARET Oh, yes. It was a family business. \nGREY SUITED MAN A very good starting point for the political life, I'm sure. \nMARGARET That and a degree from Oxford. \nThe put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to smile. \nMARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork, working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres. \nINT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING. \nMARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers. \nMARGARET (hushed aside to WAITER) Whisky. \nThe MURMUR of conversation all around- \nINT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING. \nPudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her theme. \nMARGARET What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do, they must just get up and do. And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and DO something about it, change things. \nThe female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from someone. \nPORTLY HOST With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham- \nMARGARET Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too. \nMALE GUEST Really? \nA general sense of quiet incredulity. \nMARGARET I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income. Just like the man or woman on the street, when I am short one week, I have to make economies the next. \nMARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away as another couple approach. \nMARGARET You don't mind if I sit down... \nSitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's hand. \nFEMALE GUEST I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself. \nMARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering- \nMARGARET It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone. \nThe FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside her, waiting to depart. \nFEMALE GUEST Well anyway, I...thank you. \nMARGARET Good night to you. \nMARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of Carol saying final farewells. \nCAROL (O.S.) Great to see you, thank you very much for coming. \nMALE GUEST (O.S.) Oh, thank you. It was lovely, absolutely lovely. And I'm so pleased to see your mother looking so well. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT.NIGHT. \nA mirror lined dressing room- \nCAROL helps MARGARET with her shoes. \nCAROL OK...hold on to me...that's right. \nMARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls \nMARGARET Can you do the clasp, I can't quite - \nCAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes. Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls- \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Thank you. \nCAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to MARGARET, staring back at their reflections. \nCAROL You've got an eyelash. \nCAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger, holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile- \nCAROL (CONT'D) Make a wish. \nMARGARET, closes her eyes until- \nMARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles. \nCAROL (CONT'D) I spoke to Doctor Michael today- \nMARGARET glances away, deflecting. \nCAROL (CONT'D) He is very good and very expensive- \nMARGARET ignores her- \nCAROL (CONT'D) ...I know you're not due to see him for another month but I've spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow. \nMARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery. \nMARGARET Disaster. \nDENIS Hang on...Hang on...Hang on... \nDENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around. \nDENIS (CONT'D) You shaved thousands off their majority. You did splendidly. \nMARGARET Not splendidly enough. \nDENIS Ah I see. Self pity. \nMARGARET eyes him, mid chip- \nDENIS (CONT'D) No one is saying you don't need a safe seat. You deserve a safe seat. But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little. \nMARGARET What game? \nShe is fuming but he regroups with a big breath. \nDENIS You are a grocer's daughter- \nMARGARET (fiercely) -And proud of being- \nHe grabs her hand, silencing her. \nDENIS - in their eyes. A single grocer's daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman- \nFor the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise. \nDENIS (CONT'D) You'd get to parliament, and I'd get to be the happiest man in- in wherever they select you. (SILENCE) Margaret, will you marry me? \nShe is genuinely stunned. \nDENIS (CONT'D) Well ? \nShe is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head and smile. \nMARGARET Yes. Yes! \nHe leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until- \nDENIS What ? \nMARGARET I love you so much but...I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter. \nDENIS (trying to retain the moment) We'll get a help for that. \nHe leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a little. \nMARGARET No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup. \nHe sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first time. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) I mean it Denis, say you understand. \nDENIS That's why I want to marry you, my dear. \nShe kisses him. \nHEATH (CONT'D) I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation. \nMINISTER 1 Hear hear, Prime Minister. \nMARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes. \nHEATH - the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors. (Finally acknowledging Margaret) Yes, Education Secretary. \nMARGARET Yes... \nAll eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in her voice. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation. \nSUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT. \nA lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'. \nHEATH Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute. \nA beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness. MARGARET holds the small torch. \nHEATH (CONT'D) Thank you, Margaret. \nA snigger, then the lights flicker back on. \nHEATH (CONT'D) Your thoughts are duly noted. \nMARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head, `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look as she's caught by a memory. \nALFRED (O.S.) We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers. \nINT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT. The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on stage. \nALFRED He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us. \nThe crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst, YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow. \nALFRED (CONT'D) We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow. \nINT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays. \nVOICE ON THE RADIO It's 1974 and you'd think it was WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess. Heath should resign now and make way for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions. \nCAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through. \nCAROL I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky. MARGARET Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) One must be brave if one is to take the wheel- \nCAROL Right-o. \nMARGARET Move over... Move to your right a little bit... \nCAROL But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road? \nMARGARET Carol! \nCAROL Well he's in the way! \nMARGARET To the right. Move to the right! A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone CYCLIST- MARGARET (CONT'D) So sorry! Terribly sorry! MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic. \nNEWS V.O. The Irish National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the death of Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher's spokesman on Northern Ireland. \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT. \nMARGARET on the conference podium, blinking back tears. Behind her, Denis' face etched with the same sorrow. \nINT. STEPS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY \nMARGARET walks alone down the grand stairway, sombre, deep in thought. \nINT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. \nMARGARET looks up from the photograph, tears in her eyes. \nAIREY NEAVE (V.O.) If you want to change the party, lead it. (MORE) \nAIREY NEAVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) If you want to change the country, lead it. You've got it in you to go the whole distance! \nOn MARGARET as memories flood in. A TV headline announces: ELECTION 1979. \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT \nMARGARET on the podium. \nMARGARET Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help. That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much. And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win! \nThe black streak of MARGARET'S car, a blur of colour, faces, waving flags - \nTV footage of polling night. Swingometers, pollsters, impressionistic snatches of reported speech. \nMore footage of PEOPLE coming out of polling stations. \nJubilant crowds applauding.. \nMARGARET, silhouetted in her iconic stance, arms aloft... \nINT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY. \nMARGARET peering out of the window, hands sunk in the lap, a flash of the Royal blue fabric of her skirt, clenched in fingers. \nNEWS READER (V.O.) It's Friday the 4th of May, an historic day for Britain, a Conservative government led by Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead - \nNEWS READER 2 (V.O.) Mrs Ghandi in India, but never in the West has there been a woman Prime Minister. \nNEW READER 3 (V.O.) The place that she has secured in British history, as the first woman ever to be invited to form a government. (MORE) \nNEW READER 3 (V.O.)

BANNERS read `We LOVE YOU MAGGIE' blur through the window, an abstract cacophony of noise and colour- \nDENIS This is it, steady the buffs old girl. \nHe clasps her hand for a moment as MARGARET smiles at him. \nThe door swings open- \nEXT. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY. \nThe CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side- \nMARGARET I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi: Where there is discord may we bring harmony... Where there is error may we bring truth... Where there is doubt may we bring faith... Where there is despair may we bring hope.. \nINT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK. MARGARET pours herself a whiskey. DENIS looms close, serves a splash of soda. DENIS I know you can hear me, sweetheart, so there's no use pretending you can't. MARGARET turns, ignoring him. \nMARGARET Enough. Denis, enough! \nDENIS (saluting) Dismissed! \nINT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK. MARGARET sits reading DENIS' spy novel. DENIS She does it in the end. Kills him- MARGARET slams the book closed. DENIS (CONT'D) I don't know why you're being so scratchy. MARGARET's eyes dart to the clock. DENIS (CONT'D) It's not as if you've got anyone else to talk to. \nShaking her head, MARGARET tries to block him out. \nMARGARET (V.O.) When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride - \nDENIS You know, it's a marvel to me that you can still quote huge chunks of Kipling but try remembering the name of that woman who's just made you that godawful cold collation... No? Come on... you can do it... month of the year... one syllable... rhymes with moon MARGARET (sudden/like a lightbulb) June. MARGARET turns to DENIS, a quiet appalling victory. DENIS June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there in the end. \"When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride, He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside, but the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail. For the female of the species is more deadly than the male...\" As he continues, MARGARET reaches for the remote, turns the television on. She moves onto the radio. Then the stereo. She moves on, talking to herself- A gradual growing cacophony of sound- \nINT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK. MARGARET flicks on mixers, radios, toasters- \nINT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK. The noise almost unbearable now- MARGARET turns on a hi-fi, the TV now on- \nMARGARET If I can't hear you then I can't see you. And if I can't see you then you are not here. MARGARET closes her eyes. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) And if you are not here, I am not going mad. I will not...I will not go mad. She opens them and suddenly freezes on seeing an image of herself, bewildered and leaving Harley Street, caught on the TV- BBC VOICEOVER Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her doctor today. Although rarely seen in public, Lady Thatcher, the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century, remains a controversial figure. MARGARET turns up the volume to full, trying to hear over the cacophony of noise the changing images on the TV illuminating her pale face. JUNE Margaret- \nMARGARET barely sees her, eyes riveted to the TV. \nBBC VOICE OVER Almost lovingly dubbed by the Soviets The Iron Lady, she's also credited, with her friend Ronald Reagan, with a decisive role in the ending of the Cold War. Her supporters claim she transformed the British economy and reversed the country's post-war decline. Her detractors blame her savage public spending cuts and sweeping privatization of - JUNE moves like a dervish through the house, muting the television and turning off the last of the appliances- A gradual silence descends until- MARGARET takes in the image of herself on the mute screen, standing bewildered on the steps of Harley Street. MARGARET (almost to self) I don't recognize myself. \nINT. BATHROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT. \nThe shelf of a bathroom cabinet. Shaving brush. Razor. Medicaments. MARGARET begins to pull them all off the shelves. \nDENIS (O.S.) Am I out of the doghouse yet? \nThen a pair of glasses. More gently, MARGARET'S hand reaches into the cupboard and takes the glasses in her hand. \nINT. BEDROOM. HOUSE.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT. MARGARET lies in bed, book in her lap, DENIS beside her reading the paper. She closes the book and pulls off her reading glasses. MARGARET They're unveiling that portrait of me at Number 10 next month. The invitation's on the mantelpiece. So there'll be Churchill, Lloyd George and me. Just the three of us. SILENCE- MARGARET (CONT'D) I said I didn't want any big fuss but they insisted.. \nSILENCE- Lovely little article in The Telegraph... The Woman Who Changed the Face of History.. SILENCE- \nVoices from the past intrude - \nFOOT VO Less than two years ago, the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis and talked about bringing faith, hope and harmony to this country. MARGARET suddenly reaches out a hand, her hand shaking- MARGARET Denis? She turns in bed. Sudden panic, DENIS is gone- \nA HECKLING CHAMBER RISING THROUGH- \nINT. CHAMBERS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY. \nA HECKLING chamber as MARGARET sits, facing LABOUR OUTRAGE, the labour leader, FOOT, grips his paper, mid speech- \nFOOT Can the Right Honourable Lady deny, that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934- \nMARGARET bides her time on the front bench, waiting her turn, surrounded by her CABINET MINISTERS including HOWE, PYM and HESELTINE- \nFOOT (CONT'D) The biggest fall in total output in steel and coal production in one year since 1931. And the biggest collapse in industrial production since 1921. \nMARGARET remains seemingly calm and serene, and yet one hand quietly grips the bench, her wedding ring tapping against the wood nervously. \nFOOT (CONT'D) Can she also accept that her free market economics designed to create a growing middle class ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant! \nINT. CAR. STREETS. LONDON. 1980. DAY \nA rising roar of voices - \nMARGARET is furious. \nMARGARET Don't try to hide you opinions. Goodness me, I'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them - instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. Well? \nMOMENTARILY SILENT- \nMARGARET's eyes travel around the room in waiting- \nPYM Well, people can't pay their mortgages. \nGILMOUR The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees. \nPYM Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes. It's terribly shameful. \nGILMOUR The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace - \nHESELTINE - if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election- \nPYM Quite right. \nMARGARET Ah. Worried about our careers, are we? \nThey make noises - to the effect that nothing could be further from the truth. \nBut MARGARET has their measure. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Gentlemen, if we don't cut spending we will be bankrupt. Yes the medicine is harsh but the patient requires it in order to live. Shall we withhold the medicine? No! We are not wrong. We did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation. (MORE) \nMARGARET (CONT'D) The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy and we will do just that! Barring a failure of nerve. \nThe SNAP OF COTTON - \nMARGARET looks at them in a cold fury... \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Anything else? \nSILENCE- \nMARGARET nods to the seamstress, dismissing her- \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Thank you. You saved the day once again, Crawfie, you're an angel. \nMARGARET straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away. \nHOWE You can't close down a discussion because it's not what you wish to hear. \nMARGARET I don't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. But what kind of leader am I if I don't try to get my own way - to do what I know to be right. \nHOWE Yes. But Margaret, one must be careful of testing one's colleagues' loyalty too far. \nMARGARET glances up watching the MINISTERS disappearing, in whispered conversation, like conspirators. \n(ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Rioting in Brixton, burning cars, huge civil unrest - \nTV JOURNALIST (V.O.)

Are you alright? \nDENIS ghostlike, covered in dust, still in his pyjamas, holding up an obliterated pair of shoes. \nDENIS My shoes! \nBeyond, the wall of the bathroom entirely blown away - \nThe CAW of gulls- \nEXT.

Can't wait...Yes... \nMARGARET suddenly relents, a flicker of sudden and urgent need, caught in her eyes- \nMARGARET (CONT'D) (beat) Mark? \nSilence- \nMARK gone.

Now look where it's got you. \nDENIS stands dressed in dinner jacket and bow tie as he reads the back of \"The King and I\" DVD. \nDENIS (CONT'D) Did you know Yul Brynner was a gypsy from Vladivostok? \nADMIRAL LEACH (V.O.)

DAY \nHaig and Margaret sit facing each other, flanked by senior ministers. \nGENERAL HAIG So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They're thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically... insignificant, if you'll excuse me - \nMARGARET Just like Hawaii, I imagine. \nGENERAL HAIG I'm sorry? \nMARGARET 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all. \nGENERAL HAIG But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war.... \nMARGARET With all due respect sir, I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day. \nBEAT \nMARGARET turns to a tea trolley close by- \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Now, shall I be mother? \nHAGUE looks confused, MARGARET lifting the teapot- \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?

We are tracking it with our submarine HMS Conqueror. \nHe points to a model submarine at some distance from the Argentinian boats. \nMARGARET Is this ship a threat? \nADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.

There will be no appeasement. This is a war. A war they started and by God, we will finish. Shall I tell you what I'm going to write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the Falklands. \nINTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) muddy mass graves as the Falklands dead are buried. \nMILITARY VOICE Lieutenant Colonel Jones.

A hand turns off the radio. \nDENIS Thatcher, bed. \nHe heads down the hall, MARGARET following behind. \nRADIO From their new positions, our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley.

That Mrs Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in. \nINT. HOUSE OF COMMONS HALLWAY, 1990. DAY. \nMARGARET moving swiftly down the hall, leaving her cabinet in her wake. \nPYM (O.S.) The point is, Prime Minister, I don't think we can sell the idea of a tax that asks everyone to pay the same. \nMARGARET (V.O.) Our policies may be unpopular, but they are the right policies. \nMINISTER 1 (V.O.) Prime Minister I just don't think we can ask the poorest of the poor to pay the same amount of tax as a multi-millionaire. \nINT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1990. DAY \nMARGARET, seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by a subdued CABINET. Most of the familiar old faces - PYM, HESELTINE, etc. All now gone. \nHOWE the last enduring minister. \nShe casts a gimlet-eye over the GREY-SUITED MEN around her. \nMARGARET There it is again! Why not? \nMINISTER 1 Because - \nMINISTER 2 Because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair. \nMARGARET Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up, (and who don't feel guilty about it) we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community! \nSILENCE. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) And I see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union, to retain British sovereignty of Britain, the integrity of the pound! Some of you want to make concessions. I hear some of you agree with the latest French proposals. (beat) Well, why don't you get on a boat to Calais? Yes, why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85% of your income to the French government! \nShe has subdued them utterly. The silence is terrible. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Right. What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session, Lord President? (MORE) \nMARGARET (CONT'D) And why have we not made more progress to date? What is that? Is that the timetable? I haven't seen that. May I see it? \nHOWE Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course. \nHOWE pushes the papers over to her. She picks up a pencil, starts to read. \nThe MINISTERS watch as, quickly, she starts to score through the words. \nMARGARET The wording is sloppy here, and here. \nHOWE If you say so. \nMARGARET I do say so. \nHOWE It's merely a first draft... \nMARGARET looks down at the paperwork. \nMARGARET This is ridiculous. There are two \"T's\" in \"committee\"! \nShe presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the offending word. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) This is shameful. Shameful! I can't even rely on you for a simple timetable! Are you unwell? Yes you are unwell. Give me the pencil, give it to me! \nMINISTER 4 (O.S.) She behaved appallingly. I wouldn't have spoken to my gamekeeper like that. \nMINISTER 1 (O.S.) I don't think she can survive this. \nINT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. NIGHT. MARGARET stands, watching the evening news, HESELTINE just visible on the TV screen- HESELTINE ON TV I'm here to announce my decision to put my name forward as leader of the Conservative party. I have nothing but admiration for our Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, but I believe our party and our country need a new leader. MARGARET turns to DENIS, who stands, clearly shocked, worst fears confirmed. \nTV JOURNALIST It's extraordinary. The rules of the Conservative Party make it possible for Conservative MP's to depose a sitting Prime Minister. \nMARGARET and DENIS on the sofa.

From the opposition. The chamber reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy.

And I ask the honourable gentleman, whose fault is that? \nSHADOW MINISTER Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down! \nThe OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats, laughing... falsely of course. \nBut MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her, on the government benches, who are also sniggering in agreement. \nMARGARET If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself! \nHer opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug: smiling, pointing a finger at her. \nSHADOW MINISTER Why has this Conservative government failed?

You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we've already got her vote. You've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it more- \nAIREY NEAVE Important. \nREECE Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority. \nAIREY NEAVE Methinks the Lady doth screech too much \nREECE People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes.

MARGARET stares at him. \nMARGARET It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of them. Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable. REECE If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be. \nNEAVE You've got it in you to go the whole distance. \nREECE Absolutely. \nMARGARET Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party. NEAVE moves in intently- NEAVE Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself. MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical. \nREECE Leave us to do the rest. A BEAT MARGARET Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable. MARGARET smiles at them. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM. NATIONAL THEATRE. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET stands humming, a THEATRICAL COACH presses her hand to MARGARET'S stomach. THEATRICAL VOICE COACH And...bring it down. MARGARET hums lower, tries to project her voice. \nMARGARET Maaaaaaaaaaaa. \nTHEATRICAL VOICE COACH Good, I think we can loose the handbag, Mrs Thatcher...Hands down the sides...Because this isn't really about the voice, it's about belief...A nice deep breath. REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the performance. DENIS, though present, is having a crafty fag by the window. \nTHEATRICAL VOICE COACH (CONT'D) If you're calling Mr Thatcher, how would you do that? MARGARET looks over at him. MARGARET (calls) Denis. He doesn't react. \nTHEATRICAL VOICE COACH Yes, I want more authority, I want conviction, I want - \nMARGARET (a little more authority) Denis. \nTHEATRICAL VOICE COACH That's right, one more time, deep breath - She puts on her new, lower voice. MARGARET Denis. And DENIS reacts immediately, like a guilty thing surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly towards her. DENIS Yes MT! \nEXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY. \nMARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a white cap on her head. \nMARGARET You are the backbone of our nation! Small firms like Loveday's Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to meet you ladies. \n", "test3_true": "MARGARET (CONT'D) I'll just have a small one, because I'm watching my figure. (handing the cone out) That's for you young man! \nINT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET is having new hair colour and the colourist is 75 percent through putting her hair in foil. \nMARGARET (V.O.) I passionately believe it's the growth of small businesses into larger ones that is critical for Britain's future. \nREECE and NEAVE are sitting nearby, both of them reading the Financial Times. \nEXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY. MARGARET among the ladies again. \nMARGARET It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis. \nLaughter. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) (returning to her subject) That's the only way we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that sustain. \nINT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET sitting under the dryer, cooking her new hair, still correcting paperwork while REECE and NEAVE look on, twiddling their thumbs. \nEXT. FACTORY. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET is standing on an impromptu stage outside a factory. She has a hard hat on her head. MARGARET The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them. It stops them from working. It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees. I say enough. It's time to get up. It's time to go to work. It's time to put the Great back into Great Britain! \nINT. HAIR SALON. 1975. DAY The bouffant is now apparent. REECE AND NEAVE watch in awe. \nINT. BACKSTAGE. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY A darkened backstage. MARGARET, clutching her speech, goes over her lines. A FEMALE AIDE sprays her hair. \nShe looks up, starts to move towards the light. \nAIREY NEAVE is suddenly next to her. NEAVE Give `em hell! He looks her up and down, with a smile. NEAVE (CONT'D) You look magnificent. Next stop Prime Minister. \nMARGARET Oh Airey... \nAs from the stage - \nANNOUNCER The leader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher! MARGARET pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle to the sound of GROWING APPLAUSE. \nINT. MAIN HALL. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY BRITAIN NEEDS THE CONSERVATIVES bannered overhead and hung with Union Jacks. MARGARET a swathe of blue, as she passes through her GREY SUITED CABINET. From behind she stands, arms outstretched, accepting the applause, a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands before a sea of CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES holding up letter cards WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE! \nWedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a kind of rapture. The blessed Margaret ! DENIS just visible with REECE, HOWE, PYM, HESELTINE and several other GREY SUITED MINISTERS of her cabinet, seated close behind now jumping to their feet, with obvious relief and delight - RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE, FLASH BULBS POPPING MARGARET smiles, glorious, catching DENIS' eye. He is brimming with pride. AIREY NEAVE beams at his protegee. \nINT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. Close on a photograph of MARGARET and AIREY NEAVE. MARGARET sits looking at it, her coat on, her handbag on her lap. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1979. EVE. \nMARGARET is loading papers and files into the boot of her car. AIREY NEAVE drives towards her, winding down his window. \nNEAVE Good night Margaret. My money's on the filly to win! \nMARGARET Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight. \nHe laughs and drives towards the exit of the car park. \nAs MARGARET closes the boot and opens the door to get in the car suddenly there's a MASSIVE EXPLOSION, the sound magnified by being in the cavernous underground. \nFor a few seconds we don't know what's happened. \nThrough the smoke we see MARGARET running up the ramp towards us. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) No. No, no! Airey! \nHer POV of the fireball of Neave's car. As Margaret looks in horror at the scene. Her shattered face. \n"}

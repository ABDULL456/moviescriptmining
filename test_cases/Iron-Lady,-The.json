Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating, no lighting in their classrooms. And I ask the honourable gentleman, whose fault is that? \nSHADOW MINISTER Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down! \nThe OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats, laughing... falsely of course. \nBut MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her, on the government benches, who are also sniggering in agreement. \nMARGARET If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself! \nHer opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug: smiling, pointing a finger at her. \nSHADOW MINISTER Why has this Conservative government failed?

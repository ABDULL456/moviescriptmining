AUDREY Ever since we joined the country club. 
89   INT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                                 89 
Revolver fires upwards. Swimmers dive. It's a swimming competition. Conrad is sitting on one of the top bleachers, fully dressed, uneasy, while down there, by the side of the pool, his friends, in swimming trunks and wet hair, watch the race. Lazenby sees him, Conrad looks down. In the audience, everyone is shouting for his team. 
Now the competition is finished. The swimming pool is empty and silent, except for someone sweeping the side of the pool, and Conrad sitting still, reflecting, looking around. 
90   EXT. SWIMMING POOL EXIT - NIGHT                            90 
The group comes out of the pool. Conrad at the back, as if he wasn't part of it.

LAZENBY I am glad you can laugh about it, cos' it sure as hell wasn't funny. Come on, we weren't that bad. 
STILLMAN Let's face it, we stunk. I don't know how you can listen to that lecture on Buck Jarrett one more time. I know he is the world's greatest swimmer, but it bugs the hell outa me when he does that. 
LAZENBY Stillman, cut it. 
STILLMAN Think he's ever gonna stop kissing the guy's picture? 
LAZENBY Stillman, shut the hell up, would you? Hey, con, you want a ride? 
CONRAD Oh. No. Thanks. 
LAZENBY We sure could've used you today, buddy. 
CONRAD Oh, no, I don't think so. 
LAZENBY Yeah... I don't think anybody could've helped us today. 
STILLMAN How's it going, Jarrett? I hear you got eyes for Pratt these days. You in her pants yet? 
CONRAD Hey, do me a favor, Stillman, try not to be such a prick. 
STILLMAN You're the prick. Guys like you walk around like you're king shit. You give me a goddamn pain in the ass, you think we owe you... 
(CONTINUED) 
90   CONTINUED:                                                 90 
Conrad hits him hard with a jab, then jumps on him. They fall in the plastic bags of the disposal, Conrad still hitting. Lazenby tries to stop him. Conrad pushes him away. Two students take hold of Conrad and pull him away, two others with Stillman. 
LAZENBY Come on! Connie. Come on! Cool it, Jarrett! Connie! Connie. That's enough. 
STUDENTS No, Stillman, no! No! 
STILLMAN Let go! Let go! 
LAZENBY It's all right! He's crazy!   Just calm down, uh? 
STILLMAN You're crazy! You're crazy! You know that? 
Conrad walks back to his car 
STILLMAN (cont'd) Send him back where he came from! 
OTHERS Now, now, it's over. It's over. 
STILLMAN All right!     Shit! 
Stillman hits a garbage bag. 
91   INT. CAR 足 NIGHT                                           91 
Conrad opens the door and sits down in his car. Lazenby comes, opens the door and hands Conrad his hat. 
LAZENBY Here's your hat. 
Lazenby comes in and sits. 
LAZENBY (cont'd) You want to talk? The guy's a nothing.   He's a zero upstairs. You used to know that about him, Con. Ever since fourth grade, you've known it. 
(CONTINUED) 
91   CONTINUED:                                                      91 
CONRAD So? 
LAZENBY So you just make yourself look stupid when you let him get to you like that! 
CONRAD So I look stupid, is that it? 
LAZENBY No, it isn't. What is it with you? Huh? I don't know why you want to be in this alone? You know, I miss him too. Connie, the three of us were best friends! 
CONRAD I can't help it, it hurts too much to be around you. I gotta go. 
Lazenby looks at him, then opens the door and goes out. 
LAZENBY Yeah. Okay. 
Conrad remains alone and touches the horn by accident. 
92   INT. GRANDPARENTS' HOME, STAIRS & LANDING 足 NIGHT               92 
Conrad gets home, climbs upstairs directly to his room, and closes the door. His grandmother hears him, opens her bedroom door, closes it.

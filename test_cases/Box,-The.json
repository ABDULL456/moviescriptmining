{"train": "THE BOX \nWritten by \nRichard Kelly \nBased on the short story \n\"BUTTON, BUTTON\" \nBy \nRichard Matheson \nSep 30th, 2006 \nOVER A BLACI: SCREEN: Crickets chirp in the night. A DOORBELL rings. Sheets rustle... A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nNORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies next to her. \nNORMA Did you hear something? \nARTHUR The doorbell. \nNORMA Are you sure that was the doorbell? From down below... the DOORBELL rings again. \nARTHUR Yep. Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What time is it? \nNORMA Quarter 'til five. Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe. Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT \nNorma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door. She looks through the PEEPHOLE. Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in the street. It quickly drives off. Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices something at her feet. \nSomeone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1' She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no markings on it whatsoever. Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes the door and turns inside and away from the cold air. Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs. \nARTHUR What is it? \nNORMA Someone left a box. \nARTHUR Who? \nNORMA I don't know. There was a car waiting... but they drove off. Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Is that one of my Christmas presents? Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas. His parents just stare back at him in silence. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table. Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on eagerly. \nWALTER Should I close my eyes? \nARTHUR Maybe... it's up to you. Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its dimensions are 8\" x 8\" x 8\". \nThe box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON. \nNORMA Is there a note? Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name: \nMRS. LEWIS \nARTHUR It's for you, Norma. Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white stationary. Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence: \nMR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM. \nNORMA Dana... you're baby-sitting for us tonight, right? \nDANA Eight o'clock? \nNORMA Eight o'clock. \nDANA Okay. Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved head. \nNORMA Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas... \nBUD Our last day! \nNORMAL I know! \nBUD It'll all be over soon, Norma. He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then shuts the doors to the bus. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper. The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the panels of the comic strip REX MORGAN, MD. Arthur begins reading the voices of REX MORGAN and his girlfriend JUNE. \nARTHUR (as Rex Morgan) Do you realize that this is the first time in my life that I will be taking more than a week's vacation, June? Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp. \nARTHUR (CONT-D) (as June, hi-pitched) And enjoy it! Don't worry about the office! \nNORMA Rex Morgan... I need you back here no later than seven. Rehearsal dinner starts at eight. Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL. \nARTHUR The Viking Squad has a game at four. \nNORMA Don't get stuck in Friday traffic... \nARTHUR Okay June. He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor. She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him. \nNORMA Not in the house! \nARTHUR How's your foot? \nNORMA It's fine. She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the door that leads out to the garage. They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the kitchen table... moving in toward the box. \nEXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe GARAGE DOOR opens and both of the LEWIS FAMILY CARS back out at the same time, almost choreographed in perfect unison. Arthur drives a SILVER 1975 PONTIAC TRANS-AM. Norma drives a WHITE 1976 OLDSMOBILE STATION WAGON with WOOD WALLS. They pull out onto MONUMENT AVENUE, cars pointing in opposite directions. Arthur rolls down his window. \nARTHUR It's your Christmas present. \nNORMA From you? \nB. \nARTHUR From your secret lover. \n(BEAT) Mr. Steward. She furrows her brow. \nNORMA \n(SARCASTIC) I hate you, Rex Morgan MD. \nARTHUR \n(PLAYFUL) I hate you, too. \nNORMA Don't be late tonight. \nARTHUR I've got your present at work. It's almost finished. He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave. From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in the mirror's reflection. INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate. The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite direction. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN RICHMOND -- MORNING \nHELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA crests over the barren WINTER FOREST on the southeast side of the city... tipping up to reveal DOWNTOWN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. \nMALE STUDENT #1 Yes! Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT ( 12). She looks at the owl pellet in disgust. \nFEMALE STUDENT #1 This is so gross. Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles. \nCHARLES Why do they call it an owl pellet? A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma. \nMALE STUDENT #2 Because they shit out of their mouths. \nNORMA Hey... watch the language. You say another cuss word I've gotta send you to detention, okay? \nMALE STUDENT #2 Sorry, Mrs. Lewis. \nFEMALE STUDENT #1 Is it true? \nNORMA Is what true? \nFEMALE STUDENT #1 That owls poo out of their mouths. \nNORMA Yes... this is true. The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh. \nNORMA (CONT-D) Grey forest owls feed upon field mice, squirrels and small birds. The owl will then regurgitate the bones and waste matter in a ball of black mucous. Inside this mucous you will likely find the entire skeleton of its prey. Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN. \nNORMA (CONT-D) I'm going to show you a film about the digestive process of the owl, and how the owl pellet is formed. The classroom whispers with excitement. \nEXT. NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER -- ENTRANCE GATE -- MORNING \nArthur pulls through the ENTRANCE GATE at the NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER. He retrieves his BADGE from the dashboard and shows it to the guard. \nEXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur's car drives down MAIN STREET on the campus of the research center. The buildings are predominately drab, functional, one story brick structures.. surrounded by various GLOBE STRUCTURES and PIPE NETWORKS on manicured green lawns. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded corridor of one of the research buildings. He says hello to various colleagues along the way. All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place resembles an all-male community college for young scientists. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway. NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a \nLARGE SCREEN. \nREPORTER #1 It's been five months since the Viking lander touched down on the surface of Mars. We've seen dozens of photographs of the rock covered surface... what can you now tell us about the tests you've been conducting? Is there any sign of life on the red planet? Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium. \nCAHILL Well... there are three separate tests that we've been conducting... Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release and Gas Exchange. The first two tests, based on soil samples about 22 centimeters deep, came back negative... and the third is... still pending. Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the auditorium. \nREPORTER #1 Can you elaborate on test number three? Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX \nPENCIL. \nCAHILL The gas exchange experiment measures the production or uptake of C02, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen during the incubation of the martian soil sample. \nREPORTER #2 Are you showing us all of the photos? Are there little green men up there? Laughter from the press. \nCAHILL Well... there is a possibility that the planet abounds with chemical compounds produced by living systems. Their chemical nature, distribution and structural uniqueness could be used to argue the presence of microscopic living organisms on Mars. As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the reporter on the shoulder. \nARTHUR It all comes down to water. Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity of the site where VIKING II landed. There are dry river-bed formations in the soil. \nARTHUR (CONT-D) If we find water beneath the surface... and the topographic maps of Utopia Planitia indicate that there were once rivers on the surface of the planet, it's possible that we'll eventually find evidence of life. \nINT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of the class next to the projector. She crosses her legs... reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes... clearly in intense pain. Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye contact... and Charles turns back to the screen. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNING \nArthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory. \nArthur discards... then retrieves a replacement card from the stack. \nARTHUR So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor takes the x-ray... then he goes to check on another patient down the hall. Arthur discards a king. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray machine on. \nWENDELL Jesus. That's not good. \nINT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT \nNorma raises up her right shoe to show the class. \nNORMA They found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completely \nI destroyed by the radiation. Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot against her left inner thigh. \nNORMA (CONT'D) So they have to amputate four of my toes. And then they had to take a bunch of skin from my inner thigh to cover the front of my foot. This is back in 1963... so they didn't have the skin graft techniques they do now. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT \nArthur stands up and takes his RIGHT FOOT... pulls it up and touches it to his LEFT INNER THIGH. \nARTHUR She had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months, waiting for it to heal. Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table. \nWENDELL Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot. \nARTHUR Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won. \nWENDELL What was the settlement? \nARTHUR Forty thousand dollars. Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the new \nPROSTHESIS. \nINT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT \nNorma turns around and uncrosses her legs. They now dangle over the edge of the lab desk. \nNORMA You guys want to see it? Now that the secret is out... I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot. The class responds enthusiastically. \nNORMA (CONT'D) Come on... gather round... take a look at the freak show. As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and reveals her disfigured foot... missing every toe but her pinky. A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT \nArthur takes the trimmed PROSTHESIS and wraps it in tissue paper, then places it in a CARDBOARD BOX with a red bow on it. \nARTHUR If this sucker works... she can, start jogging again. \nINT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MIDDAY \nDana walks up to Walter as he stands in front of his locker. \nDANA I'm sorry I said that her foot looked gross. \nWALTER It doesn't look gross... it looks cool. And if you can't tell the difference between gross and cool... then I feel sorry for you, Dana. Walter walks off... leaving her alone. \nEXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- AFTERNOON \nNorma emerges from her car carrying GROCERY BAGS in both arms. Walter comes out of the garage with his bike. \nNORMA Hey honey. \nWALTER Why do I need a baby-sitter? \nNORMA Because you're nine years old. You're not a geezer yet. \nWALTER It's 1976, mom. Times are changing. Nine years old isn't what it used to be. I think I'm ready to get a moped. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) Then, you will receive a payment of two-hundred thousand dollars... tax free. Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) The money will be delivered to you in cash. Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much money. \nNORMA Are you for real? Arlington smiles back at her. \nARLINGTON Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that the offer is real. \nNORMA Who do you work for? \nARLINGTON The guarantee of payment has several restrictions. One... I am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers. \n(BEAT) Two... if you discuss the details of this financial opportunity with anyone other than your husband, the offer is null and void, and you will not receive the money in return for having pushed the button. \n(BEAT) Three... you have twenty four hours. Arlington glances at his watch. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) You have until five o'clock tomorrow evening to make your decision whether or not to push the button. At that time, I will return to retrieve the button unit from you. It will be re-programmed and the offer will be made to someone else. Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it with crisp precision, and hands it over to her. He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) Until then... a good day to you, Mrs. Lewis. He nods his head and turns toward the foyer. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT \nShe follows him toward the front door. \nNORMA Wait a minute... you're just going to leave me with this thing. \n(BAFFLED) Is this some kind of joke? Who are you? He opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly smile. \nARLINGTON My name is Arlington Steward, and I can assure you that this is no joke. The offer is real, but I am not at liberty to disclose any more information than I already have. He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) Good day. He heads down the walk toward his car. She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed in an embossed BLACK FONT: \nARLINGTON STEWARD \nShe turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE NUMBER printed on the back: \nShe stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the automobile, start the engine and drive off. \nEXT. CARYTOWN SHOPPING CENTER -- AFTERNOON \nWalter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in CARYTOWN. Dana approaches him. He turns to face her. \nWALTER What do you want? \nDANA I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you... that I think your mom is beautiful. Walter just stares at her in silence... wanting to forgive her. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nNorma walks back into the kitchen, holding the key envelope in one hand and the business card in the other. She stares at them both, then down at the box. She then retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the slot, opening the glass dome. She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the dome. She closes her eyes... trying to make sense of what has just transpired. \nINT. BURNS HOUSE -- NEXT \nThe CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING PHONE that sits on a KITCHEN COUNTER in a large suburban house. SUSAN BURNS (50s) goes to answer the phone. \nSUSAN Hello? \nNORMA (PHONE) Hey mom. \nSUSAN Hey honey. What's up? \nNORMA (PHONE) Nothing... I just... The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM BURNS (50s) laid out in a recliner, watching television. \nSUSAN Is something wrong? \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nNorma stares at the business card. \nARTHUR Yeah... what's it all about. Did he show up? \nNORMA Yeah... I'll tell you about it in the car. We're running late. Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek. \nNORMA (CONT'D) We'll be home late... your bedtime is ten. Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in Norma's hands. \nEXT. RIVER ROAD -- NIGHT \nThe CAMERA tracks with Arthur's car as it drives south on CARY STREET... approaching an intersection. \nINT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT \nNorma has the box sitting in her lap while Arthur drives. \nNORMA And before I could ask him anything else... he got in his car... and he pulled off. \nARTHUR Did you get the license plate? \nNORMA No. \nARTHUR Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number. \nNORMA I was little overwhelmed, Arthur. \nARTHUR Somewhere in the world... someone you do not know will die. \nNORMA Those were his exact words. \nARTHUR Did he say how they would die? \nNORMA No. \nARTHUR And he showed you the cash. \nNORMA Yeah. He said it was two-hundred thousand. It looked real to me. \nARTHUR What did he look like? \nNORMA You don't want to know. I think he's a burn victim. Poor thing... half of his face is gone. \nARTHUR Really? \nNORMA I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us. \nEXT. COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA -- NIGHT \nThe CAMERA descends upon the COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA. It is a MASSIVE COLONIAL MANSION that sits upon a huge hill that is littered with CHRISTMAS LUMINARIES that glow in the night. \nEXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT \nWe approach Arthur's car as they pull into a PARKING SPACE in front of the main entrance. \nINT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT \nArthur grabs the box from off her lap. \nARTHUR Did you bring the key with you? She hands it to him. He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome. He then takes his INDEX FINGER and places it on the button. \nNORMA What the hell are you doing?! \nARTHUR \n(PLAYFUL) I was gonna push the button. \nNORMA No! \nNorma reaches over and snaps the dome closed. \nSUSAN They're all wearing them that way now, Bev. \nNATHAN BURNS ( 26), Norma's wheelchair-bound younger brother, comes rolling up. \nNATHAN Outer space? Is someone planning on departing the surface of the earth? \nARTHUR Nathan! Arthur stands up and gives him a hug. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) It's been years. How have you been? \nNATHAN I've been better... I mean, I used to have legs... The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might start to cry. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Sorry... morbid humor. What's this talk about outer space? \nNORMA Arthur has been working at Nasa. \nJIM He helped design the camera that photographed the Mars surface. Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair. \nARTHUR Nathan and I are gonna go grab a drink... He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar. \nNORMA Arthur made me a new prosthesis for my foot. Some space age formula... it's incredible. \nJIM Can he make Nathan a pair of prosthetic legs? \nINT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- BAR -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur now sits with Nathan over by the bar. \nNATHAN Can you believe it? I survive eighteen months crawlling through the Vietnam jungle and not one bullet so much as grazes my body. \n(BEAT) And I come home, take a few tabs of LSD at a Grateful Dead show and wrap my car around a tree. Arthur doesn't know how to respond. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Pretty damn sad... losing the legs that way, but I always thought it was Karmic retribution for what I did to Norma. \nARTHUR What'd you ever do to Norma? \nNATHAN I dropped that barbell on her foot when we were kids. That's why she went to get that x-ray. If it wasn't for me... she'd still have all her toes. \nARTHUR You can't think of it that way. \nNATHAN Why not? It's the truth. \nARTHUR You didn't leave the x-ray machine on, Dr. Stupid did. \nNATHAN Yeah, but my mistake sent her to Dr. Stupid... so that makes me culpable in the eyes of Buddha. \nARTHUR You're no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell. Stop punishing yourself. Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack Daniels. \nNATHAN You know he's here. \nARTHUR Who? \nNATHAN Dr. Stupid. Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a practice over on the west end. Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye contact... and Stupe quickly looks away. \nINT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT \nSusan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be. \nSUSAN I wonder if he even recognizes us. \nJIM I'm sure he does. \nDEBORAH I can't believe they still let him practice medicine. \nNORMA You gotta let it go. You gotta learn to forgive and forget. \nARLINGTON Thank you. Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them. Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) Two-hundred thousand. You can count it if you like. Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes. \nARTHUR Thanks... we trust your word. Arlington offers him a broad smile. \nARLINGTON As you should. He then turns to leave. \nEXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- NEXT \nThey follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is unclear who is driving. \nNORMA You said before that the box is re- programmed... \nARLINGTON Yes. \nNORMA So now what? Are you gonna go and make the offer to someone else? \nARLINGTON Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs. Lewis. \n(BEAT) And I can promise you that the offer will be made... to someone you do not know. He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger side. The driver hits the gas and the car speeds off. Arthur moves out into the street... watching the car go... \nARTHUR I got his license plate. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs a PENCIL. He then scrawls the LICENSE PLATE NUMBER down on a piece of scratch paper. \nAXV-4049 \nARTHUR What are you thinking, Norma? \nNORMA I don't know. Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase and starts counting through the money. \nARTHUR Did he mean that we're next? Is that what he meant? \nNORMA I don't know. \nINT. POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT \nJim Burns sits behind his desk at the POLICE STATION. His SECRETARY (20s) comes in to his office. \nSECRETARY Your daughter is on line two. \nJIM Alright. He picks up the phone. \nJIM (CONT'D) Norma... \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nNorma stares at the money in the briefcase. \nNORMA Hey dad... \nJIM (PHONE) What's going on... \nNORMA I need a favor. \nJIM (PHONE) Sure... what do you need? \nNORMA I need you to run a license plate for me. Someone just came by the house... and we think he might... (looking to Arthur) He just seemed real suspicious and Arthur got the license plate and I need you to run it. \nJIM (PHONE) Okay honey... you need me to send someone over? \nNORMA No... if you could just run the plate and find out whose car it is. \n(BEAT) AXV-4049 is the number. \nArthur and Norma drive toward downtown. \nNORMA There was owl... in our back yard. \nARTHUR An owl? \nNORMA He said it was his owl. \nARTHUR Are you hiding anything else from me, Norma? \nNORMA \n(DEFENSIVE) No. \nINT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT \nThe CAMERA tracks with Arthur and Norma as they move through the vast space of the RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY. They arrive at the ADULT FICTION section... and the CAMERA moves along the spines of various books until it arrives at the one with the call number: F2988.34 Norma removes a BOOK from the shelf and looks at the cover: \nNO EXIT \nJEAN-PAUL SARTRE Norma shows it to Arthur. \nNORMA No exit. \nARTHUR \n(MIS-PRONOUNCES) Sartre. \nNORMA it's pronounced Sartre. Jean-Paul Sartre. The French existentialist. She begins to thumb through the pages of the play. \nARTHUR Never read it. \nNORMA It's a play... I read it in high school. It's about three strangers who find themselves trapped in a room together for all of eternity. They've quickly discover that they've all been sent to hell. Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book. Someone has written in crisp penmanship: \nRICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH \nSEPTEMBER 3, 1976 Norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library card. The name of the last person to check out the book is: \nSTEWARD \nINT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- CIRCULATION DESK -- NEXT \nArthur and Norma approach the circulation desk. A female LIBRARIAN ( 70s) is standing there. \nNORMA Hi... we're looking for an archival Times-Dispatch from September of this year. She offers them a warm smile. \nLIBRARIAN Microfiche. \nINT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur and Norma now sit in front of a MICROFICHE READER in a long line of wooden desks in the RECORDS ROOM. On the screen... HEADLINES from the year's newspapers scroll by... stopping on the headline for SEPTEMBER 3, 1976: \nMARS PHOTOS REVEALED \nVIKING LANDER SENDS FIRST IMAGES OF RED PLANET BACK TO EARTH \nARTHUR Arlington Steward... I remember the name now. He used to work at \nNASA... \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- [FLASHBACK] \nArthur and Wendell are standing among a large group of SCIENTISTS in the laboratory. Everyone is assembled... staring at a large BLANK SCREEN, waiting in anticipation. Cahill stands at the front of the group with a WALKIE-TALKIE to his ear. \nCAHILL Alright... the first photo should come down off the server in less than a minute. \nEXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LUNAR LANDER MODULE -- NEXT \nJIM Our fugitive is named Robert Bevilacqua. He shot and killed his wife at their residence on Cary Street earlier today. We believe that he escaped on foot... and could be armed and dangerous. The CAMERA moves across a line of POLICE OFFICERS... listening... \nJIM (CONT'D) Mr. Bevilacqua is an employee at NASA... and he is a former Marine who served in Vietnam. He may very well be armed and dangerous... \nINT. RICHMOND BAR -- NEXT \nThe CAMERA tracks through a dingy RICHMOND DIVE BAR. Bevilacqua sits at the bar with a baseball cap pulled down low to conceal his face. He is drinking whiskey. Wendell James approaches... carrying a FILE under his arm. \nWENDELL Bevilacqua... Bevilacqua turns to face him. \nBEVILACQUA Wendell. They hug one another. \nINT. RICHMOND BAR -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe two men are now sitting across from one another in a BOOTH. Wendell has a NASA BLUE-PRINT laid out on the table. The blue-print is of the button unit. \nBEVILACQUA You designed it? \nWENDELL Yeah. Cahill told me to... \nBevilacaua notices a SMALL PURPLE STAIN on the blue-print. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- [FLASHBACK] \nCahill stands over Wendell's shoulder as he sits at a DRAFTING TABLE in the laboratory. \nWENDELL This what you were looking for, sir? Cahill looks stares at the blue-print... possessed. A DROP OF BLOOD falls from his right nostril and lands on it. \nCAHILL Yes. Thank you Wendell. \nINT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- DAY \nThe CAMERA moves through the MASSIVE MAIN HANGAR at Langley. There are several planes parked inside. Wendell emerges from behind one of the planes... watching from a hidden vantage point... Cahill stands at a work table with Arlington. There are THREE BUTTON UNITS laid out on the table. Arlington begins to place them inside a leather bag. Cahill then hands Arlington a FILE. \nCAHILL You're not gonna hurt these boys, are you? \nARLINGTON Any harm that comes to them will be their own doing. Arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance. \nEXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- NEXT \nOutside... there is a MASSIVE CEMENT RUNWAY. Parked on the runway is Arlington's car. BUD WALL steps out and opens the door for his boss. Bus-Driver Bud is Steward's driver... Arlington steps inside. Wendell watches them drive off... \nINT. RICHMOND DIVE BAR -- EVENING \nWendell then hands a file to Bevilacqua. Inside there is a dossier and photo of a ARTHUR LEWIS. He flips to another dossier and photo of another NASA EMPLOYEE named KENNETH \nWELLER. \nWENDELL There's a list... and they've all got a wife and one child. Bevilacqua thumbs through the list of NASA dossiers. He sees Arthur Lewis among them. \nWENDELL (CONT'D) Did you kill your wife? Bevilacqua just stares at him... on the verge of tears. He slides an ENVELOPE across the table. \nBEVILACQUA This is a confession letter that I wrote... it explains everything that happened with Steward and the box.

The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a perfect three-dimensional box. Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son. Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that they are in, the room with him. The CAMERA moves through the wall into another corridor... BUD WALL... dressed as another VALET, passes by... and the CAMERA moves into another DRAWING ROOM... \nWALTER Dana. She gave it to me. Arthur begins to page through the comic book. \nEXT.

There are now several FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES and other EMERGENCY VEHICLES scattered on either side of the interstate. Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher.

AMBULANCE -- NEXT \nArthur sits up in the back of the ambulance. He has a small scrape on his cheekbone... but otherwise appears unharmed. An EMS TECHNICIAN is in there with him. He hands Arthur an \nICE PACK. \nEMS TECHNICIAN Here... hold this against your forehead. It'll keep your head from swelling. Arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head. \nARTHUR Thanks. \nEMS TECHNICIAN I think it might have been a miracle. The EMS Technician shakes his head in disbelief. \nARTHUR What? \nEMS TECHNICIAN That car accident. I've never seen someone walk away from an accident like that. \n(BEAT) Somebody upstairs is looking out for you, buddy. The door to the ambulance opens. A US ARMY OFFICER appears.

Its SEARCHLIGHT sweeps through the forest. In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods, all pointed toward the front window of the diner. Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several other MILITARY PERSONNEL. Arthur notices Norma as she emerges from a BLACK SEDAN... she looks exhausted... delirious. \nNORMA Arthur! \nARTHUR Norma!

Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill toward the diner entrance. \nRESTON (CONT'D) Are you familiar with the myth of Prometheus? \nARTHUR Yeah. \nRESTON In the 1940s... when NASA was formed, we began developing, in secret, a project that we dubbed the Prometheus Effect. \nTEAGUE Projecting fictional scenarios about how we would respond, if and when we came into contact with an alien intelligence. \nRESTON If the intelligence had hostile intent... or if it began to somehow display proof of its ability to destroy us, we would have a system in place to begin negotiating with it in secret. \nEXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT \nUNDERWATER... Walter floats with his arms spread wide... WHITE STROBES OF LIGHT FLICKER AROUND HIM.

Both Arthur and Norma recoil in horror. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON He is now blind and deaf. \n(BEAT) For the rest of his life, he will never hear your voice... or see your face. \nARTHUR (under his breath) Why... \nRESTON/ARLINGTON You are now presented with two options. \n(BEAT) Option one... you enjoy the rest of your lives with the money you have been given, and you learn to live with your son's disability. Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL. He places it on the table next to the box. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) And then there is option number two. \n(BEAT) There is one bullet in the chamber of this gun. Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) You can fire this bullet into your wife's heart... killing her. \n(BEAT) At the exact moment that her spirit departs the earth, this curse upon your son will be reversed, and both of his impaired senses will instantaneously return to normal. \nArthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the twins. He cannot fathom how it has now come to this. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Arthur, you will then be arrested and charged with the murder of your wife... and the money will be placed in an interest bearing trust for your son to receive upon his eighteenth birthday. \nNORMA That's not fair. \n(BEAT) Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid button. If I deserve to be punished for it... then let me kill myself. Arthur has nothing to do with this. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON I'm sorry, but the offer is not negotiable. \n(TO ARTHUR) And if Norma's fingers so much as touch the weapon at any point from this moment on... the restoration of Walter's sight and sound will be denied. \nNORMA If Arthur has to do it... then I want you to make it look like a suicide. Arthur shouldn't be punished for something that I did. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON I'm sorry... but the terms of the offer are not negotiable. Arthur faces has gone completely white. \nARTHUR Is there an afterlife? The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Because this is purgatory, right? The earth is purgatory... and you're here to start shutting things down... right? The twins appear impressed with his foresight. \nRESTON/ARLINGTON I find your theory to be quite fascinating. But I must remind you that I am unable to disclose the identity of my employers. Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras. \nARTHUR Right. I get it. Reston then turns to the window... \nRESTON/ARLINGTON Can someone please bring up the car? \nEXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATER \nArthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps out of the car and holds the door open. Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap hundreds of photographs of the couple. Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for words. Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur. Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps toward the car with Norma at his side. \nINT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT \nNorma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride shotgun. He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is afraid he might pass out. \nARTHUR Tell me this isn't happening, Norma. \nNORMA This isn't happening... She starts the engine... and they drive off. Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at them in the side-view mirror. \nEXT.

I'm so sorry that I did this to us... \nARTHUR I'm the one who told you to push the button... so don't apologize. He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely for the last time. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) I love you too... and please know... that I regret nothing in this life we've lived together. \nNORMA I'll be waiting... counting the days until my Arthur comes to see me. \nINT.

LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nFROM UPSTAIRS... thump... thump... their son's head banging against the door... \nNORMA It's going to be harder for you to live than for me to die. Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is no time to wait any longer. \nARTHUR Well then. \n(BEAT) Let's get on with it. Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her heart. Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum floor. \nINT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT \nSuzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged giggle. He smiles back. \nINT.

It's not a weapon. It's not a gun. We wouldn't be culpable... not in a court of law. \nARTHUR What if it's someone's baby? \nNORMA What if it's some murderer on death row in China? \nARTHUR What if it's our neighbor across the street. Do you know our neighbors across the street? Have you ever met them? \nNORMA Yeah. Doug and Donna. \nARTHUR Hmmm.

Norma stands up and moves toward the foyer. \nNORMA Can you turn off the Christmas tree lights? \nARTHUR I like leaving them on. \nNORMA It's a fire hazard. \nARTHUR It keeps the Christmas spirit alive while we sleep. \nNORMA We could die. \nARTHUR Everyone dies eventually, Norma.

She stares at the box... then at her husband, as he sits down across from her. \nARTHUR What do you want to do Norma? \nNORMA We're gonna have to pull Walter out of that school. \nARTHUR Then push it. \n(TAUNTING) Push the button, Norma... push the button. I dare you. I double-dog diddly dare you. \nNORMA I'm scared to. \nARTHUR Well... if you don't push it... then I will. \n(BEAT) This is stupid. Arthur reaches out to push the button... but she grabs his wrist with her left hand, restraining him. \nNORMA Ladies first. She then reaches out and presses down on the button with her index finger. \nINT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT \nThe CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE STATION in downtown Richmond. A FEMALE OPERATOR sits at each cubicle... \nOPERATOR #1 911 emergency... how may I direct your call? The CAMERA moves in closer... \nOPERATOR #1 (CONT'D) Excuse me? You need to slow down... I can't understand what you're saying. She listens to the voice on the other end of the line. \n", "test2_true": "(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nOPERATOR #1 (CONT'D) What is your address? \n(BEAT) 1500 Cary Street. \nEXT. 1500 CARY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER \nTwo POLICE CARS pull up with their SIRENS blaring in front of a TOWNHOUSE on Cary Street. TWO POLICE OFFICERS emerge from each car and approach the front of the townhouse. They begin to bang loudly on the door. A FEMALE NEIGHBOR (20s) emerges from the townhouse next door. \nNEIGHBOR \n(DISTRAUGHT) I heard a gunshot... then he ran out the front door and got in his car. The POLICE OFFICER looks at his partner and then proceeds to KICK DOWN the door. \nINT. 1500 CARY STREET -- FOYER -- NEXT \nThe OFFICERS move through the townhouse with their GUNS drawn. The SCREAMING of a YOUNG GIRL can be heard from upstairs. \nINT. 1500 CARY STREET -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nThe OFFICERS enter the kitchen. A WOMAN (20s) named AMY BEVILACQUA is slumped over on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood. The CAMERA moves in toward her face. \nINT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT \nAn OFFICER approaches the BATHROOM DOOR at the end of the hall. The screaming girl from inside is bawling her eyes out. The Officer sees a tiny HAND emerge from underneath the door. She is reaching out for help. He goes to open the door, but there is a LARGE DEAD BOLT LOCK mounted on the outside. \nOFFICER #1 Honey... I need you to back away from the door... I'M GONNA HAVE TO \nKICK IT DOWN? The screaming begins to subside. \nOFFICER #1 (CONT'D) \nBACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR! \nFEMALE VOICE okay... The Officer then kicks the door down. \nINT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT \nInside the bathroom... a YOUNG GIRL (7) is cowering in the bathtub... hyperventilating... \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT \nNorma and Arthur are sitting across from one another in silence. There is an empty BOTTLE OF WINE on the table. \nARTHUR There's no turning back now. Seconds later... THE DOORBELL RINGS. Both Norma and Arthur jump in their seats. \nINT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT \nNorma and Arthur move toward the front door. Norma puts her eye to the PEEPHOLE. Arlington's disfigured face stares back at her. She opens the door. Arlington stands there smiling... briefcase in hand. \nARLINGTON Hello, Mrs. Lewis. \nNORMA Hi. \nARLINGTON Do you have the button unit? \nNORMA Uhh... yeah... it's in the kitchen. Norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box, leaving Arthur alone with Arlington. \nARLINGTON And you must be Mr. Lewis. \nArthur stares at him... transfixed. Does he recognize him from somewhere? Norma returns with the box and hands it over to him. \nARLINGTON (CONT'D) And the key? \nNORMA Oh... sorry... Norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small envelope and places it in his hand. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- NIGHT \nThe WEDDING PARTY comes pouring out of the church. There is a massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS & CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows. The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the square. ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN standing close by. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- LATER ON \nThe CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE... which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square. Wedding guests are arriving in droves. The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out for public events... and in this case... for the lavish WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON \nArthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS. Arthur carries the copy of No Exit with him. \nARTHUR The play tells the story of uhree people, condemned to hell. They are to remain in a second empire drawing room for all of eternity. He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just read. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) They soon discover that their eyelids are missing... and for all eternity they will be unable to sleep. Norma remembers most of the play from high school. \nNORMA There are no mirrors... so they will never be able to see their own reflection... but only the faces of their tormentors. \nARTHUR This is Sartre's vision of hell. \nNORMA Because Hell... is other people. The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass. Jim crosses the lawn to greet them. \nJIM Arthur... can I speak with you privately for a moment? \nARTHUR Sure. Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that overlooks the whole party. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- UPPER PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER \nJim and Arthur stand at a table. Jim has several PHOTOGRAPHS laid out on the table. They are mostly family photos taken from the house of Robert Bevilacqua. \nJIM And do you know this fella? Robert Bevilacqua? \nARTHUR Yeah... I know him. He works at \nNASA. \nJIM Do you know his wife? \nARTHUR No... \nJIM Well... he shot and killed his wife yesterday morning. \nARTHUR No... \nJIM Yeah... He shot her point blank in the chest in his kitchen. Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well. \nJIM (CONT'D) This Bevilacqua fella... if he tries to contact you or Norma... you have to call me immediately, you understand? \nARTHUR Yeah. Of course. Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON \nNorma is now standing up on stage with a MICROPHONE in her hand..,. giving her MAID OF HONOR speech. \nNORMA My little sister once asked me... what's the best thing about being married? Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is seated, next to Walter and their parents. \nNORMA (CONT'D) I told her that... it's knowing that for the rest of your life you'll never feel alone. \n(BEAT) Not ever again. She smiles at her husband. \nNORMA (CONT'D) That is... until you get divorced. There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning her head on her new husband's shoulder. \nNORMA (CONT'D) Or... until he decides to kill you. More laughter. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER \nArthur and Norma are now slow dancing. \n", "test3_true": "NORMA Say what? \nARTHUR In your speech. That joke about me killing you. \nNORMA I don't know... I thought it was funny. Guess I've had too much champagne. \nARTHUR Did your dad tell you about Robert Bevilacqua? \nNORMA No. \nARTHUR He shot his wife yesterday morning. Did you know his wife? \nNORMA No. Norma is still searching for some other explanation. \nNORMA (CONT'D) What if it's all a test for the aspiring astronauts? \nARTHUR What do you mean? \nNORMA A psychological test. They want to see how you'll respond to a moral dilemma... the fate of a human life... determined by the push of a single button. Think of the men on the Apollo thirteen mission... sound familiar? They turn slowly on the dance floor... Arthur closes his eyes... his mind racing... A VOICE breaks through the music... \nVOICE (O.S.) May I cut in? Arthur and Norma turn to see a MAN standing there... It is DR. EARL STUPE. \nSTUPE I would like to dance with your wife. Do you mind? Arthur glares at Dr. Stupe. \nNORMA It's okay Arthur... Arthur looks at him... then back at Norma. His face has gone pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on the dance floor. \nARTHUR \nI.. I. \n(SWALLOWS HARD) Will you please excuse me? Arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial estate. Walter is there... waiting. \nWALTER Dad! What's going on? \nARTHUR I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter... He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and then stumbles up the stairs. ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma is now slow dancing with Dr. Stupe. \nSTUPE I know what they call me. Dr. Stupid. My patients... the ones who will still see me... they find out what I did and they stop calling. \nNORMA I'm sorry for that. I can't control what people say. \nSTUPE I am Dr. Stupid now. Someone wrote it on my windshield with soap once. I figure it must have been a relative... a friend of yours. \n(BEAT) Oh... how they love you, Norma Lewis. And they love your husband... the one who saved you. Did he save your life? Did he rescue you from the oblivion that I manufactured? \nNORMA Yes. You have my forgiveness, Earl. People make mistakes... and if they seek forgiveness... they should be forgiven. \n(BEAT) That's the rule of my lord. \nINT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT \nArthur comes into the MEN'S BATHROOM and rushes into one of the stalls. He falls to his knees... leaning over the toilet. \nEXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER \nON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma notices her brother NATHAN... sitting alone at his table in his wheelchair. He is drunk... lost in his own sadness. He smiles at her... \nSTUPE There is that old cliche... that the lord works in mysterious ways. Well... I have met the lord. I have spoken to him in my dreams. And it brought me back to that day in my office when you arrived with a fractured foot... some thirteen years ago. \n(BEAT) He told me that it was essential... \n(MORE) \nSTUPE (CONT'D) an essential event in the cycle of purgatory and its inevitable conclusion. Norma pulls away from him. Blood drains out of his nose... \nSTUPE (CONT'D) For when the cycle of purgatory concludes... there is nothing left but a barren wasteland of rock and sand... a deafening wind and a cold, dry winter. ABOVE... on the MARBLE RAILING... the OWL is perched on the ledge... watching... ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Stupe retrieves a PISTOL from his pocket... and raises his eyes to meet those of his dance partner. \nSTUPE (CONT'D) I am sorry my dear... Stupe takes the pistol... places it against his temple... and pulls the trigger. BLOOD SPRAYS across the dance floor... some of it on Norma's face. PEOPLE BEGIN TO SCREAM AND THE ENTIRE WEDDING ERUPTS \n"}

Hey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at three to one! Don't let me down, mon. 
ROBBIE (to JAFFA) Hey Jaffa. NO worries. (to ALEX, shocked) People are betting on me? 
ALEX Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before... 
ROBBIE I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know. 
Two concessions girls are walking by them. 
CONCESSIONS GIRLS (together) Hi Robbie! 
ROBBIE How ya doin' (to Alex after they have gone by) See. How come everyone knows me by sight now? 
ALEX Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready? 
Another group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of the snack bars. He waves. 
ROBBIE I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky... 
Just then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY. 
TIFFANY Well, hello Robbie. 
ROBBIE (surprised) You know me?

TIFFANY Of course I know you. It's my father's park, I try get to know everyone. 
ALEX (interrupting, eager) I'm Alex! 
TIFFANY Yes, I'm sure you are. (ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie) It's been a while since I've been to Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it? 
ROBBIE The best teriyaki east of the Pacific. 
TIFFANY Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so much about? 
ROBBIE (stunned) Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon. 
TIFFANY It's a date then.    See you later! 
She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the shoulder. 
ALEX Come on, we gotta get back. 
ROBBIE (still shocked) Yes. Yes we do. 
56        INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK                          56 
AOKEE is wiping the counter alone.    HE turns toward the kitchen... 
AOKEE Alex! We need more large smoothie cups out here! 
AOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then. 
AOKEE (CONT'D) (to ALEX) Look at that. 
WE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an

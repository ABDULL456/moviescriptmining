IN BLACK -- 
We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A timpani bangs an ominous beat. 
FADE IN ON: 
A JUNGLE - NIGHT 
A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest, frightened by every shadow and moving leaf. 
YOUNG JUDY (V.O.) Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust! Thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world. A world where prey were scared of predators. And predators had an uncontrollable biological urge to maim and maul and... 
The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows, attacks the bunny, who screams-- 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT 
The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage production. 
YOUNG JUDY Blood, blood, blood! 
Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And when those run out-- projectile ketchup. 
Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS, 10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW! 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And death. 
The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Back then, the world was divided in two. Vicious predator or Meek prey. 
TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY. The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags them underneath with her. 
YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D) But over time, we evolved, and moved beyond our primitive savage ways. 
A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage. Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white muumuus, too. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Now, predator and prey live in harmony. 
Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities. 
ASTRONAUT SHEEP Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore. 
The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade astronaut costume. 
ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D) Instead I can be an astronaut. 
Catmull plays a slide whistle. 
ACTUARY JAGUAR I don't have to be a lonely hunter any more. 
The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit. 
ACTUARY Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary! 
YOUNG JUDY And I can make the world a better place! I am going to be... 
Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box. Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) A police officer! 
Judy's parents, BONNIE & STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid, GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID. 
GIDEON GREY Bunny cop. That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard. 
YOUNG JUDY It may seem impossible to small minds-- (points at Gideon) I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

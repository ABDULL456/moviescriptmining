When I was lying there in the VA hospital, with a big hole blown through the middle of my life, I started having these dreams of flying. \nWe are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums BUILDING to a PEAK -- \nVOICE (V.O.) Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... CUT TO: \nEXT. CITY - NIGHT \nA SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing -- \nJAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years. \nJake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish advertizing. \nJAKE (V.O.) They can fix a spinal, if you've got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy. \nThe traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous, isolated souls. \nINT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom. Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. -- \nPERKY NEWSCASTER The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a century, is making a comeback. These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are... \nJake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side, pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the other, and so on. \nHis legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A \"Born Loser\" tattoo prominent on his shoulder. \nJAKE (V.O.) I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. \nJake struggles with his pants a long time. CUT TO: \nINT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT \nNot the kind of place you'd bring your mom. \nWe find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets, CLAP and WHOOP. \nJake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer. \nA WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men RUNNING on antelope legs. \nCU JAKE, watching what he can't have.    Expression stony. \nJAKE (V.O.) Let's get it straight up front. I don't want your pity. I know the world's a cold-ass bitch. \nJake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with. Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away. \nCU JAKE -- not looking away. \nJAKE (V.O.) You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak. \nTIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair. \nTRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's just the way things are.   And nobody does a damn thing. \nJake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS. \nThe chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and -- \nJAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor. \nTHE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling... \nJAKE (V.O.) All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for. CUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT \nTHE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash. \nJake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight. \nJAKE I hope you realize you've just lost a customer! \nHe collapses onto his back, panting. \nJAKE (to himself) Candy ass bitch. \nHe stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking -- then shouts jauntily to no one in particular -- \nJAKE If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled amongst the trash, getting drenched. \nTWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him. \nJake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.   He squints up at -- \nTWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors. \nAGENT 1 Are you Jake Sully? \nJAKE Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood. \nAGENT 2 It's about your brother. CUT TO: \nINT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT \nDOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY. \nJAKE (V.O.) The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet. \n", "test1_true": "JAKE Jesus, Tommy. \nJAKE (V.O.) The Suits' concern was touching. \nAGENT 1 Your brother represented a significant investment. We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract. \nThe ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape dispenser, like it's a package for shipping. The cardboard coffin is rolled into the furnace. \nJAKE (V.O.) The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers. \nPUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light. \nJAKE (V.O.) Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin' sent someplace I was gonna regret. \nINSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the cardboard; TOMMY'S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame but not touched by it, as we -- DISSOLVE TO: \nJAKE'S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath. \nJAKE'S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber -- \nINT. CRYO VAULT \nJAKE'S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY toward us. Wherever we are, we're not on Earth. \nJake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing -- \nWIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO- CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients. \nJAKE (a hoarse whisper) Are we there? \nMED TECH We're there, Sunshine. \nTIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open coffins. \nThe MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice. \nMED TECH People, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience. The staff thanks you in advance. \nFOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an impediment in weightlessness. CUT TO: \nEXT. SPACE \nAgainst the cold infinity   of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE   STAR. As it moves past like an endless train, we realize   this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half a mile long. PAN WITH IT    180 to REVEAL -- \nA GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face. \nThe ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON. CUT TO: \nEXT. PANDORA ORBIT \nISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora. \nCLOSE ON ISV -- two massive \"VALKYRIE\" SHUTTLES are mated to a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts. \nAs the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we-- CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHT \nFLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding. \nThe trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES. \nSuddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to -- \nAN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie- cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story buildings. \nAnd beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY -- \nEXT. HELL'S GATE - TWILIGHT \nHELL'S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high, topped with razor wire. \nAt the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS swiveling on servo mounts. \nVisible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle, bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER. \nEXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHT \nThrough a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block the view. \nA BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound. \nREVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching. \nINT./EXT. SHUTTLE \nThe CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling -- \nCREW CHIEF Exopacks on! \nPassengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps. \nCREW CHIEF Remember people, you lose your mask you're unconscious in 20 seconds and you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report. \nThe crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark -- \nCREW CHIEF Exopack on, let's go! \nBENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear. \nINSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks -- and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone else's WAISTS. \nTHE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine. \nCREW CHIEF Go directly into the base! Do not stop! Go straight inside! \nHAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex. \nInside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid back, hardened, and haggard. \nWAINFLEET Look at all that new meat. \nTHEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp. \nFIKE Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels. \n", "test1_id": 2469, "test2_input": "NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT. NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail. \nJAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It seems to watch Jake. \nTSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face. \nJake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL, offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch? \nJake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm. \nGRACE Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into next week. \nJake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.   They lock eyes. Tsu'tey drinks. \nLATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire. \nWIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS. \nTSU'TEY I thought -- enough drink -- you would not be so ugly. \nJAKE Sorry. \nTsu'tey looks deep into the fire. \nTSU'TEY Your warriors -- hide inside machines -- fight from far away. (he looks at Jake) I did not think a sky person could be brave. \nBefore Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up -- \nNEYTIRI You must dance! It is the way. \nTSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening -- the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger. \nThe hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of dancers. \nJake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting. \nJAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy. \nGRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her. \nJake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other. \nA couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN follow their look, seeing the obvious connection. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsu'tey. \nON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with Neytiri. CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DAY \nWIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast, primeval land. \nUP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest. \nHIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly sensuous image. \nJAKE (V.O.) They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed-- \nMACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.   A blue hand picks the flower. \nJAKE (V.O.) -- and one day you have to give it back. \nLOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads. \nMo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body. \nEarth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO -- \nJAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard. \nJAKE (V.O.) Hard to believe it's only been three months. \nJAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He looks like a junkie watching a test pattern. \nJAKE (to the lens) I can barely remember my old life. I'm not sure who I am anymore. CUT TO: \nEXT. COMPOUND - DAY \nUnder a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center. \nSELFRIDGE Good of you to stop by. How's it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet? \nSelfridge swings his DRIVER with good form. \nSELFRIDGE See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn pack. \nTHE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads 220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it. \nSELFRIDGE The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so -- \nJAKE You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not? \nSELFRIDGE Go ahead. \nGRACE Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But -- we need more time. \nSELFRIDGE Not what I was hoping to hear. \nIt starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open. \nGRACE Parker, it's their ancestral home. They've lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks. \nSELFRIDGE This thing is inevitable. What does it matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr. Augustine. You're out of time. \nHe leaves them standing there to get drenched. CUT TO: \nINT. ARMOR BAY \nA break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake. He studies Jake's pale, sunken face.

Like this \"Well of Souls\" place -- I've got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it will. \nJake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done. \nQUARITCH So you'll get your legs back, like I promised. (puts his hand on Jake's SHOULDER) It's time to come in. \nJake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for? \nJAKE I've gotta finish this thing. There's one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm one of them. They'll trust what I say... \nIt's hard for him to even form these words -- \nJAKE ... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation. \nQUARITCH Then you need to get it done, Corporal. CUT TO: \nEXT. HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS - NIGHT \nStrange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black and heavy with clouds. \nINT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously. \nGRACE Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just not strong enough. \nJAKE It's the last door -- I'm going through it. You can help me or get out of the way. \nJake pushes past her toward the corridor -- \nGRACE (grabbing him) Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death. (MORE) \nGRACE (cont'd) And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm- - we have no idea what that'll do in an avatar brain. \nJake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor. \nGRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside. \nNorm is initializing the Link. \nNORM Calibrating. Thirty seconds. \nShe puts her hands on his shoulders. \nGRACE No matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here. (shaking him) Right here. \nJAKE I have to go all the way -- become one of THEM-- \nGRACE (FURIOUSLY) Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them! \nNorm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice. \nGRACE Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. You visit -- and you leave. \nDuring this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside. \nGRACE (SOFTENING) You can never truly be with her. \nJake stops, pinioned by the truth.   He seems suddenly very lost. \nJAKE You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch sent me. \nNORM What? \nJAKE That's right -- to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn't care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it. \nNorm is in shock.   But Grace is eerily calm. \nGRACE And what about now, Jake? \nJAKE I'm not that guy any more. \nGrace nods.   She's been on his journey every step of the way. \nGRACE I know. \nJAKE But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out -- I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me. \nJake looks hopelessly at the two of them.   In his own perfect Hell. \nNORM They won't understand what you've done. \nJAKE They don't even have a word for \"lie\" -- they had to learn it from us. \nGrace sees he is on the verge of tears.   Lost and alone, between worlds. \nGRACE I know. I taught it to them. \nJAKE (PLEADING) Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting. \nNORM Link is ready. \nGrace stops him as he tries to close the lid. \nGRACE Jake. You can't carry this burden much longer. \nJAKE (smiling wanly) It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway. \nGrace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night. \nGRACE (to Norm) Prep my link. I'm going in. CUT TO: \nINT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT \nJAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the Dream Hunt. \nNEYTIRI When your Spirit Animal comes, you will know. \nTheir eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer. \nTIME CUT.

OPS CENTER/ HELL'S GATE \nON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritch's TRANSPONDER ICON disappears. \nTROOPER Dragon is down. It's off the board. \nSELFRIDGE What do you mean, off the board?! \nSelfridge is stunned.    Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes them all look up. \nOUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH- CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward -- \nSELFRIDGE Oh shit. \nSelfridge DIVES as -- \nK-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris. \nThe slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center -- \nThe TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center. \nSelfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.   In shock. How could this be happening? CUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE \nTHE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning. \nHe slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. \nQUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.    He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK. \nINSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing. \nQUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button-- \nWHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him. \nQuaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor. \nTHE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but -- \nNEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but -- \nQuaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri. \nCLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE and -- \nQUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. \nQUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped. \nQuaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant. \nJAKE (O.S.) It's all over Quaritch -- \nQuaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun. \nQUARITCH Nothing's over while I'm breathing. \nJAKE Kinda hoped you'd say that. \nQUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as -- \nQuaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and -- \nK-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and -- \nSMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying. \nQUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before -- \nTHUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and -- \nJAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but -- \nINSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and -- \nFROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside. \nINSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -- \nP-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE. \nNEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. \nQUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake. \nQUARITCH How does it feel to betray your own race? \nThen, inexplicably, he TURNS.   Walks away. \nFROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and -- \nCRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. He is reaching inside for the Link when -- \nJAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and -- \nJAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but -- \nQUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground. \nINSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK. \nNEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out. \nTHE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -- \nJAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- \nQUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. \nINSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as -- \n", "test3_true": "THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest.   He looks up. \nNEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly. \nTH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still. \nQUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies. \nNEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow. \nJAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and -- \nINT. SHACK \nHUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room. \nHe scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness. \nNEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's side -- puts the mask over his face and -- \nJAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for the first time. \nJake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin.

Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her expression, it is clear he cannot be saved. \nJake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes.   Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake. \nTSU'TEY (NA'VI) I See you, Jakesully. \nJAKE I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan. \nTSU'TEY Are the people safe? \nJAKE They're safe. \nTsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue. \nTSU'TEY I can never ride again, or bond with my woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will lead them, Jakesully. \nJAKE No. I'm not officer material. \nTSU'TEY It is decided. Now do the duty of Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free. \nJAKE I'm not killing you. \nTSU'TEY I am already dead. \nJAKE No. \nTSU'TEY It is the way. And it is good. I will be remembered -- \nTsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion. \nTSU'TEY -- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were brothers -- and he was my last shadow. \nTSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake draws his knife. \nTSU'TEY'S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun. HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey. \nJAKE (NA'VI) Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit. \nBy his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain. Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we -- DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HELL'S GATE -DAY \nNa'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's Gate. \nBanshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and the GATES are open to the forest. \nJAKE (V.O.) A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen. \nMax, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR's as the personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry, like POW's. \nJAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of the Sky People. \nPARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes of a lost soul -- meet JAKE'S. He disappears into the ship. CUT TO: \nEXT. SPACE \nISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of PANDORA. The ISV's antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it accelerates out of orbit. \nWhat remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora. CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DAY \nThe sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy. \nJAKE (V.O.) The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world. \nNEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows. Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river. \nJAKE (V.O.) This is my last videolog. \nINT. LINK ROOM \nVIDEO IMAGE -- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight TO CAMERA. He is thin, pale. He looks around the high tech room. \nJAKE The science guys will keep the lights on, here. But I won't miss this place. \nEXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT \nTHE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree. \nJAKE (V.O.) I better wrap this up. There's a funeral tonight, and I don't want to be late. It was someone very close to me. \nWIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people, all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above -- \nNEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais -- \nJAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA. \nCAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her fingertips. Then bends and kisses him. \n", "test3_id": 2471}

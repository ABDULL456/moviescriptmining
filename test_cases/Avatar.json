{"train": "AVATAR \nWritten by \nJames Cameron \nTHE SOUND OF DRUMS, from a great distance, growing louder. \nFADE IN: \nWE ARE FLYING through mist, a dimly glimpsed forest below. \nVOICE (V.O.) When I was lying there in the VA hospital, with a big hole blown through the middle of my life, I started having these dreams of flying. \nWe are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums BUILDING to a PEAK -- \nVOICE (V.O.) Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... CUT TO: \nEXT. CITY - NIGHT \nA SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing -- \nJAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years. \nJake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish advertizing. \nJAKE (V.O.) They can fix a spinal, if you've got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy. \nThe traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous, isolated souls. \nINT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom. Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. -- \nPERKY NEWSCASTER The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a century, is making a comeback. These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are... \nJake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side, pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the other, and so on. \nHis legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A \"Born Loser\" tattoo prominent on his shoulder. \nJAKE (V.O.) I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. \nJake struggles with his pants a long time. CUT TO: \nINT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT \nNot the kind of place you'd bring your mom. \nWe find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets, CLAP and WHOOP. \nJake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer. \nA WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men RUNNING on antelope legs. \nCU JAKE, watching what he can't have.    Expression stony. \nJAKE (V.O.) Let's get it straight up front. I don't want your pity. I know the world's a cold-ass bitch. \nJake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with. Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away. \nCU JAKE -- not looking away. \nJAKE (V.O.) You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak. \nTIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair. \nTRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's just the way things are.   And nobody does a damn thing. \nJake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS. \nThe chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and -- \nJAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor. \nTHE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling... \nJAKE (V.O.) All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for. CUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT \nTHE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash. \nJake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight. \nJAKE I hope you realize you've just lost a customer! \nHe collapses onto his back, panting. \nJAKE (to himself) Candy ass bitch. \nHe stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking -- then shouts jauntily to no one in particular -- \nJAKE If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled amongst the trash, getting drenched. \nTWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him. \nJake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.   He squints up at -- \nTWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors. \nAGENT 1 Are you Jake Sully? \nJAKE Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood. \nAGENT 2 It's about your brother. CUT TO: \nINT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT \nDOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY. \nJAKE (V.O.) The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet. \nWAINFLEET That is just wrong. \nJake, pumping his chair, looks around as -- \nA huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires -- ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. \nBeyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and heavily armed, they are AT-99 \"SCORPION\" GUNSHIPS. \nMITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4 meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90. \nBeyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege. \nWAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches. \nJAKE What're you two limpdicks starin' at? \nAs Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and -- \nK-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his head. \nA vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT. \nWAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.   It drops off the fence, tail still lashing. \nWAINFLEET Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one. \nJake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien. \nON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below. \nThe hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars. \nThe MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.    He eyes are an icy steel gray. \nHIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds. \nMAN (V.O.) You are not in Kansas any more... CUT TO: \nINT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT \nTHE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide. \nWithout his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very large PISTOL. \nQUARITCH ... You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day. \nJAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back. \nCOLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline. \nQUARITCH Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees. \nThe room gets very quiet. \nQUARITCH We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate -- we live -- at a constant threat condition yellow. \nPAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers, engineers, geologists, as they take that in. \nQUARITCH As head of security, it's my job to keep you alive.    I will not succeed -- (pausing for effect) -- not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure... \nPUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues. \nJAKE (V.O.) Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease. CUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR \nPeople are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms, lugging duffels and cases. \nAn eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake. \nNORM Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother? You look just like him. (off Jake's wary look) Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him. \nNorm offers his hand and Jake shakes it. \nNORM He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a big shock to all of us. \nJAKE Yeah. \nJake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.       Norm walks with him. \nNORM And duh! -- obviously you look like him. I mean, if you weren't genetically identical, you wouldn't be taking over his avatar. \nJAKE That's why I'm here. \nNORM So -- you want to go check it out? CUT TO: \nINT. BIO-LAB - DAY \nJAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms. \nMAX Me and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. They're grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here. \nA scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK. \nNorm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward -- \nTHE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside, which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man. \nBlood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed. \nJAKE Damn.   They got big. \nNORM Yeah, they mature on the trip out. (to Max) So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well. \nMAX Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin. \nTHE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout -- definitely JAKE'S. \nJAKE It looks like him. \nNORM No, it looks like you.   This is your avatar now, Jake. \nON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank. \nJAKE (V.O.) The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar -- \nJake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks. \nNorm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric sensors. \nGRACE How much link time have you logged? \nNORM Five hundred and twenty hours. \nGrace looks pointedly at Jake. \nJAKE Like -- an hour. \nGRACE Tell me you're joking. \nGrace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to help him but -- \nJAKE Don't!   I got this. \nGrace steps back, hands raised.    He drags himself into the unit. \nGRACE So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head? \nHe meets her eyes with a defiant glare. \nJAKE Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn't do. \nGrace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand. \nJake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL -- \nGRACE Relax and let your mind go blank.    That shouldn't be hard for you. \nJAKE Kiss the darkest part of my lily white -- \nBut the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest. \nMAX Initiate link. \nThe LINK TECH touches some controls. \nON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake's brain appears. Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors. \nMAX That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity. \nGRACE Go figure. (walking away) Alright, I'm going in. \nTECH Phase-lock at forty percent.    He's in transition. \nMax watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system aligning with Jake's -- two ghostly networks of light merging. \nMAX That's it.     Find your way home. \nECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as -- \nINSIDE JAKE'S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and -- \nTHE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing masks, looking down. \nECU JAKE'S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life. \nMAX He's in. \nTECH Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link is stable. \nBlinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand. \nMAX Take it slow, Jake. We need to check your motor control. Try touching your fingertips together -- \nBut Jake isn't listening. He's staring at his legs.     He eases them off the gurney and -- \nHIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight. \nJAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs.    His expression is child-like with wonder. \nHIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size of children next to his 9' tall frame. \nHe sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL. \nAs he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max. \nMED TECH Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down -- \nBut Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio- monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest. \nMAX Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests -- \nBut Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the door and -- \nEXT. AVATAR COMPOUND - DAY \nJake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area. \nNearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about their daily activities around the compound. \nJake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful. \nHe takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's running. RUNNING! \nHe finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world. \nGRACE (O.S.) Hey Marine! \nJake turns at the familiar voice to see -- \nA statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt. In human years she would be about 35. \nJAKE Grace? \nGRACE Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think fast! \nShe throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches. \nGRACE Motor control is looking good. \nJake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin. \nHe points to his scarred face. \nQUARITCH They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what's out there. Besides, I can't leave -- \nHe looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree- line. \nQUARITCH This is my war, here. \nQuaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up with a rising WHINE. \nQUARITCH The avatar program is a joke -- buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp. \nThe WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with power. The air boils above the exhaust vents. \nQuaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic -- \nQUARITCH Looks good. (to Jake) I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or bagged-and-tagged. \nJAKE (NODDING) That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am I still with Augustine? \nQUARITCH On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for me? \nJake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly. \nHe balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined. \nQUARITCH Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. \nHe raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG! \nINT. BIO LAB - DAY \nGRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX. \nGRACE Start calibrating. We're on the flight line in ten minutes. \nMax nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR. \nGRACE What did Atilla want? \nJAKE Just Marines comparin' tattoos. \nGRACE (not buying it) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine -- \nShe stops, turning to drill him with a look. \nGRACE -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That means you're in my world, got it? \nJAKE Got it. \nShe turns and enters the LINK ROOM. \nINT. LINK ROOM \nGrace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the others catch up -- \nGRACE That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this -- (indicating link room) -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore. \nJAKE Then how's this supposed to work? \nGRACE We have a new face. (turning to Norm) You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good. \nNORM This is failing as a pep talk. \nJake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link. \nJAKE How do we contact them? \nGRACE We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us. \nJAKE Or they may skin us and make a drum. \nJake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body. \nGRACE Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking. \nShe closes his clamshell, HARD, and we -- CUT TO: \nEXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY \nFLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape. \nANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun, scanning for aerial predators. \nIn avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes. Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids. \nTRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a shallow river. \nTRUDY (INTERCOM) Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock. \nNorm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-- A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river. \nGRACE Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles. \nNORM The bull has the red on the dorsal armor? \nGrace nods approvingly. \nTIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS. \nTIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run. \nWainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke. \nWAINFLEET Yo Chacon!     Get some! \nJake grins into the airstream. CUT TO: \nEXT. CLEARING - DAY \nA small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like \"grass\" is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson settles to the ground. \nJake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle. \nHe and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree- line warily, weapons aimed. \nSOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus -- \nA THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the Alien for desert. \nIt is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws. \nJAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead -- \nJAKE That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch! \nThe bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away through splintering undergrowth. \nJAKE That's right motherf-- \nA guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see -- \nTHREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes. \nThe thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS. \nJAKE What about this one?       Run, don't run? What? \nGRACE Run.     Definitely RUN! \nJake BOLTS as -- \nThe thanator LEAPS after him and -- \nJake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while -- \nJake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and -- \nSK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off a trunk as -- \nJAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but -- \nJAKE dives under a massive root system, and -- \nCRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he rolls and crawls -- \nGlistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across Jake, jaws inches away as -- \nHe rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK away. Jake scrambles to escape but -- \nGLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and -- \nThe creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit, only -- \nIt has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and -- \nHe FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but -- \nWith a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him, splintering trees. \nJAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and -- \nHe sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might -- \nThe thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies out into open space and -- \nJAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river. \nThe thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon. \nJake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past his face amid turbulent bubbles. \nA WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and -- \nJake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract. \nEXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY \nThe water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts through the surface, and he gasps for breath. \nHe is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just lies there gasping on the trunk. \nAbove him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which echoes across the jungle. CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DAY \nJAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant leaves.   He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip. \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DAY \nTRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked and hyper-alert. \nThe trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom. \nPOV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake move warily through the forest. \nECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows. \nDOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving. \nShe is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders, and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful -- for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree). \nJake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious. \nNEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT JAKE. Utterly silent. \nBelow her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his THROAT. \nON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing for the shot -- \n-- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She hesitates. \nRACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It glows faintly in the dark shadows. \nNEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom. CUT TO: \nINT./EXT. SAMSON - SUNSET \nGRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY banks in a search pattern. \nTRUDY (INTERCOM) I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders. \n-- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an infant. \n--children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks with laughter as she runs back to her playmates. \nGRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed MARE. His grin drops. \nEXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY \nJAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts. \nJake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue. He hesitantly touches them together and -- \nTIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE. \nJake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her fingertips to the neural interface. \nNEYTIRI This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong legs. \nJake closes his eyes, nodding.   One with the horse. \nTSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson with disdain. \nNEYTIRI You may tell her what to do -- (she touches her head) -- inside. For now, say where to go. \nJAKE Forward. \nThe horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He lands painfully in the mud. \nHe gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads the horse back to him. \nNEYTIRI Again. \nSERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time. \nON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees -- \nTSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their hooves. \nJake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next to him, looking down with disdain. \nTSU'TEY You should go away. \nJAKE (to Neytiri) I knew this guy could speak English. \nTsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) This alien will learn nothing.   A rock Sees more. \nShe sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods. \nNEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse. \nNEYTIRI Again. CUT TO: \nOPS CENTER - NIGHT \nGrouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure. \nJAKE You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down. \nQUARITCH I'm going to need accurate scans of all these columns. \nJAKE Roger that. \nANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning, he backs away, down the stairs. CUT TO: \nINT. BIO LAB - DAY \nJAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies. \nGRACE I'm not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing. (she looks pointedly at Jake) We're going up into the mountains. (MORE) \nGRACE (cont'd) There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that we can work out of. \nNORM The Hallelujah Mountains? \nGRACE That's right. \nNORM Yesssss! (off Jake's look) The legendary Floating Mountains of Pandora? Heard of them? CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - AERIAL - DAY \nA SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist- shrouded mountains. \nIn the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats. \nGrace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back compartment. \nTRUDY It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put your hand on the cyclic -- \nShe points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers. \nTRUDY Feel how small the moves are? You barely have to think it, and the aircraft reacts. \nON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot. \nTHE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK. \nGRACE See these magnetic formations.   We're getting close. \nTRUDY Yeah we are. Look at my instruments. \nOn the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out. \nGRACE Yup. We're in the flux vortex. \nAHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing -- \nTHE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.   Right in front of them. \nNORM Oh. My. God. \nJake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy. \nJAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest, and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them. Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom. \nJAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward. \nThey reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them. \nSome of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss. \nOne by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass. \nJake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands above. \nEXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY \nTINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis. \nWIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome -- the sheer side of Mons Veritatis. \nBanshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below. \nEXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY \nA waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below -- a view from Olympus. \nA SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD. It waits, docile, as -- \nShe joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And Jake sees -- \nThe BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out- croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges. \nTSU'TEY Jakesully will go first. \nTsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough. \nTsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge. \nNEYTIRI (WHISPERING) Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel -- inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance. \nJAKE How will I know if he chooses me? \nNEYTIRI He will try to kill you. \nJAKE Outstanding. \nOut of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with -- \nThe BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display. \nJake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO. \nA LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares straight at him. \nJake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it. \nJAKE Let's dance. \nThe challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as-- \nJake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT. \nJake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but -- \nJake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head. \nJake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his queue but -- \nThe bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and -- \nIT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as -- \nNEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly. \nThe bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but -- \nJake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and -- \nGrabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and -- \nThe banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They are locked together, literally eye to eye. \nJAKE That's right! You're mine. \nECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well. \nJake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creature's back. \nNeytiri runs to him. \nNEYTIRI First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait. \nJake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips a hank of the beast's main, and -- \nJAKE Heeeyyyaaaah! \nTHWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and -- \nThey fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so much he can't think. \nJAKE Shut the hell up!! \nIt does. \nJAKE Level out!     Fly straight! \nIt levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking \"bank left\" and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath. \nNEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals \"follow me\" and DIVES. \nJake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky. \nTHE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning. They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines. \nNeytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight. \nJake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back. He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT. \nNeytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy. CUT TO: \nNEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT. NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail. \nJAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It seems to watch Jake. \nTSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face. \nJake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL, offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch? \nJake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm. \nGRACE Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into next week. \nJake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.   They lock eyes. Tsu'tey drinks. \nLATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire. \nWIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS. \nTSU'TEY I thought -- enough drink -- you would not be so ugly. \nJAKE Sorry. \nTsu'tey looks deep into the fire. \nTSU'TEY Your warriors -- hide inside machines -- fight from far away. (he looks at Jake) I did not think a sky person could be brave. \nBefore Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up -- \nNEYTIRI You must dance! It is the way. \nTSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening -- the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger. \nThe hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of dancers. \nJake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting. \nJAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy. \nGRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her. \nJake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other. \nA couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN follow their look, seeing the obvious connection. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsu'tey. \nON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with Neytiri. CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DAY \nWIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast, primeval land. \nUP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest. \nHIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly sensuous image. \nJAKE (V.O.) They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed-- \nMACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.   A blue hand picks the flower. \nJAKE (V.O.) -- and one day you have to give it back. \nLOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads. \nMo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body. \nEarth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO -- \nJAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard. \nJAKE (V.O.) Hard to believe it's only been three months. \nJAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He looks like a junkie watching a test pattern. \nJAKE (to the lens) I can barely remember my old life. I'm not sure who I am anymore. CUT TO: \nEXT. COMPOUND - DAY \nUnder a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center. \nSELFRIDGE Good of you to stop by. How's it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet? \nSelfridge swings his DRIVER with good form. \nSELFRIDGE See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn pack. \nTHE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads 220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it. \nSELFRIDGE The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so -- \nJAKE You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not? \nSELFRIDGE Go ahead. \nGRACE Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But -- we need more time. \nSELFRIDGE Not what I was hoping to hear. \nIt starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open. \nGRACE Parker, it's their ancestral home. They've lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks. \nSELFRIDGE This thing is inevitable. What does it matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr. Augustine. You're out of time. \nHe leaves them standing there to get drenched. CUT TO: \nINT. ARMOR BAY \nA break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake. He studies Jake's pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard. \nQUARITCH You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are you son? \nJake can't meet his eyes. \nBELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM. \nTIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms. \nMACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision. \nMO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does. \nMACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion. \nHe places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and -- \nJake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle. \nNeytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant. \nSLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening. \nJake looks down at the palms of his hands. \nJAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground and -- \nINSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS. \nECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and -- \nThe onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance. Jake looks down -- \nJAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and -- \nCUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but -- \nIN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW. \nCAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which FILLS THE UNIVERSE and -- \nREAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his head, while inside -- \nTIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the wind of time blowing through him as -- \nREAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -- \nINSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora -- \n--but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. \nA great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow. Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and -- \nPULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and -- \nSLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room. \nMO'AT It is finished. \nNeytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Did your Spirit Animal come? \nJake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? \nMo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul. \nMO'AT (to Jake) Something has come. (to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear. \nShe steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly. \nOUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. \nGRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed. \nEytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them there. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You are part of the People. \nAll the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest -- hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone. DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT \nJAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS RISES behind the trees. \nNEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water. Jake follows her and -- \nUNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES. \nThey seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them. \nTheir hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds. DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WILLOW GLADE \nLaughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. \nUnderfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. \nIt is an exquisitely beautiful spot. \nThe willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her. \nNEYTIRI This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. \nJake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES. \nJAKE It's like -- a sound you feel. \nNEYTIRI We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa. \nA few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. \nThey stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous. He feels drawn into them. \nBut she pulls back a little. \nNEYTIRI You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. (she looks away) And you may choose a woman. \nHe positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic juggernaut will see him. \nINT. OPS CENTER - DAY \nCLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed. \nWIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR. \nOPERATOR Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my blade here. \nThis attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to the workstation. \nON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable. \nSUPERVISOR (to Selfridge) What do we do? \nSELFRIDGE Roll on. He'll move. These people have to learn that we don't stop. \nTIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward. \nON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side. \nEXT. WILLOW GLADE \nJAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.   He climbs quickly to the CAMERA MAST. \nSMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk. \nINT. OPS CENTER \nCLOSE ON MONITOR -- as Jake's demonic face is replaced by noise. \nOPERATOR I'm blind. \nHe pulls back on the throttles. \nEXT. WILLOW GLADE \nTHE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines continues because -- \nMORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS. Terrified animals flee before the onslaught. \nPOWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest, blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the dozer. He rips off a BURST and -- \nRounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From behind a screen of leaves, they watch as -- \nTHE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path. \nCU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die. \nINT. OPS CENTER \nMINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERA'S FEED for Quaritch and the others. \nQUARITCH Freeze it, right -- there. \nON MONITOR -- the image expands, until Jake's face is clear, frozen in an animal snarl. \nSELFRIDGE Son of a bitch! \nPUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury. \nHe turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH COMMANDER as he passes. \nQUARITCH Get me a pilot! CUT TO: \nINT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - DAY \nA RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise weapons overhead. AVATAR GRACE watches with growing alarm. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Tsu'tey will lead the war party! \nTsu'tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry among the hunters. \nGRACE (SUBTITLED) Please -- this will only make it worse -- \nTSU'TEY You do not speak here! \nJAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her. \nJAKE (to Neytiri, low) Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to -- \nHe sees TSU'TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of fury. \nTSU'TEY You! \nTsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass. \nTSU'TEY You mated with this woman?! \nGRACE Oh shit. \nJake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.   She goes to him, clutching his hand. \nMO'AT Is this true? \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) We are mated before Eywa. It is done. \nTsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is changing. Everything is being destroyed! \nTsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison. \nMO'AT Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can never be Tsahik. Your life will be wasted. \nNeytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes. \nNEYTIRI I have chosen. \nTsu'tey draws his knife and -- \nTSU'TEY Yeeeeeaaa! \nGRACE Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog! \nSELFRIDGE Can we just take this down a couple notches, please. \nJAKE (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. \nJake nods to Grace to continue. \nGRACE (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine. \nSELFRIDGE You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern. \nGRACE I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest. \nSELFRIDGE (FRUSTRATED) Which is what exactly? \nGrace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor. \nGRACE (to Jake) I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate? \nJAKE Just tell him what you know in your heart. \nShe turns to Parker, steeling herself. \nGRACE Alright, look -- I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora -- \nSELFRIDGE That's a lot I'm guessing. \nGRACE That's more connections than the human brain. You get it? It's a network -- a global network. And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed. \nSELFRIDGE What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just. Goddamn. Trees. \nGRACE You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground -- it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. \nQUARITCH We understand them just fine.   Thanks to Jake here. \nJake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a NEW CLIP on the main monitor -- \nTIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue. \nJAKE (RECORDED) They're not going to give up their home -- they're not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There's nothing we have that they want. We're a horror to them. We're the monsters from space. \nJAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love. \nJAKE (RECORDED) They're never going to leave Hometree. \nQuaritch FREEZES the recording. \nQUARITCH Since a deal can't be made -- it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I might just give you a big wet kiss. \nGRACE Parker, we have to talk, like rational people. \nSELFRIDGE Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now. \nON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless. SLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nA WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW MOTION, spears and bows held high. \nINT. OPS CENTER - MORNING \nMONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows. \nWAINFLEET They hit with banshees first. Set the ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast. \nQuaritch and Selfridge look on grimly. \nQUARITCH The rest of the squad? \nWAINFLEET Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the equipment is totalled. \nSELFRIDGE Christ. \nINT. SELFRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSelfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan. \nQUARITCH I can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. We'll clear them out with gas first. It'll be humane. More or less. \nSelfridge sighs and rubs his face. \nQUARITCH Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is exactly the incident we needed. \nSELFRIDGE Alright, let's pull the trigger. CUT TO: \nINT. BIO LAB \nMAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE, GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other. \nGRACE They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They're fabricating this war to get what they want. \nNORM I can't believe that. \nJAKE Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it. \nTRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet. \nTRUDY Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're gonna hit Hometree! \nJAKE When? \nTRUDY Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go. \nGRACE My God. \nJake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following. \nINT. OPS CENTER - DAY \nSELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE charge toward him. \nGRACE Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you're about to -- \nSELFRIDGE They're fly-bitten savages who live in a tree! Look around -- I don't know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can move. \nGRACE For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies! \nMO'AT You are one of us.   Help us! \nJake takes the knife and cuts Grace free. \nJAKE We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the columns. \nAs Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN. Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion. \nIN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches. \nQUARITCH That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay, switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the base of the west columns. \nPILOTS (V.O.) Copy, switching missiles. \nIN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging Quaritch's order. \nTRUDY Screw it. \nShe takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her aircraft out of formation. \nPUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his glasses. \nQUARITCH Bring it down. \nMISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships and -- \nThe base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and -- \nThe Omaticaya watch in horror as -- \nHOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE. \nIn a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness. \nAT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES. \nIt CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY. \nHOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris. \nIN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction. \nQUARITCH Nice work people. Alright, let's light it up. \nINCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts of FIRE in the debris of Hometree. \nTHE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire- storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances. \nJAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks. \nJAKE Neytiri!   Neytiri! \nGRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away from the fire-storm. \nNEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the INFERNO. She sees -- \nEYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the People. \nIn his last living moment he places his bow in her hands. \nShe collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief. \nJAKE reels out of the smoke.    Kneels next to her. \nJAKE I'm sorry -- \nShe shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears stream down her face. \nNEYTIRI Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come back! \nJake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body. Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as -- \nNETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her stomach. Keening like an animal. \nSLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant. \nJAKE (V.O.) I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... \nINT. LINK ROOM \nSELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock. \nSELFRIDGE Pull the plug. \nA TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the MASTER BREAKER -- \nEXT. RAINFOREST \nThe strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp. \nElsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of Omaticaya, comes upon the scene. \nShe grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates, then -- \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) Bring her. \nINT. LINK ROOM \nBLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we -- CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK \nON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a travois. \nThey watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A great pall of smoke darkens the landscape. DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LOCK-UP - NIGHT \nJake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally drained to move. \nGRACE They never wanted us to succeed. \nAT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as -- \nTrudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus. Her instruments are showing gibberish. \nTRUDY Well, at least they won't be able to track us up here. Not this deep in the vortex. \nJAKE It's strongest at the Well of Souls, right? \nTRUDY Yeah. \nJAKE Good, `cause that's where we're going. \nTRUDY Copy. \nHe gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain. \nJAKE I'm gonna get you some help, Grace. \nGRACE Forget it, it doesn't matter. \nJake grabs her shoulders. \nJAKE No!   The People can help you. I know it. CUT TO: \nEXT. WELL OF SOULS - AERIAL - DAWN \nDawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above the Well of Souls. \nTiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes. \nJAKE (V.O.) The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I knew the People would go there. \nEXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN \nThe WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down the sheer rock walls like candle wax. \nAT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping which forms a kind of dais and altar. \nShafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto, lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock. \nIts ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a braided mat resembling the surface of a brain. \nMo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) Wise ancestors who live within Eywa, guide us. Give us a sign. CUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING   - DAWN \nThe shack descends from the sky like a gift from the gods. It bumps to the ground. CUT TO: \nINT. SHACK -- DAY \nGrace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a look that says \"not much time.\" Jake feels Grace's cold forehead, then crosses to his own link. \nAs Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system. \nNORM (LOW) Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not going to let you get near that place. \nJAKE I've gotta try, Norm. \nJake pulls the clamshell down and we -- CUT TO: \nEXT. RUINS OF HOMETREE - DAY \nCU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind. \nJAKE (V.O.) Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules. \nDISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen. Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell. \nJAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around him. \nA SCREECH.    Jake looks up as -- \nHIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse. \nJAKE (V.O.) Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. \nJAKE Come on, boy. Time to fly. \nOMIITED \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY \nTHE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him. \nIt scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head cocking left, then right. \nJAKE (V.O.) The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? \nFROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across the back of the mighty Toruk. \nJAKE (V.O.) But that was just a theory. \nJAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our own shadow then -- CUT TO: \nEXT. WELL OF SOULS - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance. \nCLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.   She looks up, and her eyes go wide as -- \nA TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.   AN ENORMOUS SHADOW covers the crowd as -- \nTORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within. \nThe People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. And that's when they see -- \nJAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed Na'vi. \nToruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animal's flank. \nNEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them. \nNEYTIRI (breathing the words) Toruk Macto. \nNeytiri raises her arms. \nJAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him. \nJAKE The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land! \nTSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest. \nJAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.   He vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him. \nTHE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it. \nLONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different directions. CUT TO: \nEXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT \nJAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the words. \nTRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in flickering fire-light. \nJAKE (V.O.) We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came. \nVARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows, spurring their mounts to leap skyward. CUT TO: \nEXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN \nWith a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS. Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount. \nAround them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.   A gathering of eagles. \nFROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it. \nDIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails. \nBANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the grotto. \nJAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army gathering. CUT TO: \nINT. COMMISSARY - DAY \nIt's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing. \nQUARITCH People, you are fighting for survival. There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide. \nThe display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.    It looks like Woodstock in the jungle. \nQUARITCH These orbital images show the hostiles' numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can't wait. Our only security lies in pre- emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror. \nTRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers. Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes. \nQUARITCH Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won't come within a thousand klicks of this place. CUT TO: \nINT. ARMOR BAY - DAY \nTROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red- blooded redneck NRA supporters they are. \nBLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are band-strapped together on pallets. \nTRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay as he walks through the full-scale mobilization. \nHe approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of activity around the ampsuits. \nSELFRIDGE This thing is completely out of control! \nQuaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance loading. \nSELFRIDGE Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to turn the mine-workers local into a freakin' militia! \nQUARITCH I declared threat condition red. That puts all on-world assets under my command. \nSELFRIDGE You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call -- \nQuaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an ampsuit. \nQUARITCH You're a long way from Earth. \nSelfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him? Quaritch releases him and walks away. \nQUARITCH (to his men) Get him out of here. \nSeveral troopers converge on Selfridge. \nSELFRIDGE You touch me you're so fired. \nHe pushes through them and they escort him toward the door. CUT TO: \nINT. SHACK - DAY \nHUMAN JAKE, NORM and TRUDY are gathered around the comms monitor, talking to MAX. \nMAX I don't know how secure this channel is. \nJAKE Talk fast. \nMAX It's crazy here, Jake. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttles as bombers. They've made up these big pallets of mine explosives. It's for some kind of shock and awe campaign. \nTRUDY Frickin' daisycutters. \nNORM Holy shit. \nJAKE (to Max) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way. \nMAX No, Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling and there's no stopping him. \nJAKE When? \nMAX Oh six hundred tomorrow. \nJake takes that in. \nJAKE Thanks. \nMax signs off. \nNORM We're screwed. \nTRUDY You know he's gonna commit those bombers straight to the Well of Souls. \nUP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables. Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward, leading the army into the forest. \nLYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display -- ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES. \nWAINFLEET Contact. Two hundred meters. \nA chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around, spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from. \nThen they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.    They grip their weapons, bracing themselves as -- \nTHREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an awesome sight. \nNORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an assault rifle. \nTHE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters raise their bows as -- \nTHE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's. \nON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders. \nQUARITCH Fire for effect. \nThe entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the jungle, blasting foliage into confetti. \nCHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as -- \nRIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto. \nTWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down. \nNORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as -- \nA WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but -- \nTHE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse. Riders pivot their mounts to flee and -- \nTHE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders scattering. \nLYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at moving targets. \nOVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running along the branches. \nAs the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire and -- \nTROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets Jake taught them, but -- \nTHE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS. TRACERS rip through the foliage and -- \nNA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet. \nNORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his HANDSET -- \nNORM Jake!   Jake! We're falling back! \nSURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.   It is a total rout. \nIN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures streaming through the forest below. \nQUARITCH Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will. \nLed by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts. Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle -- \nSTROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught. \nHUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest. \nINSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp. \nTHE PALLET falls into the jungle below and -- \nBA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions. \nAT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves. \nIN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five. \nTROOPERS Yeah baby!     Get some! \nGROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU- 90's. \nEXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL \nQuaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of Truth. \nQUARITCH Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red team, with me. We're punching for the main target. \nQuaritch glances up to see -- \nA squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey. \nCLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as he leads the charge and -- \nSCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined. \nJAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X shape just before -- \nK-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE can barely hang onto the gyrating creature. \nThe pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees. There is a satisfying FIREBALL. \nSCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, FIRING cannons and rockets. \nJAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion. \nJAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and -- \nThe Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees. \nDOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like Messerschmidts from a B-17 as -- \nWE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops in from its blind spot and -- \nTHE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them, SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy. \nA SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to- air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION. \nTHE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits. Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated. \nNEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the gloom as -- \nVIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as their attackers. \nThe survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of the shadows. \nJAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky. \nJAKE What the hell -- ? \nThe wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them. \nON JAKE -- slowly getting it.   EYWA is in the fight. \nJAKE WHOO-HOOOO! \nA GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield. \nNEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her. \nShe senses something and turns slowly to see -- \nA THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze-- \n-- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting. \nTrembling, she approaches the waiting demon. \nEXT. FOREST \nA smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked yelling fills the comm freq. \nWAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through the smoky gloom. \nWAINFLEET A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I want -- (screaming on the comm) Who's screaming God damn it?! \nTROOPER (ON RADIO) We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in charge, call for extraction! \nWAINFLEET Shutup you crybabies! \nSOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He moves through a screen of foliage to reveal -- \nThe AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see -- \nA THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his cannon but-- \nWHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws, right outside his canopy-- \nOn its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling as it poises to strike and -- \nK-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy. Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief. \nNeytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes through the forest. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nMax runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.   He's yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET -- \nMAX Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max.   Tell Jake we are in motion. (to the scientists) Get in there. Barricade the door! \nINT. LINK ROOM \nThe door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in. \nScience geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble into their link units, pulling the clamshells down. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nMax checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a connecting corridor. CUT TO: \nEXT. SHACK \nHUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL \nJAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures. \nTHE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers. \nHUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in. They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage. \nThe panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear. \nJAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as -- \nGUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them with his AR, still running forward and -- \nJAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of the VTOL turbofans as -- \nHIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and -- \nHE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and -- \nJAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle. \nON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping. \nPILOT Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me airspeed! \nThe pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and -- \nThe FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.    It still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until -- \nIT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and -- \nTHE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose. \nPILOT We're good! \nBEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and -- \nTHOONK!   ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests. \nNorm takes a few steps and drops to his knees.    Imploded by grief. \nINT. OPS CENTER/ HELL'S GATE \nON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritch's TRANSPONDER ICON disappears. \nTROOPER Dragon is down. It's off the board. \nSELFRIDGE What do you mean, off the board?! \nSelfridge is stunned.    Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes them all look up. \nOUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH- CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward -- \nSELFRIDGE Oh shit. \nSelfridge DIVES as -- \nK-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris. \nThe slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center -- \nThe TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center. \nSelfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.   In shock. How could this be happening? CUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE \nTHE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning. \nHe slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. \nQUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.    He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK. \nINSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing. \nQUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button-- \nWHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him. \nQuaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor. \nTHE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but -- \nNEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but -- \nQuaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri. \nCLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE and -- \nQUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. \nQUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped. \nQuaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant. \nJAKE (O.S.) It's all over Quaritch -- \nQuaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun. \nQUARITCH Nothing's over while I'm breathing. \nJAKE Kinda hoped you'd say that. \nQUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as -- \nQuaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and -- \nK-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and -- \nSMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying. \nQUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before -- \nTHUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and -- \nJAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but -- \nINSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and -- \nFROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside. \nINSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -- \nP-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE. \nNEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. \nQUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake. \nQUARITCH How does it feel to betray your own race? \nThen, inexplicably, he TURNS.   Walks away. \nFROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and -- \nCRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. He is reaching inside for the Link when -- \nJAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and -- \nJAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but -- \nQUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground. \nINSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK. \nNEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out. \nTHE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -- \nJAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- \nQUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. \nINSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as -- \n", "test1_input": "Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal. \nNEYTIRI (in Na'vi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother. \nJAKE I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along -- \nShe rises and walks away without looking at Jake. \nJAKE Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'? \nHe crashes through some plants, catching up to her. \nJAKE Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those -- \nHe makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and -- \nWHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat. \nHe looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English. \nNEYTIRI Don't thank! You don't thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only. \nJAKE Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm sorry. \nShe gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves. \nNEYTIRI All this is your fault! They did not need to die. \nJAKE They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy HERE-- \nShe silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat. \nNEYTIRI Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only. \nJake gets up, slowly, facing her. \nJAKE Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking? \nCU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs. \nNEYTIRI Why save you? \nJAKE Yes, why save me? \nNEYTIRI You have a strong heart.   No fear. \nShe leans closer -- \nNEYTIRI But stupid! Ignorant like a child! \nShe turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her. \nTRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT. \nWIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway. \nJake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST. \nJAKE If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me. \nNEYTIRI Sky people can not learn.   You do not See. \nShe leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised that he made it. \nJAKE Whooaa. \nHe runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace. \nJAKE Then teach me to \"see.\" \nShe stops and he almost runs into her. \nNEYTIRI No one can teach you to See. \nThen she turns and trots on. \nEXT. GORGE - NIGHT \nThey run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a horizontal trunk big as an oak. \nWIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers. \nJAKE Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and -- \nJake looks down, suddenly aware of the height. \nJAKE --you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull-- \nA vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops the spear and almost falls off the root. \nJAKE Whooaaa -- shit! \nNeytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river. \nShe pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi. \nJAKE I need your help. \nNEYTIRI You should not be here. \nJAKE So take me with you. \nNEYTIRI No. You go back. \nDOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently toward Jake and Neytiri. \nNEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see -- \nThe WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head. \nJAKE (off her amazed look) What? \nMore woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him. \nJake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body. \n", "test1_true": "CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread. \nNEYTIRI Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree -- very pure spirits. \nJake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT -- moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until -- \n-- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering into the darkness. \nJAKE What was that all about? \nNeytiri seems shaken.   She seizes his hand and pulls him after her. \nNEYTIRI Come! CUT TO: \nEXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT \nTRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder. He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them. \nJake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch down. Dream-like, surreal beauty. \nWIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror- like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL. \nJake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk. \nJAKE What's your name? \nJAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at him, spinning end for end and -- \nSHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below. \nJAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as -- \nSEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales. \nWe see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses' long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons. \nThe riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake turns to bolt, but -- \nNA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed -- blocking his retreat. \nNeytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi -- \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my captive! \nTSU'TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings off his mount with fluid grace. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) These demons are forbidden here. I will kill this one as a lesson to the others! \nTsu'tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake, confronting him warrior to warrior. \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik. \nTsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) Bring him. \nThey grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey and the others ride ahead. CUT TO: \nEXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT \nJAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250 meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars. \nTSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree, shouting an ululating WARNING. \nJake is force-marched through the pillars into -- \nINT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT \nAn open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe -- mothers with babies, old women, young hunters. \nThey gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow him. \nJake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery -- a living cathedral. \nClear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting. \nThe central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM. Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is -- \nEYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS. His normally stern features are clouded further by anger. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Why do you bring this creature here? \nNeytiri addresses Eytukan in Na'vi. \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa. \nHe glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake. \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! His alien smell fills my nose \nNeytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not submissive tone. \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) Father, many atokirina came to this alien. \nJAKE What's going on? \nNEYTIRI My father is deciding whether to kill you. \nJAKE Your father!? (to Eytukan) Uh, good to meet you, sir. \nJake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as -- \nA commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber. \nMO'AT (NA'VI) Step back! \nEverybody looks up. \nMO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down. She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) I will look at this alien. \nThere is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase. \nNEYTIRI That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one who interprets the will of Eywa. \n", "test1_id": 2469, "test2_input": "JAKE Who's Eywa? \nNeytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes. \nThe villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue. \nMO'AT (thick accent) What are you called? \nJAKE Jake Sully. \nShe produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a flourish she strikes his chest. \nJake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. She tastes it. \nMO'AT Why did you come to us? \nJAKE I came to learn. \nMO'AT We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. \nJAKE My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist. \nMO'AT What are you? \nJAKE I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) A warrior! I could kill him easily! \nEYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him. \nJAKE What's going on?   What are they saying? \nMO'AT (to Neytiri, subtitled) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do. \nNEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry. \nNEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) Why me? That's not fair!     I only-- \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) It is decided! \nNeytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake. \nMO'AT (to Jake) My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured. \nShe turns to Neytiri, her expression stern -- \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) He is your responsibility. \nNeytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.   She grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away. \nJAKE So it's all good, right?   You and me -- \nNEYTIRI Do not speak. CUT TO: \nINT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE \nLATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL. He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound with plant-fiber bandages. \nTHE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the circle. \nJAKE Don't get up. \nNeytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY. \nJAKE You never told me your name. \nNEYTIRI Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite. \nJAKE Okay, again, a whole lot slower. \nNEYTIRI (exaggerated slowness) Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree. \nJake knows she's baiting him.   He smiles in response. \nJAKE Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree. \nACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together, glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger. \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) These aliens try to look like people, but they can't. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too small. \nNEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving leaves onto his own leaf. \nJAKE Your mom likes me.    I can tell. \nMO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan. \nMO'AT (SUBTITLED) Neytiri will test this \"warrior.\" Hey may learn nothing -- but we will learn much. \nEYTUKAN You speak truth. We must understand these Sky People if we are to drive them out. \nJake munches on a white shrimp-like thing. \nJAKE These rock. What are they? \nNEYTIRI Teylu. You call beetle larvae. \nJake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and starts munching enthusiastically. \nJAKE That's some damn fine teylu. That's like grandma's teylu. \nCU TSU'TEY, warily eyeing Jake -- \nTSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) I say she will kill him. CUT TO: \nINT. THIRD LEVEL - NIGHT \nThe sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell. \nJake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl. She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes. \nJake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night- light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads through him. He closes his eyes and -- CUT TO: \nINT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "GRACE Come on back, kid, that's it. \nJAKE Wha --? Oh. \nHe looks around, blinking.   Reality crashing in. \nGRACE Damn, you were dug in like a tick. (she helps him sit up) Is the avatar safe? \nJAKE (huge grin) Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to believe where I am. CUT TO: \nINT. COMMISSARY - MORNING \nBREAKFAST the next day. The other drivers lean forward, hanging on Grace's re-telling of the tale. \nGRACE -- so the kid's out there one night and he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys. Unbelievable. \nJAKE It's not something you can teach. \nSome of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in congratulation. \nMAX That's awesome, Jake. \nNORM chomps his bacon, fuming. \nGRACE (to Jake, getting serious) For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all. CUT TO: \nINT. OPS CENTER - MORNING \nJAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral grin. \nQUARITCH Jarhead clan? (he laughs) And that worked? \nJAKE (GRINNING) Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I can learn to be one of them. \nQUARITCH That's how you seize the initiative. I wish I had ten more like you. \nSELFRIDGE Look, Sully -- find out what these blue monkeys want. (MORE) \nSELFRIDGE (cont'd) We try to give them medicine and education. Roads! But no -- they like mud. I wouldn't care except -- \nSelfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A road runs from Hell's Gate to a proposed new mine miles away. \nSELFRIDGE Their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction. Which sucks -- for them -- because they need to relocate. \nJAKE (taking that in) Does Augustine know about this? \nSELFRIDGE Yeah, she does, and she's on the next ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it. \nJAKE So -- who talks them into moving? \nQUARITCH (TURNING) Guess. \nJAKE What if they won't go? \nQUARITCH (ICY) I'm betting they will. \nSELFRIDGE Killing the indigenous looks bad, but there's one thing shareholders hate more than bad press -- and that's a bad quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to get them to move, or it's going to have to be all stick. \nJake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility. \nQUARITCH You got three months.    That's when the dozers get there. \nJAKE I'm on it. CUT TO: \nINT. BIO LAB - MORNING \nJAKE pumps his chair across the lab, flanked by GRACE and NORM. Grace holds STEREO STILL PICTURES in front of him, one at a time -- images of clan members she has shot over the years -- a kind of flash card drill. \nJAKE Tsu'tey. (next photo) Mo'at. (next photo) Eytukan. \nGRACE He's the clan leader -- (indicating Mo'at) -- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like a shaman. \nINT. LINK ROOM \nThe dialogue is continuous as they enter. \nJAKE Got it. So who's this Eywa? \nNORM Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The Great Mother. The goddess made up of all living things. You'd know that if you had any training whatsoever. \nHe hauls himself from wheelchair to Link. \nJAKE Who's got a date with the chief's daughter? \nGRACE Knock it off. Jesus, it's like kindergarten around here. \nAs Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace inputs commands at the control station. \nGRACE Neytiri was my best student. She and her sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls. \nJAKE I didn't meet the sister. \nGRACE (QUIETLY) No, she's dead. (turning to him) Okay, let's go -- village life starts early. \nMAX Link is ready. \nGrace lowers the bio-sensor array over Jake's chest. \nGRACE Don't do anything unusually stupid. \nShe closes the clamshell and we -- \nINT. HOMETREE/ THIRD LEVEL - DAY \nCU JAKE'S AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at -- \nHOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead.   Sunlight streams down through gaps in the towering vault. CUT TO: \nINT. COMMONS - DAY \nJAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily tasks. \n-- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING.    They look up as he passes, then go back to work. \n--two men clean the fish they've caught. \n", "test2_id": 2470, "test3_input": "NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow. \nBARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly. \nJAKE (V.O.) Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard. \nHUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see -- \nTRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads. \nJAKE (V.O.) Norm's attitude has improved lately. \nNORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. \nNORM Thank you? \nJAKE Ireiyo. \nNorm comically exaggerates the pronunciation. \nNORM Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it. \nNorm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a retard too. \nTRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark. \nJAKE (V.O.) My feet are getting tougher.   I can run farther every day. \nNeytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground. \nHe sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up. She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey. \nJAKE (V.O.) I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die. \nNeytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until -- \nShe catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. \nJAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush. \nHe drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive. \nNeytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived. \nTIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school. \nIN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows. Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi. \nJAKE (V.O.) I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning. \nGrace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting. \nGRACE (Na'vi, subtitled) I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite. \nNEYTIRI I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine. \nANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air. \nJAKE (V.O.) I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds. \nJAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as -- \nA HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs. \nOne of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. \nJake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau. \nANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are closed. She speaks very softly to Jake -- \nNEYTIRI When you hear nothing, you will hear everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything. \nJAKE (V.O.) Sometimes I have no idea what she's talking about. \nJake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature. \nJake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery. \nJAKE (V.O.) It's been a month and I'm still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn't given permission. \nOMIITED \nNEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.   She points and he parts some leaves to see -- \nA MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs. She licks their faces. \nJAKE (V.O.) There's a lot of crap like that. She's always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not -- \nVIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.    He's changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale. \nJAKE (SMIRKING) I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final. \nVisible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples. \nGRACE (without looking up) This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes. \nJAKE Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay? \nNEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits. \nCU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources. \nNIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool. \nA large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP! Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly. \nANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. \nAware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly. \nNIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns. Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond. As he approaches -- \nSNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. \n", "test3_true": "Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight. \nGrinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying. And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him. \nINSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light. \nJAKE (V.O.) Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream. \nTIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies. \nJAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife. \nHe speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi. \nJAKE (NA'VI) I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. \nNEYTIRI watches with approval. \nNEYTIRI A clean kill. You are ready. CUT TO: \nINT. SHACK - NIGHT \nLying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.   Norm helps Grace get him to his chair. \nGRACE You're still losing weight.   Here -- \nShe hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien food. Bites into it without enthusiasm. \nJAKE I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know where that meal came from. \nGRACE Other body. You need to take care of this body. \nJAKE Yeah yeah. \nGRACE Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap. You're burning too hard. \nJake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out. \nJAKE Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me. \nGRACE I'm telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time. \nJAKE Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. \nGRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee. \nGRACE Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying. \nJAKE That's right, Grace. This is what I've been working for. \nGRACE And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. You're getting in way too deep. (she turns away) Trust me, I learned the hard way. \nJake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation. \nJAKE What did happen at the school? \nGRACE looks up from making coffee.   Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children.   Finally -- \nGRACE Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting. \nGRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste. \nGRACE One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them. \nGRACE'S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator. \nGRACE The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse. \nMACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING. \nGRACE They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the others. (MILDLY) I got most of the kids out, before they shot me. \nJAKE Jesus. \nGRACE Yeah. \nJake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it. \nGRACE A scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa'atenuk. Mother. (turning to him) That kind of pain reaches back through the link. \nGRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake. \nGRACE It's a job. Learn what you can -- but don't get attached. \nGRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes. \nGRACE It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't stop what's coming. CUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY \nTSU'TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who's riding well enough to keep up. The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon. \nJAKE (V.O.) Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. It's the test every young hunter has to pass. \nTSU'TEY signals a stop. \nUP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip. \nA hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds. \nThere is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at -- \nOne of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky. \nThe Hunters dismount. \nJAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear. \nJAKE We doin' this? \nJake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk. CUT TO: \nEXT. BEANSTALK - DAY \n200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree. \n", "test3_id": 2471}

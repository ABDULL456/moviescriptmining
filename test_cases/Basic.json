{"test1_input": "HARDY (CONT'D) knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns? He Dunbar nods. HARDY I was also his \" knife dummy\" . (to Osborne) See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day. Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar. HARDY Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I'd ask where West and the others are. Can we get to them? He looks to the floor. DUNBAR There's no need... HARDY They're dead, aren't they? Dunbar looks back up at Hardy. DUNBAR Yeah. INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING Styles lowers his head at this. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING HARDY You kill them? No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward. OSBORNE The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer- HARDY See, Ray, this is what we call \"good cop, bad cop\". (MORE) \nHARDY She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established. Osborne, stunned by this. HARDY But I don't want to play games. That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors - everyone knows those things are two way, right? Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly. HARDY Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay? DUNBAR Okay. Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves. INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits. OSBORNE Baseball? HARDY Believe somebody owes me ten dollars- OSBORNE You made me look like an idiot- HARDY Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop - by admitting it I appeared trustworthy. STYLES You think he did it? OSBORNE No- HARDY Yes- They stop, looking at each other. \nSTYLES You've got four hours and forty-five minutes to find out. \nINT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING \nHardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him. \nHARDY Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray? \nDUNBAR I'm not telling you what happened. \nHARDY Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes a deep breath. \n", "test1_true": "HARDY Tell me about them. \nAs Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK... \nEXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO \nRow upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at attention. Their first day of boot camp. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge hated him from the beginning. \nA man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines. \nTwo ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST. \nWEST You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me - give me a sir, yes, sir! \n", "test1_id": 2070, "test2_input": "THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! \nWEST Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident - Give me a sir, yes, sir! THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! WEST In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand - Give me a sir, yes, sir! THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! WEST So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military - you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand! He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE. WEST My power here is absolute, isn't that right, nigger? PIKE Sir, yes, sir! West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face! WEST I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that? PIKE Sir, no, sir! West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself... \nWEST What the fuck is this? You lay a hand on me while I'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you? He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming. WEST Get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up! Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes. WEST What the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off! Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off. WEST Get those fucking pants off, I want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army issue clothes! Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED. West turns and spies Dunbar in the line. WEST Cadet, what's your name! DUNBAR Sir, Dunbar, sir! WEST You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar? DUNBAR Sir, yes, sir! West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him. WEST Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear? DUNBAR Sir, yes, sir! \nWEST The rest of you, fallout for physicals! The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike. One with a gun, the other naked. DUNBAR (V.O.) Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not Pike. EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD. DUNBAR (V.O.) Time went on and the Sarge started singling people out. One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol. EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him. DUNBAR He'd zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit. EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit. EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS. DUNBAR (V.O.) Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in what he called Section Eight. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike, Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks. DUNBAR (V.O.) Washout rejects, guys he said were , \"dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead\". He separated us from the rest. We slept alone... \nINT. MESS HALL -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The same four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members of the Cadet Corps chow at tables. DUNBAR (V.O.) . . .ate alone.. . EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep. DUNBAR ( V. O . ) ...and trained long after the other guys got to turn in. EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the \"dead one\"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it. DUNBAR (V.O.) Fellas lived in daily fear of being Sectioned and with good reason, too. West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters. DUNBAR They figured we were the boys who'd meet with a \"training accident\" . Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY Osborne leans forward. OSBORNE Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you? DUNBAR No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class. HARDY That's not exactly true... (off their looks) I'm living proof. How did you get Sectioned, Ray? \nDunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile. DUNBAR That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. OSBORNE Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out. DUNBAR There were six of us... EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw. DUNBAR (V.O.) Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. One of those \"his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun\" . He idolized West. Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace. Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild. DUNBAR (V.O.) And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog. He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him. Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes. DUNBAR (V.O.) But Childs did. Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near. Behind Childs runs Pike. DUNBAR (V.O.) Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. (MORE) \nDUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice. Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing. DUNBAR Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but... Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet. DUNBAR (V.O.) He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy? OSBORNE (V.O.) Epilepsy. DUNBAR (V.O.) Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY HARDY And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you? DUN BAR Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying. Hardy leans back in his chair. HARDY You smoke, Ray? DUNBAR This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more. HARDY No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some. Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table. HARDY My brand.   Must be my lucky day. \nHe takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same. HARDY Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you? Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in. M. P. Sirs? INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- MORNING Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them. HARDY He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him- STYLES He can wait.     Kendall's out of surgery. EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital. They sit in silence until: HARDY Why'd you join the army? Osborne looks at him, annoyed. OSBORNE You really want to make banal chit- Chat like that now? HARDY You're right. We should sit in silence. OSBORNE We're in the middle of a murder case- HARDY Best time for banal chit-chat. He slips something into his pocket. OSBORNE What is that? \n", "test2_true": "HARDY I plan to grow on you. OSBORNE You're off to a late start. HARDY So noted. They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER. HARDY You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here. OSBORNE Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar? HARDY He's telling the truth, up to a point. OSBORNE What point? Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS. OSBORNE Something wrong? HARDY Being back here. Gives me the willies. OSBORNE Not the happiest of memories? FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets, Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM. BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off. HARDY No. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- RECOVERY UNIT -- DAY A NURSE leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall. NURSE Normally we wouldn't let anyone see him this soon, but Colonel Styles said it was urgent- \nHARDY It is. OSBORNE Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. HARDY Got it. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm.   He is awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors. KENDALL You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... (POINTING TO HARDY) You're not Army, are you? HARDY Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk. Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy. KENDALL That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer- HARDY Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room.  I suggest you talk to us. Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool. KENDALL I've done nothing wrong. (gestures to his wound) I'm the victim here. HARDY But not the only victim, right? KENDALL My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me. \nOSBORNE We just want- KENDALL What, \"The Truth\"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem. Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave. HARDY It's too early in the day for me to give a shit about some pissant cadet's bad version of \"intrigue\". You want to talk to us, send word over to the brig. Let's go. Nonplussed, Osborne follows.    Hardy turns back at the door. HARDY You're working too hard, Levi. I can tell cause you're sweating. And you're sweating cause you have no idea what Dunbar's already told us. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDORS -- DAY Hardy and Osborne walk to the NURSE'S STATION. OSBORNE That was kid gloves? HARDY Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight. He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. OSBORNE But we have to question him- (noticing) Thought you didn't have cigarettes- HARDY I lied.   Wait for it... Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next. The PHONE at the Nurse's Station rings and a NURSE answers. Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them. NURSE Cadet Kendall- HARDY We're on our way. \nINT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY Hardy and Osborne sit across from Kendall's bed. HARDY Sergeant West is dead isn't he? Kendall nods. HARDY And the other three Cadets? Kendall hesitates, then nods again. HARDY Feel free to elaborate . Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone. KENDALL My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. (deep breath) I am a homosexual. HARDY Senator Daddy must be thrilled. KENDALL He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that? HARDY I think you just blew \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" out of the fucking water. KENDALL The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay. OSBORNE He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own. KENDALL He wanted more than that. \nHARDY More intrigue, Levi? \nKendall stares at them, dead serious. \nKENDALL Yes. \nINT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 2071, "test3_input": "HARDY No death certificates.    No crime. \nDUNBAR Just four people MIA.    Silence. \nThe JAG Lawyer steps forward. \nJAG LAWYER You'll testify to this, the corruption, the drug scam? \nDunbar says nothing. \nJAG LAWYER We can cut a deal for you on the Nunez killing. \nDUNBAR I don't want any deals. \nJAG LAWYER If you're telling the truth, the PX requisition records will prove it- DUNBAR All the proof you need will be when West comes back and puts a bullet in my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a dead man, anyway. Like Kendall. (looking at Hardy) We both should have died out there with our brothers. I know that now. Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone. JAG LAWYER I'll take him now if you don't mind. Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door. Turning back to Hardy. DUNBAR Tell me, detective.   Did you get what you wanted? Hardy shakes his head, sadly. HARDY Not even close. They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy. STYLES Tom- Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods, understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him. Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done. INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform. Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic. OSBORNE We need to talk- HARDY Seven. He takes a slug of his drink. OSBORNE What? \n", "test3_true": "OSBORNE You're a good man, Hardy. HARDY Really. OSBORNE Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past. Hardy stares at her. HARDY I may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me. He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne takes his hand, stopping him. OSBORNE And because you're a good man, I know you'll do the right thing. Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath. OSBORNE Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody took him off the plane before it left. My guess is he's already dead. Hardy stares at her. HARDY West? OSBORNE Nobody saw.    But I don't think so. She puts the papers on the bar. OSBORNE These are the requisitions from the PX, the ones used to release the drugs to Mueller. West signed half of them - Pike was telling the truth. Look who signed the other half. She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to believe it. He looks up at her, pained. HARDY Do I have a choice in this? OSBORNE Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself. \nHardy stares at his glass.   Deciding. HARDY Fuck it.   Let's go finish this. INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway. HARDY \"You have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs\". That was good. Styles squints at the figure. STYLES Tom, is that you? Hardy steps forward, into the office. HARDY It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you? STYLES What are you talking about? HARDY If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you. STYLES You're drunk- HARDY I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this. Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about. STYLES Look- He begins to move from behind his desk. \nHARDY Stay where you are. \nSTYLES Or what?   You've gone round the bend- \nHARDY West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done. \nHardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk. \nHARDY What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too. \nSTYLES That's preposterous- \n", "test3_id": 2072}

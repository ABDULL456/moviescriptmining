{"test1_input": "CYNTHIA Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better off right there. I don't think you'd even feel it. \nCynthia enters the building next to the alley. \nCUT TO: \nCYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nasleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close. Cynthia wakes. \nCYNTHIA Who is it? \nDivinci crosses to the bed. \nDIVINCI Got your money. \nCYNTHIA Put it on the table. \nShe closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. \nDIVINCI Tired? \nCYNTHIA Yes. \nDIVINCI I'm not. \nCYNTHIA Take a sleeping pill. There's some in my purse. \nDIVINCI You want your money? \nCynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling, holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nCYNTHIA I already worked for that. \nDivinci unzips his pants. \nDIVINCI This is a bonus. \nCYNTHIA For who? \nDivinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts to undress. \nDIVINCI This ain't my fault. This is a failure of our educational system. If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now. \nCYNTHIA So what's your excuse? \nDIVINCI I'm in love. \nCynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles Divinci's pants. \nCUT TO: \nKEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT \nA door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed with. \nVIC Keepin' some late hours. \nRodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme. \nRODRIGUEZ What the hell you doin'? What're my neighbors gonna think? \nVIC I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions? \nRODRIGUEZ I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do. \nVIC Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit. \nRodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one. \nVIC All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable? \nRodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings. \nRODRIGUEZ Four thousand is all I got. \nVIC I am proportionally reassured. You purchased yourself an extension. \nVic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez. \nRODRIGUEZ Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that? \nCUTLESS SUPREME It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back seat. \nRodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door. \nCUT TO: \nCREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE \nCRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime scenes. And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE. The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR -- \nYELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE \nsurrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area. \n", "test1_true": "PATROLMAN MAHONEY Another day, another body. Where you wanna start? \nFIRST MAN A hit? \nPATROLMAN MAHONEY Looks like. Could be gang related. \nAnd now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's DIVINCI and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own the area. And they do. \nPATROLMAN MAHONEY Happened sometime last night, early morning, two, three o'clock. African- American male, looks like in his thirties. But even that's a guess. Half his head is on the upholstery. \nRODRIGUEZ Any witnesses? \nPATROLMAN MAHONEY Oh, sure, hundreds. \nINT. CADILLAC - DAY \nThe bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it fell, on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in. \nDIVINCI Fuckin' Animals. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nEVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK OFFICER checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight, wears glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in evidence as Divinci walks in. \nFIRST DETECTIVE ...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge. \nThe Desk Officer checks in the evidence. \nDESK OFFICER Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge. \nThe two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches. \nSECOND DETECTIVE (SGT. GARDNER) Heard you got a gang related. Lucky guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty ones. \nDIVINCI One less drug store on the street. \nDESK OFFICER And the world is a safer place. \nThe Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door. Divinci crosses to the -- \nEVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM \n-- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-going investigations. And the shelves are full of guns, knives, bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc. \nDivinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on one of the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the .44 which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of the handle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nDesks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE DETECTIVES. Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the phone at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he fills out one of the many forms that complicate his life. \nRODRIGUEZ (into phone) -- a green car... you know what make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You didn't see the license, did you? \nDivinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez. Rodriguez looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes his hands together -- clean hands. \nRODRIGUEZ (into phone) Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark... Uh-huh. \nDivinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for a 42 FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up to Rodriguez, points to the boat. \nDIVINCI Wanna go for a ride? \nRODRIGUEZ (into phone) You think you could describe the driver? (covers phone; to Divinci) You bought it? \nDIVINCI As of last night, I've got the down. Just picture me under swayin' palms with a Mai Tai. \nWe can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone, but Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat. \nRODRIGUEZ (into phone) Uh-huh. (covers phone) You're gonna buy it, no shit. When? \nDIVINCI Just a phone call away. \nDivinci picks up the phone, starts to dial. \nRODRIGUEZ That's really great, man. \nDivinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on the other end of the phone has stopped talking. \nRODRIGUEZ (back to phone) Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he? \nA heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN HENDERSON. \nCAPT. HENDERSON You got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th. \nDIVINCI I'm workin' it up now. \nCAPT. HENDERSON Who's your second? (Divinci points at Rodriguez) In my office. Both of you. \nDIVINCI Why? \nCAPT. HENDERSON Now. \nCaptain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for the office -- an inner office of glass and wood. \n", "test1_id": 1377, "test2_input": "Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them. \nRODRIGUEZ What the hell -- \nDivinci motions \"keep calm.\" \nINT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY \nHenderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS, thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting. \nCAPT. HENDERSON Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms. He's with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some questions about your case. \nDIVINCI What's the occasion? \nSIMMS You get an i.d. on the victim? \nRODRIGUEZ We're waitin' for prints. \nDivinci pulls out his note pad. \nDIVINCI Car was registered to -- \nSIMMS -- Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. Black. \nDIVINCI If you got all this, what d'you want from us? \nSIMMS ...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd. \nRODRIGUEZ (a little incensed) How d'you know that? (to Henderson) What's goin' on here? \nSIMMS Hudd was DEA, undercover. \nRodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On their frozen expressions we HEAR -- \nSIMMS (O.S.) He was workin' a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side. But every dealer we tagged kept getting killed. He finally got a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend of mine... I'm gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him. \nA long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then -- \nDIVINCI We'll do everything we can to help. \nCUT TO: \nTHE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY \nscreeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT. The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his mind. \nDivinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired up and scared he can't stop moving. \nRODRIGUEZ SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST! \nDIVINCI Calm down! \nRODRIGUEZ WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD! \nDIVINCI SHUT UP! \nRODRIGUEZ FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! \nDivinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing about. \nDIVINCI STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! \nRODRIGUEZ GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL! \nRodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on. They struggle -- \nRODRIGUEZ LET GO OF ME! \n-- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez mouth. \nDIVINCI Shut up and listen to me! \nRodriguez glares up at Divinci. \nDIVINCI They could be watchin' us right now you asshole. So fuckin' shape up! You got it?! (nothing from Rodriguez) I want you to nod! \nIt takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt. \nDIVINCI Get the fuck up! \nRodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks him up. Pushes him to the car. \nDIVINCI Get in the car! \nThey move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side. Gets in, slams the door shut. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY \nThey sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat -- \nDIVINCI There's no fuckin' reason to panic. \nRodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously. \nRODRIGUEZ No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you say no fuckin' reason to panic! \n", "test2_true": "RODRIGUEZ WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS! \nDIVINCI Since when does that matter?! \nRodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY \nRodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey. \nDIVINCI All they want is someone to go down for the crime, right? Do we care who goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As long as someone goes down for the crime. It's a slot that's gotta be filled. \nRodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him -- \nRODRIGUEZ We killed a cop, doesn't that bother you? \nDIVINCI Of course it bothers me. What d'you want me to do, turn myself in? Well I'm not. That's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. So he got popped. It happens. \nRODRIGUEZ Not by other cops! \nDIVINCI I patted him down! He wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was I supposed to know?! \nA moment of silence, then -- \nDIVINCI Look, I feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here. The important thing is we don't lose control of the case. We can never lose control of the case. Whatever evidence there is goes through us. We lay down the trail. Make it nice and logical. We're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom. \nRODRIGUEZ What're you talkin' about, are you sayin' we stick somebody with this? \nDIVINCI Evidence points wherever we want it to point. Shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin' killed him. \nRODRIGUEZ You got some asshole in mind? \nDIVINCI Just don't worry. We'll find a killer. There's lots of 'em out there. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTHREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic. They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter. \nThe UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns the car and gives chase on wheels. \nJames darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him. \nRodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them. \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME \nJames darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to catch him. \nJames is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James. \nNo where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is disgusted. \nJAMES What the hell'd I do now? \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM - DAY \nDivinci removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from the shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087. \nCUT TO: \nTHE .44 - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nSLIDING across a table to James, who stops it with his right hand. Divinci and Rodriguez are across from him. \nJAMES Ain't my gun. \nDIVINCI Never is, is it. \nJAMES That ain't my fuckin' gun. \nHe shoves the gun back. Divinci stops it with his arm, careful not to touch it. \nDIVINCI Got your fuckin' prints on it. \nJames quickly realizes what they've done. He lunges for the gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through the trigger guard. James glares at them with murderous intent. \nRODRIGUEZ Where were you Friday night? \nJAMES Friday night... last Friday night? \nRODRIGUEZ Where were you? \nJAMES Whatever you think I did went down last Friday night? \nDIVINCI Better have a good alibi, James, or it's good ali bye-bye. \nA beat, then James smiles. \nJAMES I was in jail you assholes. Check it out. (starts to laugh) All night. What a couple a dickheads! \n", "test2_id": 1378, "test3_input": "Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, returning to their car parked curbside. \nDIVINCI He didn't have backup. You believe that?! Jesus what a dick. \nRODRIGUEZ I don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his. \nDIVINCI I don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy. You're just askin' for it. That's all I'm sayin'. \nRODRIGUEZ I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it! \nDIVINCI Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find? \nRODRIGUEZ That's what I'm afraid of. There's nothing for them to find. We were too good. \nDIVINCI So what're you worried about? \nRODRIGUEZ Nobody is that fuckin' good. \nDivinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles. \nDIVINCI Except us. \nCUT TO: \nSTRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT \nbumping and grinding her way through her performance. We don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative. The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer -- it's CYNTHIA. \nINT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT \nCynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels. She enters the dressing room. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nDivinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she sees him, then shuts the door. \nCYNTHIA I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it? \nDIVINCI I work homicide, I don't deal with that shit. \nCYNTHIA (puts on robe) Learn anything you didn't already have on file? \nDIVINCI Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of gold. (holds up her drivers license) You're an organ donor. That's really nice. The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts. \nCYNTHIA I'll make sure you get them. \nDIVINCI Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just surprised that we had something in common... Besides what we have in common. \nCYNTHIA Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats. \nDIVINCI Cynthia... pretty name. What do the first three letters spell? \nCYNTHIA Don't get so clever. It's out of character. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDivinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling. \nCYNTHIA What's so interesting up there? \nDIVINCI Nothing. \nCYNTHIA Then why's it got all your attention? \nDIVINCI I'm thinkin', that's all. \nCYNTHIA About us? \nDIVINCI No. \nCYNTHIA Good. \nDivinci looks at Cynthia. \nDIVINCI What if I was thinkin' about us? \nCYNTHIA Don't waste your time. \nDIVINCI What if I was? \nCYNTHIA Where's it gonna get us? \nDIVINCI Maybe I got plans. \nCYNTHIA I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. I'm fine now. I don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen. \nDIVINCI I just want you to know, love is important to me. \nCYNTHIA Me, too. \nDIVINCI But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life. \nCynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's actually, despite herself, a little touched. \n", "test3_true": "DIVINCI When you asked if I was thinkin' about us and I said I wasn't, I just want you to know that I do. \nA beat, then -- \nCYNTHIA Just don't ask me to marry you. \nDIVINCI (smiles) Why aren't more women like you? \nDivinci leans in and they kiss. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nDivinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol. \nA drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun in his hand. \nDivinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when -- \nTHE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun. \nDIVINCI (lowers gun) You fuckin' idiot. \nThe drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now we recognize Joe. \nDivinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nJoe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light with an arm. \nWe HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's JACKET POCKET. \nDIVINCI What've we got here? \nHe pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe. \nDIVINCI Where were you last Friday night? \nConfused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) \nDivinci drives. Joe up front. In an alcoholic daze. \nDIVINCI'S VOICE What's your name? \nJoe looks at Divinci. Having trouble focusing. \nDIVINCI Your name, what's your name? \nWILLIAM ...Joe... \nDIVINCI Where'd you get the gun, Joe? \nJoe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44. \nDIVINCI It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat pocket. You must keep it for protection, right? \nWILLIAM I don't know. \nDIVINCI Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs protection. Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right? \nJoe just stares at the gun. \nDIVINCI Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don't have to worry about me, I'm not gonna hurt you. \nJoe puts the gun into his jacket pocket. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING \nThe LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty. Quiet. Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died. \nINT. DIVINCI'S CAR - EARLY MORNING \nJoe is asleep, leaning against the window. Divinci reaches across and yanks him. \nDIVINCI Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window. \nJoe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window. \nDIVINCI This is where it happened, Joe. I want you to remember it. This is where you killed him \nJoe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head. \nDIVINCI You remember it now? How you shot him through the head? You remember it? \nWILLIAM I... don't... \nDIVINCI (lets go of Joe) You will. \n", "test3_id": 1379}

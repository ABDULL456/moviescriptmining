{"train": "\"GANG RELATED\" \nWritten by \nJim Kouf \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nNEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT \nThe N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking lot. Then the curtain closes. \nINT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT \nPeeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in his late thirties. Slightly nervous. \nAnother man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI. \nDIVINCI Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 325 a month. Utilities included. That's not bad. \nRodriguez sits down. \nDIVINCI But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it. \nRodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks up. \nRODRIGUEZ I don't know how you do it. \nDIVINCI What? \nRODRIGUEZ How you can think about Hawaii now? \nDIVINCI My heart's in Hawaii. \nRODRIGUEZ You never been there. How can your heart be there. \nDIVINCI You're tellin' me there's no place you'd rather be other than here? \nRODRIGUEZ No, I'm saying I just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right now. \nDIVINCI If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference? \nRODRIGUEZ No. \nDIVINCI Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here. \nRODRIGUEZ But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking. \nDIVINCI Focus. \nRODRIGUEZ Focus. \nDivinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch. \nRODRIGUEZ It's time. No more Hawaii, okay? Focus on this. \nDIVINCI (smiles) Aloha. \nRodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits. \nRODRIGUEZ (to himself) Aloha my ass. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT \nPoor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nLIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life. \nShe glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg. \nCYNTHIA Left at the corner. \nHudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy bass. \nEXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, leads him to SEVEN. Knocks. \nThe curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens. \nCynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT \nDivinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one has followed, then shuts the door. \nDIVINCI Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons. \nHUDD Hell yes I mind. \nCYNTHIA Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better off right there. I don't think you'd even feel it. \nCynthia enters the building next to the alley. \nCUT TO: \nCYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nasleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close. Cynthia wakes. \nCYNTHIA Who is it? \nDivinci crosses to the bed. \nDIVINCI Got your money. \nCYNTHIA Put it on the table. \nShe closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. \nDIVINCI Tired? \nCYNTHIA Yes. \nDIVINCI I'm not. \nCYNTHIA Take a sleeping pill. There's some in my purse. \nDIVINCI You want your money? \nCynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling, holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nCYNTHIA I already worked for that. \nDivinci unzips his pants. \nDIVINCI This is a bonus. \nCYNTHIA For who? \nDivinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts to undress. \nDIVINCI This ain't my fault. This is a failure of our educational system. If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now. \nCYNTHIA So what's your excuse? \nDIVINCI I'm in love. \nCynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles Divinci's pants. \nCUT TO: \nKEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT \nA door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed with. \nVIC Keepin' some late hours. \nRodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme. \nRODRIGUEZ What the hell you doin'? What're my neighbors gonna think? \nVIC I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions? \nRODRIGUEZ I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do. \nVIC Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit. \nRodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one. \nVIC All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable? \nRodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings. \nRODRIGUEZ Four thousand is all I got. \nVIC I am proportionally reassured. You purchased yourself an extension. \nVic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez. \nRODRIGUEZ Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that? \nCUTLESS SUPREME It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back seat. \nRodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door. \nCUT TO: \nCREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE \nCRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime scenes. And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE. The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR -- \nYELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE \nsurrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area. \nDivinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them. \nRODRIGUEZ What the hell -- \nDivinci motions \"keep calm.\" \nINT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY \nHenderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS, thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting. \nCAPT. HENDERSON Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms. He's with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some questions about your case. \nDIVINCI What's the occasion? \nSIMMS You get an i.d. on the victim? \nRODRIGUEZ We're waitin' for prints. \nDivinci pulls out his note pad. \nDIVINCI Car was registered to -- \nSIMMS -- Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. Black. \nDIVINCI If you got all this, what d'you want from us? \nSIMMS ...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd. \nRODRIGUEZ (a little incensed) How d'you know that? (to Henderson) What's goin' on here? \nSIMMS Hudd was DEA, undercover. \nRodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On their frozen expressions we HEAR -- \nSIMMS (O.S.) He was workin' a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side. But every dealer we tagged kept getting killed. He finally got a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend of mine... I'm gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him. \nA long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then -- \nDIVINCI We'll do everything we can to help. \nCUT TO: \nTHE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY \nscreeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT. The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his mind. \nDivinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired up and scared he can't stop moving. \nRODRIGUEZ SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST! \nDIVINCI Calm down! \nRODRIGUEZ WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD! \nDIVINCI SHUT UP! \nRODRIGUEZ FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! \nDivinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing about. \nDIVINCI STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! \nRODRIGUEZ GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL! \nRodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on. They struggle -- \nRODRIGUEZ LET GO OF ME! \n-- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez mouth. \nDIVINCI Shut up and listen to me! \nRodriguez glares up at Divinci. \nDIVINCI They could be watchin' us right now you asshole. So fuckin' shape up! You got it?! (nothing from Rodriguez) I want you to nod! \nIt takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt. \nDIVINCI Get the fuck up! \nRodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks him up. Pushes him to the car. \nDIVINCI Get in the car! \nThey move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side. Gets in, slams the door shut. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY \nThey sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat -- \nDIVINCI There's no fuckin' reason to panic. \nRodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously. \nRODRIGUEZ No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you say no fuckin' reason to panic! \nRodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, returning to their car parked curbside. \nDIVINCI He didn't have backup. You believe that?! Jesus what a dick. \nRODRIGUEZ I don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his. \nDIVINCI I don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy. You're just askin' for it. That's all I'm sayin'. \nRODRIGUEZ I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it! \nDIVINCI Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find? \nRODRIGUEZ That's what I'm afraid of. There's nothing for them to find. We were too good. \nDIVINCI So what're you worried about? \nRODRIGUEZ Nobody is that fuckin' good. \nDivinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles. \nDIVINCI Except us. \nCUT TO: \nSTRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT \nbumping and grinding her way through her performance. We don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative. The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer -- it's CYNTHIA. \nINT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT \nCynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels. She enters the dressing room. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nDivinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she sees him, then shuts the door. \nCYNTHIA I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it? \nDIVINCI I work homicide, I don't deal with that shit. \nCYNTHIA (puts on robe) Learn anything you didn't already have on file? \nDIVINCI Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of gold. (holds up her drivers license) You're an organ donor. That's really nice. The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts. \nCYNTHIA I'll make sure you get them. \nDIVINCI Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just surprised that we had something in common... Besides what we have in common. \nCYNTHIA Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats. \nDIVINCI Cynthia... pretty name. What do the first three letters spell? \nCYNTHIA Don't get so clever. It's out of character. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDivinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling. \nCYNTHIA What's so interesting up there? \nDIVINCI Nothing. \nCYNTHIA Then why's it got all your attention? \nDIVINCI I'm thinkin', that's all. \nCYNTHIA About us? \nDIVINCI No. \nCYNTHIA Good. \nDivinci looks at Cynthia. \nDIVINCI What if I was thinkin' about us? \nCYNTHIA Don't waste your time. \nDIVINCI What if I was? \nCYNTHIA Where's it gonna get us? \nDIVINCI Maybe I got plans. \nCYNTHIA I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. I'm fine now. I don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen. \nDIVINCI I just want you to know, love is important to me. \nCYNTHIA Me, too. \nDIVINCI But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life. \nCynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's actually, despite herself, a little touched. \nDivinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and -- \nTHE CAR \n-- tears off down the street. \nCUT TO: \nRODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nasleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS. Rodriguez startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring. \nRODRIGUEZ Who the hell is this? \nINTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nDivinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on the bed in the b.g. The room is dark. \nDIVINCI Is that any way to answer the phone? \nRODRIGUEZ Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six. \nDIVINCI I know what time it is, I'm not the one in bed. I need the photos of the scene. \nRODRIGUEZ Now? \nDIVINCI I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand. \nRodriguez sits up in bed. \nRODRIGUEZ He doesn't remember last Friday? \nDIVINCI He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka. (glances at Joe) Make it two. \nCUT TO: \nJOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nasleep on the bed. \nDIVINCI Time to get up, Joe. \nDivinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open. \nDIVINCI I want you to look at something. \nThe room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez. He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position. \nDIVINCI There's the guy and the street and the car. You remember how you shot him. \nJoe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head. \nDIVINCI You don't remember? That's not what you told me last night. \nJoe is confused. \nDIVINCI If you remember you can have a drink. \nJoe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him. \nDIVINCI But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you? \nJoe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods. \nDIVINCI And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun? \nJoe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S FACE as we -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS \nHudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe. \nRODRIGUEZ Why'd you kill him? \nWILLIAM I... don't know... \nRODRIGUEZ It was your gun. \nWILLIAM ...I don't have a gun. \nDIVINCI Yes you do. In your pocket. \nWILLIAM ...I'm tired. \nDIVINCI I know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember. What about your last name, Joe. You got a last name? \nJoe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not to. \nRODRIGUEZ Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name. \nWILLIAM I don't remember. \nRODRIGUEZ Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn name? \nCYNTHIA He didn't do it. \nDIVINCI How the hell d'you know that? Were you with him at the time?! You have a good goddamn alibi for him?! \nRODRIGUEZ Maybe she was blowing him! \nCYNTHIA Better him than you. \nRodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall. Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching. \nDIVINCI Take it easy. \nRodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci. \nRODRIGUEZ Fine, I got nothin' at stake here. \nDivinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia. \nDIVINCI This is what they call an open and shut case. He did the kill and he's going down. Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do. \nDivinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat, then takes it and signs her name. \nCUT TO: \nJOE - CLOSE SHOT - MUG SHOTS \nholding a number. The SCENE FADES WHITE with the FLASH. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCELL DOOR - INT. JAIL - DAY \nclosing on Joe who is standing in the small CELL, facing the wall, his back to us. The door is locked and we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY \nas the .44 is placed on a shelf. But this time it's tagged with a different number. M5114000. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SIGNED CONFESSION - INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY \nas Agent Simms reads through it to the end. \nSIMMS Doe? \nSimms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are also present. The DEA are in suits and ties. \nRODRIGUEZ He wouldn't give us his last name. \nSIMMS He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name? \nDIVINCI He said he couldn't remember it. (points to his head) He's a head case. \nAGENT HOOPER You run prints? \nRODRIGUEZ No priors. \nAGENT SARKASIAN Ballistics match? \nRODRIGUEZ We're waiting. But a forty-four was used in commission. He had a forty- four on him. \nAGENT HOOPER It went down pretty quick. \nDIVINCI It's our street. \nCAPT. HENDERSON I think they did a helluva job. \nSuddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk. \nSIMMS Goddammit! \nEveryone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy. \nSIMMS Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for NOTHING! \nThe intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat as Simms regains his composure. \nSIMMS I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for this to happen... I just didn't think he'd go down this way. \nSimms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez. \nSIMMS Good work. Thanks. \nHe shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian follow their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson exchange a look. \nCAPT. HENDERSON Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes back in here. \nCUT TO: \nHEADLIGHTS (B&W) \ncoming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the screen. \nJUDGE WEINBERG The defense may now proceed. \nJohn Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense whisper. \nRICHARD STEIN -- Jesus Christ! \nYOUNG MAN -- I don't know where? \nRICHARD STEIN Are you sure? \nYOUNG MAN They looked all over -- \nHELEN What's wrong? \nRICHARD STEIN They can't find the murder weapon. \nHELEN What're you talking about? \nRICHARD STEIN Dunner's .44. They can't find the goddamn gun! \nYOUNG MAN They lost it or something. Misplaced it, I don't know. They can't find it anywhere. \nHELEN (no whisper this time) What?! \nA pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nRodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen. Helen is furious. \nHELEN -- I don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?! \nRodriguez and Divinci exchange a look. \nCUT TO: \nRODRIGUEZ AND DIVINCI - EXT. COURTROOM - DAY \nwalking quickly down the steps. \nRODRIGUEZ The Dunner gun, you used the fucking Dunner gun?! \nDIVINCI This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don't point your finger at me! \nRODRIGUEZ Alright, alright... But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?! \nDIVINCI We don't explain it. It's not our fault they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case. All we need is another gun. \nCUT TO: \nBRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY \nas it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS. \nTHE GUN SELLER All my merchandise is in top condition. Untraceable. The best money can buy. \nA BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a GLOVED HAND. His accent is British. \nTHE GUN SELLER It's got good knock down, but it's slow. Unless you have a preference for revolvers, I suggest a nine millimeter auto. They are more expensive, but what they cost in money, they save in time. \nRodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun. \nDIVINCI The .44. \nThe gun seller eyes them for a moment. \nRODRIGUEZ What? \nTHE GUN SELLER You look like police. \nDivinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles. \nTHE GUN SELLER No offense. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY \nas the NEW .44 goes onto the shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nElliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe into the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His hair is combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is a little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts the door, leaving them alone. \nELLIOT Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other... well, you weren't in very good shape. You look much better. \nJoe just stares at Elliot. \nELLIOT Have a chair. We need to talk. \nWILLIAM About what I did. \nHELEN And we would like to enter it into court records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol Beaman. \nThe .44 is duly entered into the records. \nCLYDE \nglances at \"his\" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS. It's a .44 all right. \nHELEN The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand. \nBAILIFF Steven J. Allen. \nSTEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, then sits. \nHELEN Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you do. \nSTEVEN J. ALLEN I am a lab technician for the police department. One of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes. \nClyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He looks at -- \nTHE .44 SMITH AND WESSON \n-- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on the handle. \nSTEVEN J. ALLEN I tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased. \nCLYDE That ain't my gun. \nAll attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement. \nJUDGE WEINBERG I must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when -- \nCLYDE That ain't my gun! \nThe Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast. \nCLYDE THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN! \nAnd Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the way. And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury is scared. \nCLYDE YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME! \nClyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose. \nCLYDE IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN! \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nDoor slams open. Rodriguez and Divinci enter. Rodriguez quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the door. They are alone. When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls -- \nRODRIGUEZ We gotta put the right gun back. \nDIVINCI We can't put the right gun back! Without that gun, they won't convict Joe. \nRODRIGUEZ Without that gun they won't convict Clyde! \nDIVINCI I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us! \nRODRIGUEZ Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right. He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry about. We can't let him go back on the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. He'll kill somebody again. \nDIVINCI Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! I don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' gun! \nRODRIGUEZ I don't think that's important right now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper work when Divinci and Rodriguez approach. Divinci knocks on the door. The desk officer looks up. He's had a tough day. \nDESK OFFICER Sorry, Divinci, can't do it. \nDIVINCI What d'you mean you can't do it? I gotta check something. \nDESK OFFICER You gotta get written permission from the Chief. \nRODRIGUEZ Since when?! \nDESK OFFICER Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage. \nDIVINCI What's the problem? \nDESK OFFICER Something about missing evidence or who the hell knows. I just wanna transfer the hell outa here. \nDIVINCI What the hell're we supposed to do?! \nDESK OFFICER Ask the chief. Policy ain't my department! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY \nJoe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening. \nHe takes her arm, leads her out of the station. \nINT. POLICE STATION PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nDivinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car. \nCYNTHIA I thought you said all I had to do was pick him out?! That's what you said, that's all I had to do. I did what you said. But that was supposed to be all. \nDIVINCI SHUT UP! \nHe opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind her. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nCynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger. \nDIVINCI What're you talkin' about? \nCynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena. \nCYNTHIA They want me in court. \nDivinci glances at the papers. \nCYNTHIA You promised me I wasn't gonna have to do anything! What the hell is goin' on?! \nThis is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on. \nCYNTHIA I can't do this, Frank. I can't go into court. I'm gettin' outa here! \nDIVINCI You are not getting outa here! \nCYNTHIA Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID I'D HAVE TO DO! \nDIVINCI WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND AND LET ME THINK! \nCynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and blows out the smoke. \nCYNTHIA Fine. Think away. \nDivinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns to her. \nDIVINCI Look, you're a witness, that's all. You got nothin' to worry about. You saw something happen -- \nCYNTHIA -- What?! What did I see?! \nDIVINCI I will tell you everything you gotta know. You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say. \nCynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all. Just like dancin'. \nTHE UNMARKED CAR \npulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL - MEETING ROOM - DAY \nElliot is waiting. The guard opens the door and Joe enters. Joe is looking better. Getting him off booze has helped immensely. \nELLIOT Hi, Joe. You're looking much better. \nWILLIAM I guess jail's been good for me. \nElliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair. \nELLIOT Trial date's been set for Thursday. \nWILLIAM I've been thinking about what I did... and I don't think it's right that I try getting off. \nELLIOT Excuse me? \nWILLIAM I want to plead guilty. I killed a man and I should be punished. \nELLIOT ...I'm a little surprised. \nWILLIAM Why? \nELLIOT Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions. \nWILLIAM But why was I carrying a gun? I had no right to carry a gun. \nELLIOT If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead. \nWILLIAM And he might be alive. \nELLIOT I understand... Can I think about this? \nWILLIAM No. I've made up my mind. \nElliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we -- \nCUT TO: \nYELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE - EXT.

How are you? \nWILLIAM Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like some coffee, juice. \nARTHUR No, I'm fine. \nWILLIAM Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. You certainly got my attention with your phone call. What's this all about? \nArthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it. Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the paper. \nWILLIAM Is there something you want me to see? \nArthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then -- \nWILLIAM Oh my God. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Pulls open the door and almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock. \nDIVINCI (startled) Jesus! \nRichard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment to recognize -- \nRICHARD STEIN Divinci? \nDivinci is caught off guard. \nRICHARD STEIN Richard Stein, D.A.'s office. \nDIVINCI Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect -- what're you doing here? \nRICHARD STEIN I have to talk with Cynthia Webb.

Is she there? \nDIVINCI No. \nRICHARD STEIN I was supposed to meet her at two. (looks at watch) Do you know her? \nDIVINCI What d'you mean? \nRICHARD STEIN Well, I just mean, if she's not here... you were... (a little awkward) ...inside. \nDIVINCI (forces a smile) Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she's a witness in a murder case. And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know. I like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' around. (pulls door shut) Don't tell on me. \nRICHARD STEIN No, no, of course not... Well, maybe I should wait. She might be stuck in traffic or something. \nDIVINCI Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. I'd like to talk to her, too. \nRICHARD STEIN Of course. \nDivinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and -- \nDIVINCI See you in court. \nRICHARD STEIN Right. \nDivinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his watch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY \nElliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock on the door. \nELLIOT Yeah. \nMANNY How long I got? \nDIVINCI Two days. \nMANNY Shit, two fuckin' days! \nDIVINCI Find her, puss head. \nDivinci glares at Manny, then exits.

Takes his place at the DEFENSE TABLE which includes Elliot and TWO YOUNG ATTORNEYS. The PROSECUTION TABLE, which includes Richard Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia. \nPEOPLE are taking seats in the gallery. But another attorney joins the Defense table. It's Arthur Baylor. And Richard Stein double-takes when he sees him. \nAT THE PROSECUTION TABLE \nRICHARD STEIN (to Helen) Isn't that Arthur Baylor? \nHelen turns. \nHELEN Yes. \nThey watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot, the two young attorneys and Joe. \nRICHARD STEIN What's he doing here? \nArthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across at Helen and Richard and nods. Helen and Richard are stunned. \nHELEN What the hell? \nBAILIFF Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands. The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding. \nEveryone rises as JUDGE HAROLD PINE enters. In black robe. Taking his place behind the bench.

And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes when he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table. \nBAILIFF The People versus Joe Doe in case number 95-24705. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Before we proceed, I'd like to ask the Defense if there's anything this court should be made aware of. \nArthur stands. \nARTHUR Yes, your honor. I have joined the defense in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall, otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe. \nEveryone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA PUSHES in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet. \nARTHUR I have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago. It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE How long do you need. \nARTHUR One week should be sufficient. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Any objection to a week's continuance by the State? \nHELEN I don't... believe so, your honor. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Then I grant a one week continuance. We will start the proceedings next Monday morning. \nJudge Harold Pine taps his gavel. \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION NEWS REPORTS - INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nFLASH Joe's photograph and scenes of him being lead from the courtroom. Helen and Richard Stein are watching. They can't believe it. \nNEWSCASTER -- when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years. The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall. Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and other related industries. The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY \nParked on the street. Rodriguez and Divinci inside. Rodriguez reads the paper. \nRODRIGUEZ -- but William McCall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969. Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor. \nRodriguez slams down the paper. \nRODRIGUEZ Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? A goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans?! \nDIVINCI He was living in the fuckin' street! How the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor?! \nRODRIGUEZ He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' murder on! \nDivinci grabs the paper away from him. Both cops are angry, upset, frustrated and scared to death. \nRODRIGUEZ When we pick 'em, we really fuckin' pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up the fuckin' Pope. \nDUNCAN I got one piece of advise. When you break for lunch, don't get the pastrami. \nWe HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open. \nGUARD Time to go. \nJoe gets up. Puts out his hands.

LARGE COURTROOM - DAY \nJoe is sitting at the Defense table with Arthur and Elliot. The trial is underway. And they watch the .44 go to the evidence table -- the .44 with the BLACK STAIN. \nRichard Stein is seated at the Defense table. He, too, is watching the .44. He leans across to his ASSISTANT. \nRICHARD STEIN All these goddamn guns are startin' to look the same to me. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDIVINCI - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER \non the stand, being questioned by Helen. \nHELEN And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd. \nDIVINCI No. \nHELEN Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest. \nDIVINCI He was drunk. We could smell the booze on him. But we drew blood. He didn't object. \nHELEN We have the blood test report that shows -- (picks up report) -- that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would like to enter this into evidence. \nThey so enter it. \nCUT TO: \nRODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER \non the stand. Elliot is cross-examining. \nELLIOT -- and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall? \nRODRIGUEZ You ask questions. Work the neighborhood. Find out who was on the street that night. \nELLIOT Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no previous criminal record. \nRODRIGUEZ We found someone who'd seen him in the area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn't expect it to be him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer. Just routine really. \nELLIOT Where did you find the defendant? \nRODRIGUEZ On the street. Corner of Third and Madison. \nELLIOT What was he doing? \nRODRIGUEZ He was passed out. \nELLIOT But you knew it was the man you were looking for. \nRODRIGUEZ Yes. \nELLIOT Based on what? \nRODRIGUEZ His description. \nELLIOT Who provided you with the description? \nRODRIGUEZ (hesitates a beat) Cynthia something, I think. \nElliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks at the paper. \nELLIOT I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up. The name familiar? \nBAILIFF You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God. \nShe turns her eyes from Joe. \nCYNTHIA Sure. \nBAILIFF You may be seated. \nCynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci. \nAnd Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their conversation is in whispers -- \nWILLIAM I know her. \nELLIOT She's the woman who identified you. \nWILLIAM No. I mean I know her. \nARTHUR ...How? \nWILLIAM I'm not sure... I think I lived near her. \nArthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now and looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning. \nHELEN Please state your name for the court. \nCYNTHIA Cynthia Webb. \nHELEN Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room. \nCYNTHIA Yes. \nHELEN Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall? \nCynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her. Cynthia turns her eyes away. \nCYNTHIA Yes. \nHELEN Please describe what you saw the night of September 14th. \nCYNTHIA I was comin' out of an all night minimart -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT \nCynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound. And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He has a pistol in one hand. \nCynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the darkness. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY \nCynthia is looking at Helen. \nHELEN And you're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant. \nInstead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her answer. \nCYNTHIA Yeah. \nHELEN No further questions. \nDivinci offers her a small smile. \nCynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her. \nARTHUR Miss Webb... is it Miss? \nCYNTHIA Yes. \nARTHUR Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us? \nCYNTHIA No. \nARTHUR Do you know what perjury is? \nCYNTHIA When you lie. \nARTHUR When you lie under oath in a court of law. Do you know what the penalty for that is? \nCYNTHIA You go to jail. \nARTHUR Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night? \nHELEN Objection. The witness has already answered that question. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Sustained. \nARTHUR I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else before the night in question. \nDivinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Ms. Webb, do you understand the consequences of perjury? \nARTHUR When you went home you saw Joe? \nCynthia realizes what she's said. \nCYNTHIA No. \nHELEN Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the witness. \nARTHUR I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb? \nArthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared. \nHELEN Objection! \nEveryone's attention is on Cynthia. \nARTHUR When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who I was talking about, didn't you. This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial. How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb? \nCynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen. Rodriguez is sweating. \nThen Cynthia turns and looks at Joe. \nJoe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her. \nARTHUR Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe was the defendant? \nCynthia lowers her eyes to the floor. \nCYNTHIA He lived in the alley next to my apartment building. \nHelen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again. \nHELEN (to herself) Oh shit. \nDivinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, calm and collected. \nARTHUR Why did you lie to this court? \nCYNTHIA I don't know. \nARTHUR Are you afraid of somebody? \nCYNTHIA I don't know. \nARTHUR Are you protecting somebody? \nCYNTHIA I don't know. \nJUDGE HAROLD PINE Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or I'll be forced to cite you for contempt. \nCynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking. \nCUT TO: \nCYNTHIA \nhaving her mug shots taken. Holding a number. On the FLASH -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - STREET - DAY \nDriving. \nRODRIGUEZ She didn't talk. \nDIVINCI Don't hold your breath. \nRODRIGUEZ You think she'll talk. \nDIVINCI I know she'll talk. \nRODRIGUEZ We'll make it look gang related. \nDIVINCI Problem is we're gonna need another gun. \nRODRIGUEZ The problem?! Have you forgotten? She's in fucking jail. That's the goddamn problem. \nDIVINCI Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life? You just get a fuckin' gun. \nEXT.

UNMARKED CAR - PARKED DOWN THE STREET - NIGHT \nDivinci and Rodriguez watch Cynthia get into the car with Manny. \nRODRIGUEZ This is the last time, Frank. The last time we kill somebody. \nDIVINCI Yeah, it's the last time. \nRODRIGUEZ This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is enough. \nDIVINCI I get the picture. \nDivinci looks at Rodriguez. He's staring out the window, but he looks ill. Something is not right with him. \nRODRIGUEZ It was all okay until you shot Hudd. \nDIVINCI What's goin' on here? You mad at me or something? \nRODRIGUEZ It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people. \nDIVINCI Drug dealers don't qualify as people. Never did, never will. So what the hell's wrong with you tonight? You suddenly worried about where all the money went? \nRODRIGUEZ I'm just sick of it, that's all. \nDivinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then starts car. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street and stops. The lights go out. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nRODRIGUEZ What're you doin'? \nDIVINCI I need some fresh air. \nDivinci exits. Rodriguez hesitates, then gets out with him. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nRODRIGUEZ Frank -- \nDIVINCI Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk to me. \nRodriguez hesitates a moment, then -- \nRODRIGUEZ I don't know... I owe some money. I don't know how I'm gonna pay it... \nDIVINCI You gambling again? \nRODRIGUEZ Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't... Frank... let's forget about this. Let's just get the fuck outa here. We got enough money, let's go. We'll get outa the country or something. \nDivinci turns toward Rodriguez. And he's got his pistol out. \nRODRIGUEZ What the hell're you doin'?! \nDIVINCI Take off your shirt. \nRODRIGUEZ What're you talkin' about? \nDIVINCI Just take off your shirt. If there's nothin' to worry about, then I'll apologize. But I'm not gonna argue. Take off your fuckin' shirt now. \nRODRIGUEZ What is this, you piece of shit?! You don't trust me?! Is that it?! YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?! \nDIVINCI ...Take off your shirt. \nRODRIGUEZ Fuck you, you don't trust me. \nDIVINCI I'm askin' you one more time. \nRODRIGUEZ You wanna shoot me? Shoot me. \nDivinci hesitates. He doesn't want to. This is his partner. A beat, then he lowers his gun. \nDIVINCI Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing... shit. Let's just get it over with. \nDivinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nDivinci starts up the car. \nDIVINCI I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the hook. \nRODRIGUEZ Right. \nDivinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER strapped to his body, recording their every word. \nDIVINCI YOU FUCKIN' RAT! \nDivinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez, bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank. \nRODRIGUEZ Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. \nAGENT HOOPER It was Divinci wasn't it? \nCYNTHIA I don't know. \nSIMMS Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci or Rodriguez? \nCYNTHIA I don't know. \nAgent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes. \nSIMMS Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was shot in the head last night. \nThis gets Cynthia's attention. \nSIMMS Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci found it. You can do addition, can't you. \nCYNTHIA You're full of shit. \nAGENT SARKASIAN Just tell us what you know. \nCynthia looks at both of them. \nCYNTHIA Where's Divinci? \nSIMMS We don't know. But we're gonna find him. \nCYNTHIA You're gonna find him? (smiles sarcastically) Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing. \nSimms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and nods. Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of the office. When the door closes -- \nSIMMS Get a copy of the tape to Bailor. But make sure it doesn't come from us. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY \nCynthia is alone in her cell. We HEAR footsteps. She looks up as the GUARD approaches. \nGUARD Your attorney's here. \nCYNTHIA What attorney? \nINT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY \nCynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door. Cynthia finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on the table in front of him. \nARTHUR Hi, Cynthia.

I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the hook. \nArthur watches Cynthia's reaction to \"when she's dead.\" But Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking. \nRODRIGUEZ'S VOICE Right. \nDIVINCI'S VOICE YOU FUCKIN' RAT! \nRODRIGUEZ'S VOICE Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE! \nDIVINCI'S VOICE You're fuckin' right. \nThe recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine. \nARTHUR I think you know my client is innocent. That's all I care about, my client. But I understand why you're scared. You're already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. But I don't really care, I'm not after you... I get nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my client. \nCYNTHIA ...how? \nARTHUR William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did he? \nCynthia hesitates, then shakes her head. \nARTHUR Why don't you sit down. \nA beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair. \nCUT TO: \nAGENT SIMMS - INT.

Tries the light. It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her -- \nMAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI) I guess you had no choice. \nCynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run. Desperate and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are filthy. He looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him. \nDIVINCI You had to do the right thing. \nCYNTHIA What d'you want? \nDIVINCI What do I want? \nDivinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room. \nDIVINCI Why're you asking me that? You gonna grant me three wishes? I don't know where to start. Let's see... money would be nice... love would be better... but a little loyalty... you can never get enough of that. (moves up to her) ...But we'll start with... money. \nDivinci pushes her into the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) \nCynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's got her savings. \nCYNTHIA This is all I've got. \nDivinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket. \nCYNTHIA They'll catch you. \nDIVINCI I don't think so. \nCYNTHIA You wanna bet? \nDIVINCI They don't have a clue, baby. And you wanna know why? Because I am following my heart. \nDivinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face. \nDIVINCI And they don't know where that is. \nCYNTHIA So tell me about your plans. I think I'd like to hear 'em now. \nDivinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse. \nDIVINCI Loyalty is what it all comes down to. Nothing holds together when it's gone. And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back... You shouldn't've told 'em. \nCYNTHIA I shouldn't've done a lotta things in my life. But that's not one of 'em. \nDIVINCI Let me tell you something... the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) \nIt is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside. And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM. Divinci exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR close. \nAND WHITE FEATHERS \nfall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

I wanna talk to a lawyer! \nJust want they wanted to hear. No alibi. \nRODRIGUEZ Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez.

Jewelry store on seventh and Front, about nine o'clock. Not even close to your jurisdiction. I got the rocks to prove it. \nHe drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table. \nDAVE Sorry I can't help ya. But one to five is better than ten to life. \nDivinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave.

HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY \nCaptain Henderson is sitting behind his desk. Divinci and Rodriguez are in front of him. Rodriguez is trying to hide his nervousness. Divinci is absolutely cool. \nDIVINCI This is our case! Not the goddamn DEA's! \nCAPT. HENDERSON It's been three days. \nDIVINCI We're not fuckin' magicians! What the hell is three days?! This is a goddamn murder case! It takes a little bit of goddamn time! \nCAPT. HENDERSON When a Federal Undercover Officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case! I don't like the DEA on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours. But this is personal for them and they want answers. Forget your other cases and get something, anything that I can give to them. The last thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I. on my back, too. \nDivinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then -- \nDIVINCI We've got a couple leads. We need a little more time. \nCAPT. HENDERSON I can't hold 'em off much longer. \nRODRIGUEZ This is no fuckin' way to run an investigation. \nCAPT. HENDERSON Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way. \nRodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then -- \nDIVINCI How much time we got? \nCAPT. HENDERSON A couple days. The funeral's this afternoon. \nRODRIGUEZ What funeral? \nCAPT. HENDERSON For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there. \nDIVINCI What for? We didn't know him. \nCAPT. HENDERSON How the hell do I know?! It's DEA, it's their thing. You're the cops on the case, I suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so you'll work all that harder to find his killer. Just go.

The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond the family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support and solidarity. A REVEREND delivering -- \nREVEREND -- and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most. And it's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others. And it's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him. Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man. And his death shall not be in vain. \nCAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back. Rodriguez looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is quiet. \nDIVINCI Don't Humpty Dumpty on me. \nRODRIGUEZ What's that mean? \nDIVINCI Your cracks are startin' to show. \nRODRIGUEZ (covering) Bullshit. \nDivinci sees Simms approaching from the side. \nDIVINCI Get your balance. Here comes the King. \nRodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the ceremony. \nSIMMS Glad you came... Anything break? \nDivinci glances at Rodriguez. \nDIVINCI Nothin' to brag about. But we've got a couple new leads we're followin'. \nSIMMS ...Look, normally we'd be all over this, but your Captain seems to think you can do the job. It's your territory. I guess you know it better than anybody. And that can be worth a lot. But you understand... we won't wait forever. \nDivinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms. \nDIVINCI Just outa curiosity... What happened to his backup? You guys use backup on undercover don't you? \nSIMMS It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid backup would blow his cover. He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down. He never checked in. \nRODRIGUEZ We want this one as bad as you do. A cop's a cop. We're in this together, right? \nSimms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he returns his attention to the ceremony. \nSIMMS That's why I asked you to come here.

Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns. Divinci is walking across the street from his car toward her. \nCYNTHIA It's the middle of the day. \nDivinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from her. \nDIVINCI Just talk. \nCYNTHIA Since when? \nDivinci leads the way into the apartment building. \nINT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock as Divinci enters behind her with the groceries. \nDIVINCI I need you to do something. \nCYNTHIA Good, I need the money. \nShe shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the table. Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen. \nDIVINCI This isn't a deal. Where you goin'? \nCYNTHIA I got perishables, okay? \nCynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into the refrigerator. \nDIVINCI The guy we did the last deal with is dead. \nCynthia turns suddenly. \nCYNTHIA What? \nDIVINCI Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff. I don't know. \nCYNTHIA Jesus, does anybody -- \nDIVINCI -- Don't worry, there's no connection.

POLICE STATION - DAY \nDivinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with Cynthia. She's nervous. Wants very much not to be here. \nDIVINCI He'll be third from the left. Don't fuck up. Third from the left. \nCYNTHIA What'm I supposed to say? \nDIVINCI Just look at 'em and then look at the man the third from the left and say, It's him. \nRODRIGUEZ And I'll say, Are you sure? \nDIVINCI And you say, Absolutely. No question. \nCYNTHIA This is all I need to do right? \nDIVINCI We have a signed confession. You i.d. him, he's goin' straight into the can. \nCYNTHIA Okay, okay. But this is it.

The LINEUP WALL is striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS.

SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters. \n", "test2_true": "The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down.

It's Joe. \nDivinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery. \nDIVINCI Take your time. Try and remember his face. \nCynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers -- \nCYNTHIA I know him. \nDivinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it looking like he's coaching her. \nDIVINCI If you can identify the man -- \nCYNTHIA (whisper) I know him. \nDIVINCI Just tell us which one. \nCynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look. \nCYNTHIA No. I fucking know him. \nDivinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. Rodriguez looks over, a little annoyed. \nRODRIGUEZ What's the problem? \nDIVINCI There's no problem! (to Cynthia; pointedly) Do you see him up there?! \nCYNTHIA (aside) You don't understand. \nDivinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel. The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on. So are the MEN in the line. \nONE OF THE MEN Hey, come on, do it or don't! \nTHE VOICE No talking. \nDivinci leans in close to her.

The conversation is strained. \nDIVINCI You mind telling me what that was all about?! \nCYNTHIA I know him. He hangs around my building. He lives in the alley or something. \nRodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem? \nDIVINCI You don't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody. Well let me tell you something. You don't live in a great fuckin' neighborhood. \nDivinci pulls a paper from his pocket. \nDIVINCI Just sign the goddamn paper. \nCYNTHIA What paper? \nRODRIGUEZ You picked a man out of a lineup, you have to sign that you did that so they don't think we made it up. \nCynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then -- \nCYNTHIA Now why the hell would they think something like that? \nDIVINCI Sign it. \nCYNTHIA You said all I had to do was pick him out. \nDIVINCI This is part of it.

Even the thought makes me sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It's two completely different things.

It's natural. Just don't lose your sense of humor. \nRODRIGUEZ My sense of humor, right. \nDIVINCI The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison.

Nothin' I ever do is good enough, you know? \nRODRIGUEZ Never is, never was, never will be. \nDIVINCI Guess I gotta make the effort. It's gonna cost me if I don't. \nRODRIGUEZ Tell me about it.

It is almost two o'clock in the morning. Helen has dozed off in her chair with a book on her lap. She is startled awake by a loud BANGING at the front door. Helen hurries to the door and opens it. Pamela is on the porch. She is out of breath and very distraught. Her CAR is parked in the middle of the street with its lights on and MOTOR RUNNING. 
HELEN Pamela, are you all right? 
PAMELA I need to talk to... 
Jacey comes down the stairs, pulling on his bathrobe. Doug appears on the stairs behind him. 
JACEY What's wrong? 
PAMELA Alice took some pills, some of my mother's pills... 
JACEY Oh, Jesus, no... 
PAMELA She's all right, we took her to the hospital... 
JACEY I'll get dressed... 
PAMELA No! 
JACEY I have to see her. 
PAMELA No. That's why she sent me, she doesn't want you to come, she was afraid you would if you heard from someone else. She's all right. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

112     CONTINUED:                                                     112 
PAMELA (CONT'D) They just want her to rest tonight, they said they might let her come home in a day or two. She just needs to rest. I've got to go, I'm supposed to be on my way home from the hospital. 
JACEY But I have to see her. 
PAMELA Dammit, no! I'm warning you, just wait! I'll let you know just as soon as she can see you. Please, don't make things worse. Don't. 
113     EXT. HOLT HOME                                                 113 
Pamela dashes back to her car. 
112     CONTINUED:                                                     112 
as Jacey walks down the remainder of the stairs and watches Pamela speed away. 
JACEY Jesus... 
Helen closes the front door and turns to say something to Jacey, but he cuts her off: 
JACEY Leave me alone, just leave me alone. 
Helen climbs the stairs, collects Doug at the top landing, and leads him away. 
Jacey punches his fist through a glass pane of the sheer- curtained sidelight beside the front door. 
114     EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - YARD - DAY (FIVE DAYS LATER)         114 
Doug is mowing the front lawn. 
115     INT. HOLT HOME - JACEY'S BEDROOM - DAY                         115 
The DRONE of the LAWN MOWER accompanies Jacey's pacing. His face is haggard and unshaven. He glances out the window and sees something that sends him bolting out of his bedroom. 
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                     78. 
116        EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - FRONT YARD - DAY (MOMENTS            116 LATER) 
Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam. Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak over the din of the LAWN MOWER.) 
JACEY How is she? 
PAMELA She's all right. 
JACEY Can I see her? 
PAMELA At the boathouse -- at the lake. 
Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway. 
Doug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down the driveway and then up the street. 
Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam. 
DOUG What's going on? 
She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes. 
PAMELA I had to... for Alice's sake. 
DOUG (puzzled) Had to what? What? 
PAMELA Tell Jacey I'm sorry. 
Pam drives away.

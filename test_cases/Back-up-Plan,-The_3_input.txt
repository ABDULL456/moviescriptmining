MONA Sure I am. 
ZOE You just told me that if I breast- feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks. 
MONA I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder. 
ZOE What does it do to your bladder? 
Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly. 
MONA I just peed a little bit. 
ZOE I don't think I'm pregnant. The doctor says it will probably take several tries. Something about frozen sperm being lazy. 
MONA Good.   Take your time. 
Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window. 
ZOE So, should I call this guy?   Do you think that would be weird? 
MONA Do I think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable? No. Because that's what you do. You sabotage. 
ZOE (ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market. And it's right around the corner. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
MONA I look fat and old? 
ZOE No. 
MONA Then, no. 
ZOE Let's go spy on him. Come on. It will be fun. Like high school. 
MONA I can't. (checks watch) This twenty minute breakfast concludes my "me" time for the week. More proof that you should not have kids. 
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY 
The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby. 
Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck. 
ZOE Oh, well. 
She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around. 
As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band. He's playing banjo. 
Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches. 
OLIVIA Can I help you? 
ZOE (distracted) No, I'm fine. 
Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan. 
OLIVIA Tasty, huh? 
Zoe nods and takes another berry. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right? 
Zoe now turns, confused. 
ZOE What? 
OLIVIA And don't look now, but he's coming this way. 
Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder. 
STAN A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all. 
ZOE (trying to be casual) I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie. 
STAN I love blueberry pie. 
Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe. 
ZOE I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something. 
STAN What makes you think I don't? 
ZOE I don't know, you're over there playing the banjo. 
STAN Can't someone do both? 
ZOE Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either.

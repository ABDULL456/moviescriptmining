LANDON (as Starbuck) 'It's got to be inside you. Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you. You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty. You'll be beautiful.' 
Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going. 
LANDON (as Starbuck) 'Look at me. Tell me what you see!' 
As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes. 
JAMIE (as Lizzie) 'Is it really me?' 
LANDON (as Starbuck, hamming) 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.' 
Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated. 
MS. GARBER Quiet! (announcing) Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck. 
Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon. 
LANDON (to Garber) No way. No thanks. I can't do it -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. KELLY (O.S.) (offstage) -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter. 
Kelly's been standing in the wings. 
MR. KELLY (warning) With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster. 
Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped. 
EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING 
Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind. 
LANDON (rude) You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere -- 
JAMIE -- This play means a lot to me. 
LANDON (snorting) This play -- ? 
JAMIE -- I know you don't suck at acting. 
Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night. 
JAMIE But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater -- 
LANDON -- What are you going on about? 
Pause. 
JAMIE I can judge too. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He exhales, eyeing her, daring her. 
JAMIE You don't care about classes or graduating. But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again. 
LANDON That's deep -- 
JAMIE -- Your act only works with an audience. 
LANDON My act?! 
She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last car in the parking lot. 
Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past. 
LANDON A ride?!   Please! 
INT. PONTIAC 
Jamie turns to look at him. 
JAMIE'S POV 
Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading. 
LANDON (insincere) We can talk about your helping me with my lines. 
INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER 
Jamie's at the wheel. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE I know you don't want help. 
LANDON Then we both know. (beat) I'll point. You drive.    Faster. 
He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks. The wet road glistens. 
JAMIE We're following fire trucks? 
LANDON Yeah.

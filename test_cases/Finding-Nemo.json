{"train": "NEMO Where? \nMARLIN There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here! \nMARLIN All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? \nNEMO It's not safe. \nMARLIN That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times-- \nNEMO Dad.. \nMARLIN All right. Come on, boy. \nNEMO Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark! \nMARLIN \nI highly doubt that. \nNEMO Have you ever met a shark? \nMARLIN No, and I don't plan to. \nNEMO How old are sea turtles? \nMARLIN Sea turtles? I don't know. \nNEMO Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about a hundred years old! \nMARLIN Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin. \nNEMO Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you? \nMARLIN Hey, that snail was about to charge.

Come on, give us a funny one. \nMARLIN Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. \nBILL Aw, come on, clownie. \nTED Yeah, do something funny. \nBOB Yeah! \nMARLIN All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them   were walking, so forget that I-- \nMARLIN Bye, Nemo! \nNEMO Bye, dad! \nMARLIN Bye, son! Be safe. \nBOB Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer. \nMARLIN Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you? \nBILL Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off. \nMARLIN They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!? \nBOB Hey, Marty. Calm down. \nMARLIN Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy! \nBOB 'Pony boy'? \nBILL You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. \nTED Pity. \nMR. RAY [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species that live in thesea. \nNEMO Whoa. \nMR.

See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. \nMARLIN Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this! \nDORY No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you? \nMARLIN Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps] \nBRUCE Hello. \nDORY Well, hi! \nBRUCE Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late, eh? \nMARLIN Nothing.

There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... \nNEMO Daddy! \nMARLIN Nemo! \nCHUM Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it. \nBRUCE For a clownfish, he's not that funny. \nMARLIN No, no, no, no.

Well for one, this    | | isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    | | may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     | | spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    | | where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   | | makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    | | 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   | | of equal signs (=).                                               | | This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    | | any.

It's beautiful. \nMARLIN So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver? \nCORAL My man delivered. \nMARLIN And it wasn't so easy. \nCORAL Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place. \nMARLIN You better believe they did--every single one of them. \nCORAL Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome. \nMARLIN So, you do like it, don't you? \nCORAL No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space? \nMARLIN Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by their bedroom window. \nCORAL Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids. \nMARLIN Oh, right. Right. \nCORAL Aww, look. They're dreaming.

All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done. \nCORAL I like Nemo. \nMARLIN Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. \nCORAL Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents! \nMARLIN Yeah. What if they don't like me? \nCORAL Marlin. \nMARLIN No, really. \nCORAL There's over 400 eggs.

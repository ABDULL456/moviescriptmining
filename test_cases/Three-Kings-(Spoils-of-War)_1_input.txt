WES Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either. 
JAEGER We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back. 
WES Then lets go back while we still can. 
JAEGER As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it. 
EPPS What do we do with the Humvee? 
JAEGER We leave it. 
WES What if someone takes it? 
Jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert. 
JAEGER Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark the location with the navicom, we can come right back to this spot. 
Wes has had enough. 
WES You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent. 
JAEGER You have to go with us, Wes. 
WES Really?  What is that, an order, private? 
JAEGER You have to go with us.  You can't walk back... 
Jaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger. 
JAEGER{CONT) And you sure as hell aren't going to drive. 
Wes burns a hole through Jaeger's head with his eyes.  Epps steps to him. 
EPPS Load what you can; water, tools, weapons. Anything you think we might need. 
Wes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the Hummer. Jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself. 
JAEGER Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As soon as we get back to Saudivillie you and me are going to-- 
Epps gets up in Jaeger's face.  The menace he projects is very real. 
EPPS We're going to keep going 'cause I want some of whatever's out there.  But you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again, and I'll kill you myself.  You got that? 
Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling. 
EPPS(CONT) SAY IT! 
JAEGER I got that...sir. 
Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes.  Epps and Wes trek side by side. 
Jaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up.  Between pants he gasps: 
JAEGER Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast. 
EPPS Faster we get there, faster we get back. 
JAEGER Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you. 
Jaeger struggles on just a bit more, then: 
JAEGER(CONT) I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water. 
EPPS Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours. 
JAEGER I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip. 
Jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand.  He looks up. Epps and Wes are still walking. 
JAGER{CONT) Wait for me! 
EPPS You can catch up. 
JAEGER Yeah...I'm right behind you. 
Wes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his water. 
WES Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.

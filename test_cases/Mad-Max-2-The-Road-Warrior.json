DAY. \nFlurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move through an eerie, barren land. The only sound is the howl of a rising wind. \nAhead something looms out of the storm. As we approach we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil pump. \nThe wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old man.

A CORRIDOR. 1k. We pass through a door designated: \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CHIEF EXECUTIVE At the other end of the imposing room we see a businessman clearing out his vast desk. His name is PAPPAGALLO. On the wall behind him we see photo- graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries. PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth Catalogue\" and another book. The cover reads: \n(PRODUCTION FOOTAGE) MAX stands looking down at two headstones... \nDISSOLVE. laa. IN FRONT OF A ROARING FIRE. laa.

DAWN, We soar along the empty highway, up and down its rises and around its curves until we are out in the vast wasteland. \n3. WASTELAND HIGHWAY. DAY. The black hole of the supercharger dominates the frame. Behind the wheel we see MAX looking about - his leathers 3 years older. He is gaunt, unkempt tattered and torn. The black-on-black pursuit car, bearing the scars of numerous road duels, cruises down the roller coaster highway. As MAX crests a hill he hits the brakes. His companion, a mongrel DOG, sitting in a baby's auto seat, lifts its bead to look. The black-on-black slides to a stop. \n4. RURAL SHACK ON HIGHWAY. DAY. On a ridge close to the road, silhouetted in a dust-blown \nLIKE MEN. field, is a strange assortment of WARRIO1 They are cannibalising a farm vehicle: siphoning its fuel and loading food and other loot into their bizarre vehicles. The DOG growls. MAX looks further along the ridge. On the bor:.zon we see a burning wooden s:iack and three bodies strung from a gnarled, dead tree. MAX looks back to the MEN. Several of then, having seen him, are running to their vehicles. The first of them is a muscular man with a red mohawk haircut. He is heavily protected by a leather and metal chest plate, shoulder pads and leggings. This is WEZ. Sc. 4. Cont.. \n4. Gont. 11 . He runs to where a GOLDEN YOUTH sits on the pillion seat of a huge bike. WEZ is followed by TWO MORE MOHAWKERS on bikes, THREE GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers and FOUR SMEGMA CRAZIES in bizarre dune buggies. MAX guns the big motor. The black-on-black takes off. MAX hits the supercharger - surging away. Through the rear window we see WEZ lead the other nine vehicles down the hill, giving chase... \nWIPE. \n5. ELSEWHERE ON THE HIGHWAY. --(A LITTLE LATER). DAY. 5. High angle helicopter shot of the chase. The Marauders' vehicles are strung down the highway. Only the fastest, led by Wee, can keep up with the black-on-black. \n13. Cont. 13, As the car crests a rise MAX looks ahead and sees a large kite - in the shape of a man's grinning face - hovering above a dune. MAX leaves the DOG to guard the car .nd, carrying a jerry can and a tyre iron, cautiously makes his way across the sand. \n14. ON THE DUNES. DAY. 14. From the,top of the dune MAX sees that the kite is tethered to an abandoned vehicle: a primitive version of a gyrocopter - little more than a motor, a seat and a rotor mounted on a chassis. A set of footprints leads from the gyrocopter, dune and disappears into the distance. Slowly MAX approaches the vehicle, skirting around it, looking for a trap. Nothing moves except for the flurries of sand whirling across the dunes. \n15. THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 15. Carefully, MAX reaches up and taps the gas tank: empty. As he straightens up, he hears a low hiss. MAX freezes. Only inches away a snake, coiled around the vertical shaft of the gyro, is poised to strike.. They stare at each other. The snake strikes... MAX springs... hand flashing... catching it by the neck. He holds up the snake, grinning, about to kill, it. The head and shaft of an arrow emerge from the sand behind him. It is followed by the frame of a crossbow and a man's face, spitting sand, a length of rubber hose clenched in his teeth. This is the GYRO CAPTAIN. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Don't hurt that snake! \n15, Cont. 15, MAX turns. The CAPTAIN emerges from his shallow grave, motioning with the crossbow. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Put him back... gently! MAX lays the snake on the rotor. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Sounded like a big V-8 to me. I guess I got myself some guzzolene. He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing to fire. \nMAX The car's booby-trapped. Touch those tanks and BOOM! You'll blow yourself apart. The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with the crossbow. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Drop the weapons... Now back up. MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn-off shotgun. The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder. \n1.6. THE DESERT ROAD - MAX'S CAR.DAY. 16. MAX walks backwards towards his car. The CAPTAIN tense, crossbow trained on MAX, follows him across the dune. Sc, 1.6. Cont.. \n16. Cont. \nGYRO CAPTAIN You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that's what you've got. Me? I've got brains.

MAX is driving the black-on-black while the CAPTAIN sits rigid in the passenger's seat. The muzzle of the shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and the stock fastened to the top of the seat. A length of wire runs from the triggers across to the DOG sitting in the rear of the car. The end of the wire is clasped firmly in its mouth. The CAPTAIN, not daring to take his eyes off the DOG directs MAX along back roads to an area of high country. The DOG'S eyes dart out the window. He whimpers, body twitching. The CAPTAIN stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through the scrub. MAX smiles t') himself. The DOG settles back. i8. A CLIFFTOP OVERLOOKING THE COMPOUND. DAY. MAX moves towards the cliff edge. A column of smoke rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant sounds: police sirens; car horns; men screaming; war-whoops; and revving motors. The GYRO CAPTAIN - manacled and guarded by the DOG - hobbles along behind MAX. From the top of the cliff MAX looks down On a battle raging on the plain below. A fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch and coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large gang of MARAUDERS: MOHAWK BIKERS, SMEGMA CRAZIES in dune buggies, and GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers. They attack along a road which passes through an area - outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation. Three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a newly-ploughed field. As the Marauders' vehicles come within range of the compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing crossbows at the DEFENDERS ranged along the battlements. \nGYRO CAPTAIN I Well.,. I never said it'd be easy. MAX unhooks an old pair of binoculars from the equipment belt around his,waist. \n19, THE COMPOUND. POV BINOCULARS. DAY. Through the binoculars MAX sees a weird dune buggy charging towards the camp. He recognises the two bizarre occupants as members of the gang be encountered sacking the farmiet the day before. The dune buggy races along a causeway which spans the which blocks ditch, heading for a yellowPAschool SSENGERuin buggy the gate of the camp. fires a string of arrows from a multi-barrel gas-gun. A WARRIOR WOMAN on the battlement, armed with a flame- thrower, hits the buggy with a stream of liquid fire. The blazing vehicle plunges into the ditch. It tumbles - its into another wreck which met a similar fate tyres still smouldering. MAX pans his binoculars to the interior of the compound. He sees a large mechanical pump drawing the oil. from the ground and a primitive fractionating column used to refine it. A DEFENDER firing from the refinery tower is struck by an arrow. He falls over the guard rail, where a dead companion hangs over the edge, suspended by his foot. The sound of an amplified voice draws MAX'S attention, He swings the binoculars around: \n20. THE HILLSIDE ACROSS FROM TH.E COMPOUND. DAB . A huge, muscular man - his face covered by a metal mask - sits in a bizarre six-wheeled vehicle. He uses a microphone to shout orders to the MARAUDERS, directing the course of the battle. This man is the HUMUNGUS. Beside him, is the Mohawk Biker called WEZ. He sits astride his bike, the GOLDEN YOUTH clinging to his waist. He speaks with HUMUNGUS, pointing, sweeping his hand. \n21. CLIFFTOP. DAY. The GYRO CAPTAIN is becoming more agitated. \nI \nGYRO CAPTAIN Okay, there it is. If anyone can get in, I know it's gonna be you. Me,.. I've gotta feed the snakes. Sc. 21, Cont - \n21,. Cont. MAX drops the binoculars. The CAPTAIN offers his wrists to be unmanacled. \nGYRO CAPTAIN A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine... MAX gets to his feet and hauls the GYRO CAPTAIN to a nearby tree stump. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Look! We had a deal: I show you the gas - You let me go. MAX starts to chain him to the stump. \nMAX The contract was: wouldn't kill you. The GYRO CAPTAIN turns angry, protesting. MAX pushes the shotgun close to his face. \nMAX I reckon you got a bargain... Don't you? The CAPTAIN shuts up. MAX tests the chain. The sounds of the battle continue. \nGYRO CAPTAIN What's up!! MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below. ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS, camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp, Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It passes out-of sight around the back of the hill, MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop. \n29. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 29. MAX looks past the black-on-black, to where the lone compound vehicle has achieved the bitumen. Suddenly, three Mohawk bikes and a tow truck emerge from behind a rocky outcrop. Led by WEZ, they fire arrows into the tyres and smash the windscreen. The compound vehicle leaves the road, rolling... As the GYRO CAPTAIN crawls to his side, MAX raises his binoculars... \n30. MAX'S POV BINOCULARS. MORNING. 30. The bloodied driver is being dragged from the wreck by TWO MOHAWKERS. The others cannibalise the vehicle and siphon off its fuel. Another occupant emerges from the twisted metal and tries to crawl away... I t is a YOUNG WOMAN. \n31, REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 31. The GYRO CAPTAIN sees her and fumbles urgently for something deep in the pockets of his great-coat. He produces a large telescope which is attached to his waist by a leather cord. \n.1 C \n32. GYRO CAPTAIN'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING. 32. Through the cracked lens of the telescope we see two of the MOHAWIMRS dragging the woman to the roadside. \n33. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 33. MAX looks around to see the GYRO CAPTAIN'S telescope and grabs it. The GYRO CAPTAIN, protesting, picks up the less-powerful binoculars. MAX lifts tae telescope. \n34. MAX'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING. 34, The GOLDEN YOUTH is sitting on one of the bikes. The POV whip pans across the wreck where two MOHAWKERS have pushed the badly injured driver up to the car panel, WEZ fires an arrow into the man's shoulder, pinning it to the panel.. Methodically, he reloads and fires another pin into the man's other shoulder. MAX pans the telescope to where the three MOHAWKERS hold the STRUGGLING WOMAN. At WEZ'S signal they start to tear the woman's clothes away... \n35. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 35, Track in as the GYRO CAPTAIN and MAX watch through the binoculars and telescope. Camera tightens further to the GYRO CAPTAIN. His face reacts to the horror below. MAX drops his head... his eyes closing momentarily. The noise of vehicles starting below breaks the moment. He lifts the telescope and pans to one side. \nI \n-1 W \n36, MAX'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING. 36, The zelescope lens finds all the MOHAWKERS except one back on their vehicles. They ride off led by WEZ... \n41. INT. BLACK-ON-BLACK.DAY \nThe supercharger screams as MAX races towards the compound. NATHAN is slipping into unconsciousness. MAX grabs him by the shoulder, shaking him. \nMAX Stay alive! Stay alive! \nI \n1Q. \n4'L, UN XAtl n1LL1Ur. Phum hAMAU1Jtn\"_11 LUUrL UU1 . VAX . 4G Angle down on the plain. The black-on-black approaches the burnt out huts. A GAYBOY BERSERKER stands up into frame in the extreme foreground. He is joined by TWO OTHER MARAUDERS. The GAYBOY BERSERKER grabs a hand-mirror and flashes a signal across the wasteland. From a far hill, we see the answering flash. \n43. THE PLOUGHED FIELD. DAY. 43. Crane down from a high angle on the black-on-black as it approaches the camp. As the camera achieves a smouldering but we see a small animal-like figure stalking the vehicle. Tracking closer we see that it is a wild-looking child, about 8 years old. He is dressed in dog skins and carries a chrome boomerang. On one hand he wears what looks like a catcher's mitt: a leather glove reinforced with steel plates. This is the FERAL KID. Before we get too close the boy scurries into a large rabbit warren. \n44. THE CAUSEWAY LEADING TO THE COMPOUND. DAY. 44. Long low angle on the compound. Its defenders wait on the barricades, the cracking tower and the catwalk. The black car stops just outside crossbow range - about twenty yards short of the compound. In extreme foreground, the FERAL BOY'S head pops up from another rabbit hole closer to the compound. He ducks down out of sight when the car door opens. High angle on MAX as he steps out of the car with NATHAN across his shoulders. MAX carries no weapons and as he steps up to camera, he raises his arms high... A woman on the barricade begins screaming. Her name is BIG REBECCA, Sc-44, Cont. \n44, Cont. 44. \nBIG REBECCA Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan. A man on the catwalk orders the gate to be opene\u00e2\u0080\u00a23.. MAX hurries along the causeway... The FERAL KID comes out of the rabbit warren and begins to follow MAX. A trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the causeway... As MAX approaches the camp the old \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdello'.v school bus is pulled aside. The I A3IRI011 WOMAN emerges, crossbow read., , keeping it trained on MAX. She is followed by another defender the MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT - pulling a strange mechanised crane. Suspended from the front of this machine is a paraplegic, He is the MECHANIC. Thny MAX, heading for the car, revealing BIG RLU,CC.A, distraught, running towards him, \nBIG REBECCA Nathan! God have mercy., What a waste. Si,F wipe the man's face, caressing him., as MAX walks on. She turns and looks straight at the camp's leader, PAPPAGALLO. He\"is standing at the gate, surrounded by anxious defenders. \nBIG REBECCA Look at your handiwork! They didn't have a chance... One of the group at the gate -- a nuggety old man called the CURMUDGEON - plays to the crowd, pointing \nHUMUNGUS You set out this morning to find a vehicle. A vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas... Suddently, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the barricade and out into the wasteland. WEZ whirls his arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a crossbow bolt. The FERAL KID eases back down into his hole. The TOADIE bellows: \nTOADIE You see! There is no escape. The Humungus rules the wasteland... \nDEFIANT VICTIM Don't give them the gas! Blow it up! WEZ leaps from his bike and head-butts the man into unconsciousness, The BROKEN VICTIM sobs uncontrollably. Sc. 50. Cont... \n50. cont. 5Q. The FERAL BOY runs from his hole, screaming. He lets fly with the chrome boomerang... The projectile whistles past WEZ'S head and returns to the KID. He reaches up and - clunk! catches it in his steel, plated mitten. The MARAUDERS roar with laughter. The FERAL KID throws the boomerang again... WEZ ducks and it buries itself into the head of the \nGOLDEN YOUTH. The MARAUDERS are dumbstruck. \n51. THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. 51. The MECHANIC grimaces. The rest of the DEFENDERS are silent. MAX is impressed. \n52, NO MAN'S LAND. DAY. 52. WEZ bends over the GOLDEN'YOUTH and pulls the weapon from his skull. He hurls it at the FERAL KID. The boomerang whistles across the ground... the KID throws himself down into the hole... the boomerang arcs and returns to WEZ... out of his reach. The TOADIE runs forward... \nTOADIE I got it! I got it! He reaches up to catch it... Sc. 52. Cont... \nJf.. vv... Then falls to his knees clutching his bleeding fingerless hand. The HUMUNGUS and MARAUDERS roar with laughter. WEZ, bellowing with rage, leaps up dnto the HUMUNGUS vehicle. He hits the ignition, yelling: \nWEZ There's been enough talk. I'm going in! Powerful arms encircle him from behind. WEZ is lifted bodily from the seat. The HUMUNGUS reaches over and cuts the ignition and the P.A..system. \n53. THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. The CAMP PEOPLE ease back on their weapons... MAX is concentrating on his manacles, starting to use a small, file to pick the lock. \n54, THE HUMUNGUS VEHICLE. DAY. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Maintaining his vicious hold on WEZ the HUMUNGUS hisses soothingly in his ear. \n60, NO MAN'S LAND. NIGHT. 60. MAX emerges from the ditch, the heavy load weighing him down. Behind him, the searchlight from the compound plays over the wilderness. Ahead, he sees the glow of the Marauders' campfires. He moves forward silently. \n61. NEAR THE MAHAUDL S ' CAM1'k i hLJ . NIGHT. 61, Picking his way carefully across rugged ground, MAX skirts close to a large campfire. Around it, a GROUP OF MARAUDERS are carousing: some are laughing loudly at a VICTIM strung up to a beam by his wrists. A bottle passes among the MARAUDERS. In the shadows, lit by the flickering flame, a MOHAWK BIKER fondles TWO CAMP FOLLOWERS. Closest to MAX a GAYBOY BERSERKER hones his machete on a whetstone. MAX skirts round him, not taking his eyes off him. Suddenly MAX'S leg gives way, caught in a rabbit hole. He pitches forward, the ferry cans thumping together. The GAYBOY BERSERKER pivots.., listening.., knife ready. MAX is spread-eagled on the ground. The DOG curls its lip. The GAYBOY BERSERKER walks towards MAX, his eyes searching the darkness... There is a loud barking! MAX looks up... On a rabbit warren close by, the FERAL KID sits on his haunches, howling like a wild dog. The GAYBOY BERSERKER takes a rock and throws it, curs- ing all howling dogs, and returns to the camp. The FERAL KID motions for MAX to follow. Keeping low, MAX limps forward. \n62. AN EROSION DITCH. NIGHT. 62. The FERAL KID stops at the edge of the gully and indicates the direction for MAX to take. He grins at MAX and runs off into the night, back the way he came. MAX drops down into the gully heading away from the Marauders' camp. \nDISSOLVE, \n63. THE CLIFFTOP. FIRST LIGHT. 63. MAX climbs up to the spot where he left the GYRO CAPTAIN. Gone!... Just the canopy, a dog food can and a freshly- dug hole where the tree stump used to be. A clear trail, gouged in the dirt, leads back towards the sand dune country. The DOG sniffs and lopes off,.. \n64, A CLAY PAN. DAY. \nMAX and the DOG crest a rise at the edge of the pan. About a hundred yards ahead, out on the clay, is the CAPTAIN, still dragging the tree stump behind him. T h e DOG growls. The CAPTAIN turns to see MAX, He picks up the log and tries to run. \n65. THE WASTELAND. DAY. \nThe sun is much higher in the sky, The CAPTAIN has been freed from the tree stump and now carries the ferry cans, coolie-like, across his shoulders. \n66. THE DUNES. DAY. \nThe three travellers stagger over the dune. Tha gyro copter is intact though the kite now rests face dawn on the sand, At the crest of the dune they sue the body of a lone Marauder. Foot and tyre prints tell the story. Crossing the dunes in his buggy, he happened across the gyrocopter. He left his buggy, walked down to the abandoned gyrocopter and fell victim to the snake, He staggered around in circles before slumping face down in the sand. The CAPTAIN lets out a whoop as he and MAX half stumble, half run towards the body. \nCAPTAIN I knew it. I knew it'd work. Lethal, those snakes. Lethal. Born killers. The snake's fangs, my brains. Lethal I \nMAX It's up to you. Fly a kite, or follow me back. Maybe they'll throw some gas your \nKAY MAX eases the prime mover down the road: Sc. 69. Cont. hn. \n69, Cont. 69. The GYRO CAPTAIN, struggling to unlock his manacles, yells after him: \nGYRO CAPTAIN What sort of deal's that?! I'm running on empty! \nWIPE. \n70, THE LONELY HIGHWAY. DAY. 70. MAX hurls the prime mover down the long empty highway, eating up the miles. \nWIPE. \n71. HILL CREST NEAR PINNACLES. DAY. 71. The'prime mover crests a bill. In the distance MAX can see the pinnacles surrounding the camp. He checks his shotgun on the seat beside him. MAX tramps the accelerator. The DOG climbs under the seat. The back wheels burn rubber as the prime mover thunders down the road... Suddenly the gyrocopter zooms over the rise behind him spluttering and coughing like he's running out of gas. \n72. SIDE OF ROAD NEAR THE PINNACLES. DAY. 72. In the Marauders' camp a MOHAWKER is shaving WEZ'S head. At the sound of the approaching prime mover, WEZ leaps to his feet, clambers over a tow truck on blocks and straddles his bike... Other MARAUDERS follow as we track to a SKINHEAD lying under the tow truck making noisy repairs. \nIN \n73. THE ituiL. DA1. MAX burls the prime mover towards the rise above the compound. A dune buggy comes up alongside the rear passenger wheel. The SMEGMA CRAZY riding shotgun fires a crossbow arrow into a tyre... which explodes. WEZ appears on the road ahead as a road racer rockets from out of the scrub in front of the prime mover. MAX shunts it back off the road and into the rear of the tow truck on blocks. The tow truck crashes down, pinning the SKINHEAD beneath it. 74, A RISE ABO'D'E rHE COMPOUND. DAY. 74. The HUMUNGUS - his vehicle sitting in_the middle of the road - turns at the sound of the crash. \n75, THE GYR000PTER. (HELICOPTER MOUNT).

The GYRO CAPTAIN is reaching down into a sack... He pulls out two snakes. Clamping their jaws shut he kisses them goodbye and hurls them down... \n84. THE APPROACH TO THE CAUSEWAY. DAY. 84. .The snakes land in the 4-pak dune buggy - one of them between the DRIVER'S legs. Perplexed, he reaches down for it... pulling it up to look... He screams.., the snake has its fangs in his hand... 85. THr CAUSEW'.Y. DAY. 85. The 4-pak dune buggy swerves out of control... up and over the back of the prime mover,., and onto the street car. Locked together, both vehicles tumble down into the ditch. I n th,! cabin of the truck MAX smashes the butt of the shotgun into \\EZ'S face, again and again. WEZ just grins. \n86. THE COMPOUND GATE. DAY. 86. The prime mover thunders through the gate. PAPPAGALLO and WARRIOR WOMAN take their positions on the battlements... As soon as the prime mover clears the gate BIG REBECCA plants her foot on the accelerator of the school bus/gate. The Lone Wolf vehicle and the dune buggy just make it inside. The DOG scampers through the rapidly closing gap. A road racer slides up to the gate. The DRIVER looks up... to see PAPPAGALLO aiming the flame thrower down at him... He slams the vehicle into reverse... \nb. r nu..: i hL 6A , i LS:h1Li\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1 `J LVVh l lvla UL, l . bA i . 6 PAPPAGALLO sends the torrent of flames down on the retreating vehicle... as HUMUNGUS and the OTHER MARAUDERS hover at the entrance of the causeway... \n88., INSIDE THE COMPOUND THE CATWALK AREA. DAY. 88. The prime mover slides to a halt underneath a catwalk. - As SEVERAL CAMP PEOPLE run towards him, WEZ swings up onto the roof of the prime mover and onto the catwalk. The two Marauder vehicles stop in the middle of the compound. MAX jumps out of the prime mover assessing the situation. In addition to WEZ there are FOUR MARAUDERS inside the compound: the LONE WOLF, the LONE WOLF'S PASSENGER and TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES. \n89, THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. 89. Undei the direction of the HUMUNGUS - HALF A DOZEN MARAUDERS come surging up the causeway on foot. PAPPAGALLO stands up on the very limit of the battle- ment and scares them off with a burst of flame. A MARAUDER fires an arrow.. , .PAPPAGALLO is hit high up in the thigh. He tumbles backwards, off the parapet and crE.shes to the ground below. \n90, INSIDE THE. COMPOUND - THE CRACKING TOWER. DAY 90. Up on the catwalk WEZ is shouting at the FOUR \nOTHER INVADERS. \nWEZ The gate! The gate! Move!! MAX looks around as the LONE WOLF, the LONE WOLF PASSENGER and the TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES start to sprint across the compound towards the gate... Thud! The LONE WOLF PASSENGER falls dead - an arrow in his back... \n9u. Cont. 90. WEZ spins around to see the QUIET MAN, standing on the cooling tower, reloading his bow. WEZ starts running towards him. \n91. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 91. With the help of the DOG, MAX tackles the-FIRST SMEGMA CRAZY who is running towards the gate. They land at the foot of the pump. The FERAL BOY, bouncing up and down on top of the pump looks down gleefully, as the FARMER, the BUTCHER and the CURMUDGEON descend on the \nMARAUDER. MAX is on his feet running towards PAPPAGALLO, as the second SMEGMA CRAZY is hit by the MECHANIC flying on the end of his lattice-arm contraption. ANGIE and PISMC, manning the other end, smile with satisfaction. \n99. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 99. BIG REBECCA has just pulled the arrow out of PAPPAGALLO'S leg as MAX moves into view. PAPPAGALLO watches him walk towards the black-on -black - its nose poking out of the pyramid workshop, As MAX passes the gyrocopter we see the GYRO CAPTAIN in conversation with the CURMUDGEON. \nCURMUDGEON .and tell me, son, this machine of yours - it takes two , does it? The GYRO CAPTAIN glances over the CURMUDGEON'S shoulder at LUSTY who is admiring the gyrocopter. \nGYRO CAPTAIN er... possibly. The FERAL KID steps forward, holding his hand out stiffly to MAX. MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious. As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky, stiff-legged gait. \n1.00, INT. PYRAMID WORKSHOP. LATE AFTERNOON. 100. \nThrough the maze of pipes in the peak of the pyramid, we have a high angle down on MAX working on the black-on-black below. The FERAL KID comes into view in the foreground, climbing along the pipes. The KID is softly humming a tune - approximating the first few notes of \"Happy Birthday\". On the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfer- ring fuel from a 44 gallon drum into the black-on- black's fuel tanks. MAX is re-arming the booby traps - connecting a string of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps. His utility belt and jacket are off and he has laid his personal. effects on a nearby work bench. In the background, through the arched doorway we see Sc. 100. Cont. \n1VU. i\u00e2\u0080\u009euliL'. the MECHANIC and his TEAM working on the truck with arc welders, lights and so on. MAX looks up: The CURMUDGEON is leading PAPPAGALLO'into the workshop. \nCURMUDGEON See! I told ya. I said he was leaving. High up in the pyramid the FERAL KID starts to swing down the pipes - towards the bench where MAX has laid his jacket and utility belt. On the floor, PAPPAGALLO \nCONFRONTS MAX: \nPAPPAGALLO I don't have time for thanks. You know what you did out _ there and what it means to us. Come with us, MAX. Drive the tanker. MA:. continues to work - muffling the four exhausts by plugging them with rags. \nMAX We had a contract. I did my job, I got my car and I got my gas. End of story. \nPAPPAGALLO It doesn't have to be - we'll make a new contract. I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life, I can offer you a future. The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited. \nCURMUDGEON You gotta come. Look! He produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which bears the heading: \nMECHANIC - Go on! Go! Just another mercenary! He spits. MAX ignores him, dragging the plate past Pappagallo's tent. It is crowded with CAMP PEOPLE, laying their plans for escape. They fall silent, turning to watch MAX. \n104, COMPOUND WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 104. The black-on-black waits next to the fence, near the place where the Mohawkers attempted to build the \"bridge of cars\" across the ditch. MAX has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is manouevrin6 the metal plate on top of the first car starting to build a ramp from thw, compound, over the top of the cars and onto the far side of the ditch. \nDISSOLVE. \n105, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. LATER THAT NIGHT. 105 The HUMUNGUS has stepped up his theatrics of terror. His voice booms across the night - reciting dark poetic descriptions of death and hell. The CAMP PEOPLE, gathered in Pappagallo's tent, watch as the GYRO CAPTAIN walks towards the spot where MAX is working. PAPPAGALLO sits at his desk,flicki.ng an egg timer: the sand trickling from one end to the other. E. fs \n106. CUMI'OUNU WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 106, MAX, who is locking the last metal plate into position, looks up at the GYRO CAPTAIN. \nGYRO CAPTAIN I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent. \nGYRO CAPTAIN I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head. \nMAX I haven't got time to explain. Just believe me - I've got everything I want. The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him short. \nMAX Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it. Sc. 106. Cont. \n106. cont. 106, MAX puts out his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The CAPTAIN, a little surprised, shakes hands with him. \nGYRO CAPTAIN Thanks. Thanks a lot. The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders. MAX opens the door of the black-on-black. \nBERSERKER. The GAYBOY BERSERKER flicks down the toggle switch: there is a mighty roar matched by a massive surge of power in the Humungus machine... The TWO VICTIMS on the front scream... MAX is bewildered by the massive acceleration. ._ The Humungus machine leaps alongside the black-on-black. WEZ swings the chrome pipe down through the front windscreen -, into MAX'S face. \n114. A CURVE IN THE HIGHWAY. MORNING. 1.14. The black-on-black takes out a guide post and leases the road... rolling over and over. Inside the car MAX - his face bloodied - and the DOG are slammed around in the cabin of the black-on-black. It continues rolling, over and over again, into a gully. \n115, THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 115. What is left of the car comes to rest, upside down, among the boulders of a dry creek bed. MAX is slumped, dangling in his harness - his face and body bloodied and broken. Somthing moves... it's the DOG pulling himself out of the wreckage. He licks and paws at MAX'S face. One eye flickers open. \nAN \nl lu . hUAU:,ILL . MORNING . 116. WEZ stands looking down into the gully. Another vehicle has arrived. TWO GAYBOY BERSERKERS and the TOADIE scramble down towards the wreck carrying jerry cans. \nWE- Don't waste him. If he's alive I want him. \n117. THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 117. By an enormous force of will, MAX frees himself from the harness and - as the sound of the Marauders approaches - pulls himself through the window of the wreck. He falls to the ground, dragging his crippled body into the shadow of a large boulder, hiding there. The DOG confronts the MARAUDERS, snarling, standing between them and the wreck. One of the GAYBOY BERSERKERS raises his crossbow... MAX watches, grim-faced, as the DOG falls dead. The THREE MARAUDERS run to the vehicle. While the TOADIE prepares to siphon off the gas, the other two peer into the crushed cabin. Perplexed, they examine the wreck more closely, looking for MAX.. . ONE of them sees the drag marks, leading down the creek bed. He signals to the OTHER MARAUDER... MAX prepares to defend himself... the TOADIE prises the cap off the black car's fuel tank. The booby trap explodes... the petrol ignites... the THREE MARAUDERS are engulfed by a giant fireball. MAX looks pa3t the flames, staring up at WEZ, not taking his eyes off him... \n118, ROADSIDE. MORNING. 118. WEZ and the OTHER MARAUDERS watch the great pillar of smoke rise up into the sky. They return to their vehicles. \n119. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. MORNING. 119. The GYRO CAPTAIN helps the LUSTY GIRL dismantle one of the small tents. In the background we see the camp vehicles standing ready - fully loaded. The Mechanic's TEAM are still working on the prime mover. As PISMO shows from the tower, the GYRO CAPTAIN looks up to see the smoke from the wreck rising into the sky. The GYRO.CAPTAIN, mutters an oath and sprints towards is machine. \n120. CREEK BED. DAY. 120, Foot by foot, MAX drags himself alor:g the creekbed - heading for the compound. Blood seeps from wounds on his head and face. His legs are useless, his hands heavily bandaged with strips from his leather jacket. Behind him, in the distance, we see the still- smouldering wreck of the black-on-black. MAX struggles on, the pain growing, the sun climbing, the temperature soaring. His mind becomes more feverish: the wasteland dissolves into the heat haze; the buzz of the flies around his face becomes the steady drone of an engine. The gyrocopter appears above him. \n121. ON BOARD THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 121. MAX, strapped to the chassis of the gyrocopter, drifts back to consciousness. He sees the compound surging towards them as they come in to land. He drifts back into unconsciousness, the images distorting, dissolving,.. \n122. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE BREAD VAN. DAY.- 122. MAX'S eyes flicker open to a slow, distorted version of \nPAPPAGALLO You'll, need these... He tosses MAX his sawn-off shotgun and a bandolier containing six cartridges. \n126. CRACKING TOWER. HIGH ANGLE. WHOLE SCENE.DAY. 126. The tanker stands at the far end of the compound. Behind it, the GYRO CAPTAIN is spinning the rotor of his machine. A dune buggy and the Lone Wolf's car - armour-plated since being captured by the camp - wait on either side of the tanker. Beyond the gate the MARAUDERS have formed an arc of vehicles just out of crossbow range. The Hiunungus machine stands at its centre. \n127. INS ID THE COMPOUND. DAY. 127. MAX sits in the tanker, checking out the controls, familiarising himself with the machine... WARRIOR WOMAN stands on the running board. She turns as the MECHANIC clambers on board. He glares at her, daring her to stop him: \nMECHANIC I sweated blood on this mother. And no bastard's gonna make me go in no lousy bread van. MAX kicks over the big engine... \n12\u00c2\u00a33 . oiY33IDh THE CUM UUNV . LM I . WEZ stands on the back of a tow truck, beyond him we see the arc of vehicles, engines gunning, straining at the leash... The Humungus vehicle eases forward into frame... The TWO VICTIMS on the front of his vehicle have their heads hooded. \n129. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. MAX is revving the engine higher and higher. WARRIOR WOMAN climbs up to the top of the tanker... PAPPAGALLO starts the assault vehicle. WARRIOR WOMAN finds the FERAL KI.D crouched down in her position behind the protective plate. Holding the KID by his arm, she passes him down to MAX who passes him down to the ground... PAPPAGALLO yells for someone to come and take him... The LUSTY GIRL runs forward... the FERAL KID avoids her. MAX engages the engine. The tanker rumbles forward, gathering speed as it runs the length of the compound. BIG REBECCA, at the wheel of the school bus draws the vehicle aside - revealing the burnt out wreck of the road racer on the causeway and the MARAUDERS beyond. \n130. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND.__ DAY. 130. The HUMUNGUS has opened his gun case and removes the magnum 44. The remaining 4 bullets have been placed in the revolving chamber... \n131, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY.

The HUMUNGUS, raises his gun, calmly taking aim at the oncoming tanker... As the tanker accelerates towards him, the gyrocopter swoops out of the compound and over the MARAUDERS. The GYRO CAPTAIN drops three burning molotov cocktails. They fall in and around a road racer at one end of the arc... the road racer bursts into flames... The GYRO CAPTAIN whoops with delight. \n1.32. THE BREAK OUT. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 132. With the Lone Wolf machine and the dune buggy close alongside, MAX steers the tanker towards the burning road racer. The HUMUNGUS fires... once... The bullet dents the protective plate mounted on the front of the tanker but does no further damage. Twice... three times! Two more dents, The tanker keeps going crashing through the burning wreck... breaking the Marauders' cordon... \n133. ON BOARD THE BYROCOPTER. DAY. 133, The GYRO CAPTAIN has banked around and is swooping low. Having swung around, the GYRO CAPTAIN, swoops down, taking aim on the Humungus machine with another fistful. of lighted bottles. The HUMUNGUS looks up. He swings the revolver up, taking aim at the approaching gyrocopter. He fires! The bullet hits, piercing the right rudder peddle. Dropping his bottles, the GYRO CAPTAIN screams and looks down: blood pours from what is left of his right foot. \ni J\u00e2\u0080\u00a2x 1111: 411 JL' VV I JILL if1L LUBll'V441L. LNi. 134. MAX glances up to see the gyrocopter, flying ezaatically,, swoop over and bank away towards the horizon.. On top of the tanker WARRIOR WOMAN and the MECHANIC prepare to fire their weapons. Behind them, the HUMUNGUS and his HORDE power over the rise, pursuing the tanker. Suddenly, three of the Marauder vehicles skid to a halt, They start to turn back towards the compound, where the remaining camp vehicles are making their bid for freedom. The bread van and three other vehicles have followed the yellow school bus out onto the causeway. They skirt round the back of the compound and head off across country. The HUMUNGUS screams at his men through the amplifier: \n159. THE REAR OF THE TANKER. DAY. 159, Bellowing through his loudspeakers, the HUMUNGUS organises the destruction of the tanker.

MAX watches as he picks up the crossbow lying on the bonnet... \nMAX Get back! For Chrissakes! The KID doesn't understand... He clambers onto the roof before MAX can grab him. The tanker shudders again as another tyre is blown out. MAX watches through the rear window as\"the KID jumps from the cabin to the top of the tanker and then disappears from view. 161. TOP OF THi TANKER. DAY. 161, The KID tries to load the crossbow as he clambers along the top of the tanker... The bow string is too powerful for him to draw. \n162. REAR OF THE TANKER.

DAY, 165. The KID is trying to climb back onto the top of the tanker. Wez's tow truck comes into view. WEZ fires... The KID is pinned by his dogskins to the side of the tank... He tries to free himself... he tears his dogskin off the arrow and reaches up once more to the top of the tanker. WEZ fires again. The arrow pierces the KID'S arm, pinning him to the tank . . . \n1.66. THE FRONT OF THE TANKER. DAY. 166. MAX is fighting to bring the crippled tanker under control... he changes down, wrestling with the wheel., stewing across the road. PAPPAGALLO draws alongside his doorway, yelling: \nPAPPAGALLO Jump! Its finished. Jump! MAX turns around, looking for the KID... The tanker leaves the road and ramps up on the embankment, rolling to a stop. \nPAPPAGALLO Jump! \nMAX The Kid?! Cr 1AF runt \niou. Lont. 166. \nMAX What happened to the boy?! \nPAPPAGALLO We've gotta keep going. It's our only chance. MAX raises the Bear Claw arm to PAPPAGALLO'S face.

He and the THREE OTHER MARAUDERS - all on-.bikes - accelerate away from the tanker. Dead bodies litter the ground. WEZ urges the OTHER THREE on - pursuing the Lone Wolf machine. As the Humungus machine winds around the bends, we see, the Lone Wolf vehicle approaching over a distant hillcrest. \n170. UNDULATING HIGHWAY, DAY. 170. MAX guns the vehicle over the rise... Over his shoulder we see the Humungus machine, 400 yards away, approaching at terrific speed... MAX steels himself... 300 yards. The two vehicles are on direct collision course... 200 yards... The two victims have been taken from the front of the Humungus machine and something else is in their place... MAX sees that it is the FERAL KID, lashed there - upside down... He throws the wheel, sending the vehicle into a slide, spinning clear of the Humungus machine. The Lone Wolf vehicle spins around... Thud! into the bikes of TWO MARAUDERS flanking WEZ. The third - a MOHAWK BIKER - follows WEZ, As soon as MAX has the Lone Wolf machine under control, he guns the two engines un,s is off after WEZ. He hits \n171. HUMUNGUS MACHINE. DAY. 171.

We are upside down as we rocket along the curving, undulating, highway, through a flock of birds... towards a puddle of water... as the water splashes on the lens... \n", "test1_input": "QUIET MAN How? What did they do? \nMAX It was quick. The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away. NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps air into his lungs. MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO: \nMAX I saw a man in trouble. I brought him in.

BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing. PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX: \nPAPPAGALLO I don't know who you are, or what happened. But if you had a contract, it was with him. And it died with him. PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the crowd, back towards his tent.

A pair of manacles are locked around MAX'S wrists. WARRIOR WOMAN climbs to a big crossbow mounted above the causeway. The BUTCHER drops her knife and grabs her long bow. The rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety. PAPPAGALLO mans the flame thrower. Others draw their bows. The FERAL KID follows the rabbit down a hole at the foot of the battlement. As MAX climbs to a position on the battlements near WARRIOR WOMAN and PAPPAGALLO he sees that the MARAUDER HORDE has gathered in all its glory. \n46. NO MAN'S LAND.

As the advance guard approaches through the dust and heat haze we see that SIX NEAR NAKED AND BLOODIED PEOPLE are lashed to the front of the vehicles.

The TOADIE, a comically dressed Marauder perched on the top of the Humungus vehicle, waves his arms. The Marauders cut their motors... Silence. The TOADIE announces: \nTOADIE Greetings from the Lord Humungus The Warrior of the Wasteland! The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller. Camera cranes up to the HUMUNGUS as he rises in his seat. His voice is amplified by two loudspeakers mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle: Sc. 50, Cont... \nHUMUNGUS I am told you wish to take the gasolene out of the wasteland...

KAYLA You should turn it off now. Cornelius turns and stares at her. 
CORNELIUS I should what? 
(BLINKING) Oh. I guess that's... I guess that's a good idea. He turns off the electricity. 1coNTTN IRD 1 
CONTINUED: 
KAYLA You two have always hated each other. You should fight. The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth. The two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill you'd expect from two scientists. 
INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER - MOMENTS LATER 
Kayla steps into the room. Logan sits slumped motionless in the electric chair. She detaches the copper halo. The skin beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal. Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment and exhales. She unfastens the titanium manacles. Logan is still unconscious. Kayla shakes him gently. 
KAYLA Hey. Wake up. Logan opens his eyes. He is clearly disoriented, as if waking from a long coma. He stares up at Kayla. KAYLA (cont'd) Are you okay? Logan stares at her, groggy and confused. KAYLA (cont'd) Do you understand what I'm saying? 
(BEAT) Do you remember me? In one blinding motion, Logan snatches Kayla by the throat and roughly pulls her to him. She does not resist. 
LOGAN I would have done anything for you. 
KAYLA Please... 
LOGAN Do you hear me? Anything. (r0NTTNTTF.T)1 
CONTINUED: 
KAYLA Please... Creed's killing your friend. 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Victor Creed holds Hines against the cell wall with one hand. Her feet kick in the air as she struggles. He splits her blouse down the middle with a long black talon. 
VICTOR CREED I've always had a thing for human chicks. You're all so soft and helpless. 
HINES No... 
VICTOR CREED Maybe it's time I did a little surgery on you, Doctor. 
LOGAN (O.S.) The woman said no. Creed turns his head and sees Logan and Kayla standing in the doorway. He grins and tosses Hines aside. She crashes into the wall and slides to the floor, dazed. 
VICTOR CREED (to Logan) Starting to think you're addicted to pain. You keep coming back for more. Snikt ! 
LOGAN This is the end.

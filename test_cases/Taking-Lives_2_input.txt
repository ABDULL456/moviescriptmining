FADE IN: 
INT. BUS STATION - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO 
Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16, enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe. 
MARTIN 
Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to Montreal please? 
CASHIER 
Pardon? 
MARTIN 
I need a ticket to Montreal. 
CASHIER 
Montreal? 
MARTIN 
Yes, sir.     Please. 
CASHIER 
Forty-three dollars. Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The DRIVER loading bags. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him, offers a hand. Martin shakes. 
DAN 
Dan Soulsby. 
MARTIN 
Martin.     Nice to meet you. 
DAN 
Where you heading to? 
MARTIN 
Away from here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers Martin one. 
MARTIN 
Pisswater. 
DAN 
At least it's cold pisswater. Here's to getting away. They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas. BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING. Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks. 
DAN 
That was bad. (bummed) It's gonna take all day to get another bus here. Martin sighs, looks out the window. 
WHAT MARTIN SEES 
A car rental place. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket. 
MARTIN 
You have a license? 
DAN 
Had one.    They took it away. 
MARTIN 
I got one.   Let's go. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.

It certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the struggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever and it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering the courtyard. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER aims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles with the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against it. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
A seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body on the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit. They hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes down the door and they run in. 
83	INT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHT 
SARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have seen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is there and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him only moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks feverishly around the room. She spots a door. 
SARAH: That's the only way he could have gone! 
She runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow. 
SARAH: No. I have to face him alone! 
DIDYMUS: But, my lady ... 
He is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start trying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body against it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side. 
HOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ... 
She puts her finger to his lips. 
SARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives? 
HOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ... 
SARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ... 
She looks down at his empty belt. 
SARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process. 
HOGGLE: I don't care if I never sees another treasure again! 
SARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind. 
She slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand. He is overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure. 
HOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me. 
SARAH: Jareth doesn't know everything. 
She leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans. 
SARAH: Take care of him, Didymus. 
DIDYMUS: I'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life! 
The GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses against the door even harder. 
LUDO: Ludo ... too! 
She runs to the other door and stops to look back at them. 
SARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.

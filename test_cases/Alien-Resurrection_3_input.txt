Engulfed in flame, losing its grip -- 
THE BETTY 
Going too fast -- Call can't control it 
VRIESS 
Kill thrust! Now! 
Call does. 
ANGLE: THE BETTY 
Skids, skids, throwing up enormous debris.  It hits another wooded area 
RIPLEY 
is thrown bodily into the windshield -- 
THE BETTY 
mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt. 
As soon as they've recovered, Call throws off her seatbelt. 
CALL Is everbody all right-? 
JOHNER 
Where're you going? 
Call opens the hatch. 
CALL 
To make sure that thing is really dead 
Its giant face LUNGES down at her, piston tongue shooting out. 
It has charred black skin -- in some places that skin has fallen off and wet pink flesh shows through. 
Call drops to the floor, the tongue just missing her.  Johner scrambles for his gun as 
Ripley drags her out of the way. 
AS quickly as it came, the head lurches back out. 
JOHNER 
I think it's gone! 
VRIESS 
No, it's waiting for us to come out! 
Can we fly? 
VRIESS 
We can't fucking crawl! 
RIPLEY 
It's gone. 
Call looks at her. 
CALL 
Are you sure? 
JOHNER 
Good!  Great! 
CALL 
No... 
Call grabs a grenade launcher. 
CALL 
I've got to stop it. 
VRIESS 
Call 
CALL 
That thing is thirty minutes old!  In a few hours it'll grow up.  If it reaches a place with people... 
She heads for the door but Ripley is on her way.  They exchange a look. 
RIPLEY 
You'll never catch it. 
Call tosses her the grenade launcher. 
CUT TO: EXT.  BETTY - MOMENTS LATER 
The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow. 
Ripley comes out the top.  She looks around her, sees the tracks in the snow. 
Huge, loping.  She jumps.down off the ship. 
And runs. 
Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see. 
She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she reaches a cliff face, and looks out on: 
A CITY. 
Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's just before  the horizon. 
The newborn RISES in front of Ripley, STRIKES her before she has a chance to aim her weapon. 
Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying. 
The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, FIRE 
The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get off another shot, it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS, the launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER, Call at the controls. aiming right  for the newborn. 
It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head, it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning out, as Call comes around for another shot. 
Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes at her.  KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF -- 
She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface and she takes her hand, SLAMS her fingers into the smooth rock face like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase. 
ANGLE: CALL 
SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face Call herself. 
ANGLE: RIPLEY'S 
Bloody and torn, it SMASHES into the rockface, as she climbs back to the top 
ANGLE: THE NEWBORN

Overlapping: 
MILLY What? 
SHEP When? 
MILLY Why? 
FRANK September. 
Beat.   Then: 
MILLY But what for? 
FRANK What for? Because we've always wanted to. Because the kids are still young. Because it's beautiful. Shep, you tell her. 
SHEP ...It's a great city. 
Milly glances nervously at Shep. 
MILLY When did you make this decision? 
APRIL Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember. We just suddenly decided to go, that's all. 
MILLY About a week ago, and you tell us now! 
APRIL We had to get used to the idea. 
Shep forces himself across the room and hands the Wheelers their drinks. 
SHEP So, what's the deal, Frank? You get a job over there, or what? 
FRANK (smiles) No. Not exactly. 
SHEP What do you mean, `not exactly?' 
APRIL Frank won't be doing any kind of a job, because I will. 
SHEP (to Frank) And what are you going to do? 
FRANK I'm going to study... and I'm going to read and... I suppose I'm going to finally figure out what I want to do with my life. 
SHEP ...While she supports you? 
Beat. 
FRANK Yes. While she supports me...   At least in the beginning. 
APRIL You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and those places. 
FRANK The cost of living is dirt cheap compared to here, so we should be all right. 
Beat. 
APRIL The truth is we just need something different. (MORE) 
APRIL (CONT'D) We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by. 
MILLY Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I mean it; it really sounds wonderful. We'll certainly miss you, though - won't we, sweetie? Golly. 
SHEP Sure. 
MILLY Paris.   Wow. 
A   silence.   Shep's face. 
INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 
Milly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown.   She is brushing her hair.

BEN Hey! 
Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket. 
BEN (CONT'D) (softening) Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh. 
He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses the sheet. 
WENDY (without pulling the sheet down, but nicely) Good-night dad. 
BEN Good night kiddo. 
Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face. 
INT. HOOD BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed, looking at Elena. 
ELENA (without opening her eyes) You're staring at me. 
BEN I wasn't star-- 
ELENA I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens. 
BEN That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him. 
ELENA I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok? 
BEN Why shouldn't she be? 
Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry. 
BEN (CONT'D) (pause) Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our... 
ELENA So maybe you'll come too? 
BEN Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them. 
ELENA It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you. 
BEN Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and -- 
ELENA -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision -- 
BEN Elena. 
Silence. 
ELENA (sighing) Sleep in the study? Please. 
Ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the door. 
BEN Good night. 
ELENA Good night. 
INT. WENDY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Wendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then off. 
EXT. MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY 
A nondescript, cleanly "modern" building. Engraved on the doors: "Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage - Established 1964" 
INT. SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY 
Ben, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties, unctuously handsome. 
BEN But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it? Well -- and I hope I'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more. As the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. This is why I suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation. 
The aging boss nods agreement. 
SHACKLEY (more or less mumbling) Brilliant, brilliant. 
George Clair just grins. 
INT. BEN HOOD'S OFFICE. DAY 
Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway.

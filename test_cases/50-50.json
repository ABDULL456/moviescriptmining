{"train": "50/50 (I'M WITH CANCER) \nWritten by \nWill Reiser \nFADE IN: \nOPENING TITLE SEQUENCE \nEXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY \nIt's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens. \nEXT. BUS STOP - DAY \nA BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers. \nWe follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL. \nINT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY \nAdam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. \nAdam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. \nAdam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine. \nRECEPTIONIST Can I help you? \nADAM I have an appointment. \nRECEPTIONIST Name? \nADAM Adam Schwartz. \nThe Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again. \nAnnoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing. \nADAM (CONT'D) (CONFUSED) Um, am I supposed to go somewhere? \nWith her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area. \nADAM (CONT'D) Oh, should I go sit? \nThe Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine. \nAdam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time, Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out: \nRECEPTIONIST Adam Schwartz. \nAdam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else there. Again the receptionist calls out again - \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) Adam Schwartz. \nADAM Yeah, that's me. \nRECEPTIONIST Follow me. \nThe Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown. \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) Put this on. \nADAM Do I need to take off all my clothes? \nThe Receptionist stares blankly at Adam. \nADAM (CONT'D) I'll figure it out. \nThe Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right. \nAdam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse. \nNURSE JOANNE Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you. \nAdam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin. \nADAM You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend? \nNURSE JOANNE (LAUGHS) Cotton. You're funny. \nJoanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line. \nNURSE JOANNE (CONT'D) Now I'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine. You think you can do that? \nFrustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head. \nADAM (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Sorry. \nAdam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself. \nAdam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck. \nRACHEL Mmmmm. \nRachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair. Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair. She holds it up. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Oh my god. \nADAM What? \nRACHEL I think you have a gray hair. \nADAM Really? \nRACHEL I'm gonna pull it out. \nADAM No! Don't touch it. \nAdam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel rolls back to sleep. \nINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAdam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It is in fact a gray hair. He smiles. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair. He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product. \nINT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER \nSETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: \"Let's put the Christ back in Christmas.\" \nOverweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. \nJust then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment. \nSETH Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it? \nThe mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. \nAdam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave to Adam. \nANDREW Hey Adam. \nADAM (SEEMS ANNOYED) Hey Andrew. \nANDREW Sorry about the noise last night. \nAdam shrugs as if to say \"what the fuck?\" Andrew and Missy giggle as they get into their car. \nINT. SETH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nAdam gets into the car. \nSETH Yo. \nADAM Yo. \nSETH ...What's that smell? (SNIFFS ADAM) Are you wearing perfume? \nADAM No. \nSETH Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias. \nADAM (SMELLS HIMSELF) I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachel's. \nSETH For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis. \nAdam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on. \nADAM Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air. \nSeth ignores Adam and turns up the music. \nADAM (CONT'D) (ANNOYED) Seriously, my allergies are flaring up. It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire. \nSeth spots a GROUP OF SECOND GRADERS with their TEACHER assembled by the entrance. \nSETH (CONT'D) Looks like my group is here. \nSeth slaps on a button that reads \"DOCENT\" and rushes off to greet the students. \nSETH (CONT'D) See you guys later. \nPhil turns to Adam. \nPHIL How's the Origins exhibit coming along? \nADAM We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic. \nPHIL I'm counting on you not to screw up. (looks into Adam's eyes) You're the only one I can trust. (BEAT) (MORE) \nPHIL (CONT'D) The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors...We're a dying art Adam. \nPhil stares into Adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity. It's incredibly awkward. \nADAM Phil? \nPHIL Yeah? \nADAM I should probably get to work. \nPHIL That's probably a good idea. \nPhil looks at the clock - 10 a.m. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I think I'm gonna go to lunch. \nPhil wanders off. \nINT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - LATER \nAdam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices. \nADAM Greg. What are you doing? \nGREG It's a velociraptor. \nADAM Where did it come from? \nGREG The dinosaur exhibit. (off Adam's look) Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...People love dinosaurs. \nAdam cringes in frustration. \nADAM Greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it. \nGreg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam. \nSeth leads his tour of second graders. He speaks like a tour guide at Universal Studios. \nSETH Coming up here on our left is the \"Origins of Man\" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it. (SPOTS ADAM) Adam! \nAdam looks up. He hates this part of his job. \nSETH (CONT'D) Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum. \nAdam gives a reluctant wave. \nADAM Hey kids. \nSETH (TO ADAM) Why don't you tell us what we're looking at. \nADAM (BEGRUDGINGLY) This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago... \nIn excitement, the kids move in for a closer look. Unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails. \nADAM (CONT'D) ...these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans... \nKID 1 touches the Cro Magnon father. Still talking, Adam steps in and moves Kid 1's hand off. \nADAM (CONT'D) ...What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick. \nKID 1 (TO SETH) This is lame! I thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs. \nGREG (TO ADAM) See, I told you. \nDamage control. Seth points to a life sized NEANDERTHAL MAN holding a spear. \nSETH (IN EXCITEMENT) Who wants to hear about the caveman? \nSeth picks up the spear and pretends to charge Adam. \nADAM Can't you just cut it out of me? \nDR. ROSS Yes, that is an option. But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. Cutting it out now would be risky. \nADAM Well what are my chances of beating this? \nDr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but. \nDR. Ross Listen, you're in good hands. The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...Let me do the worrying. Alright? \nDr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) Maybe you should talk to someone. \nDr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the \"Mount Sinai Psychology Group\". \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) We have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital. They specialize in cases...in these...sort of matters. They'll be able to help you. \nNot knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch, looks back to Adam, and moves to the door. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) Hang in there champ. \nINT. SAN DIEGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING \nCLOSE ON a computer screen: \n\"Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma. Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation offer negligible success rates. Surgical resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery: Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death. 2 Year survival rate: 50%. If tumor metastasizes systemically, 2 year survival rate: 0%.\" \nAdam sits staring at the screen. This is not good. \nThe LIBRARIAN, a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the shoulder. \nLIBRARIAN Hey bro, time's up. \nStartled. Adam looks up at the librarian. \nADAM Can I have just a few more minutes? \nLIBRARIAN Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit. (EMBARRASSED) Rules. \nThe librarian motions to the LONG LINE of mostly HOMELESS CUSTOMERS waiting to use the computer. \nINT. BUS - EVENING \nAdam sits deep in thought. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nThe bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a deep breath... \nINT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAdam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen. \nRACHEL (O.S.) Adam? Is that you? \nAdam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her. God she looks sexy. Rachel turns - \nRACHEL (CONT'D) (in a Hungarian accent) Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made vegetarian goulash. \nLike a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another story. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) (still using accent) What is wrong? \nADAM Nothing. \nRACHEL (still using accent) Liar. \nThis is not going to be easy. \nADAM We need to talk. \nRachel drops the accent. This seems serious. \nRACHEL Why? What's going on? \nADAM I had a doctor's appointment today. \nRACHEL (WORRIED) What kind of doctor's appointment? \nAdam has no idea what to say. \nADAM Have you ever seen the movie \"Beaches\"? \nRACHEL You mean with Bette Midler? \nArt drops the cat and it bolts out the door. \nEDITH So what's for dinner? \nINT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER \nEveryone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at. \nRACHEL If I had known you were coming I would have made something else. \nEDITH I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son... (looks at her plate) So this isn't meat? \nRACHEL No it's called sei-tan. \nADAM It's made of wheat gluten. \nEdith looks more confused. \nEDITH But it's not meat. \nRACHEL No, but it has a texture just like meat. \nEdith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash. \nEDITH (INSINCERE) Mmmmm. It's Good. \nEdith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art. \nEDITH (CONT'D) Art, take your pills. \nArt picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow. \nEDITH (CONT'D) Swallow. \nAs Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel. \nEDITH (CONT'D) So? Did you set a date? \nRACHEL (CONFUSED) A date? \nEDITH (TO ADAM) Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was? Schlepping around in the heat like that. Plus the bugs and the gnats. \nADAM (whispers to Rachel) What is she talking about? \nEDITH And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert? \nRACHEL (whispers to Adam) She thinks we're getting married. \nADAM Mom. We're not getting married. \nEDITH Oh thank god. (TO RACHEL) No offense. (TO ADAM) So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here. \nNot knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news... \nADAM Have you ever seen \"Terms of Endearment\"? \nRACHEL Oh jesus Adam, just tell her. \nEDITH Tell me what? \nADAM Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm. \nEDITH Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic. \nADAM Mom, just promise me. Okay? \nEDITH I promise...You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon. \nHere goes nothing. \nADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. \nEDITH What? \nADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. \nEDITH (TO RACHEL) What is he saying? \nADAM (takes a deep breath) I have cancer. \nEDITH Cancer? What do you mean you have cancer? \nADAM I - HAVE - CANCER. \nEDITH I don't understand. \nADAM What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee? \nSeth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN behind him. \nSETH (quietly to Adam) Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - \"I have these things and I want the world to see them.\" \nGreg looks up at the menu of endless options. \nGREG What about that frozen drink, what's that like? \nBARISTA (ENTHUSIASTIC) The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute heaven. \nGREG I don't know. Does it have a lot of sugar? \nADAM We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car? \nSeth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts. \nSETH Why are you in such a rush? \nAdam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations. \nADAM Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place? \nGreg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps. \nADAM (CONT'D) I don't believe it. Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning. \nSETH Relax. We have plenty of time. \nADAM No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite. \nSETH What the fuck is wrong with you? \nADAM (QUIETLY) I have cancer. \nSETH (LAUGHS) Yeah right. \nADAM I'm serious. \nSETH Get the fuck out of here. You have cancer? \nPeople in line look at Seth. \nADAM Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement. \nSETH (QUIETLY) When did this happen? \nADAM Yesterday. They found a tumor in my spine. \nSETH Who? \nADAM What do you mean who? \nSETH Who found the tumor? \nADAM Lewis and Clark...The doctors found it. \nSETH When were you going to tell me? \nADAM I'm telling you now. \nSETH If I had cancer I'd tell you right away. \nADAM What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up. \nSETH Holy shit! \nSeth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his face...he quickly shakes it off. \nSETH (CONT'D) Okay, let's relax here. (BEAT) I think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side. \nADAM The bright side of what? \nSETH (EMPHATICALLY) This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. This is it. This is your time to live it up. (A BEAT) Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get? \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nRachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. In Adam's hand is the business card with \"Mount Sinai Psychology Group\" written on it. He finds the office and knocks on the half opened door. \nThe office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about. \nKATIE Now, why do you say that? \nADAM I don't know, it was a bad joke. \nKATIE But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel. \nKatie is losing Adam. \nKATIE (CONT'D) In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside. \nAdam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy. \nKATIE (CONT'D) So today what I want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy. \nKatie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion. \nADAM Huh? \nKATIE I want you to lay back and close your eyes. \nAdam looks down at the coffee stained couch. \nADAM Lay here? \nKATIE Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go. \nADAM Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl? \nKATIE Another joke? \nADAM (SHRUGS) Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny. \nKATIE Ssshhhhh... \nKatie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention. \nHe finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain. \nKATIE (CONT'D) Close your eyes and relax. Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer. \nAdam closes his eyes. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nRACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. No peeking. \nINT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAdam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed. \nADAM I can't believe you got me a present. (BEAT) Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing? \nRACHEL (O.S.) Even better. \nADAM What is it? \nRACHEL (O.S.) Keep your eyes closed. \nADAM You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted. \nRACHEL (O.S.) You're not adopted. \nADAM Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was. \nRachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam. \nRACHEL Okay. Open your eyes. \nAdam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Surprise! \nAdam stares in confusion. \nADAM (DISAPPOINTED) What is it? \nRACHEL It's Noodle. \nADAM It's so small. What do you do with it? \nRACHEL (ANNOYED) Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process. \nADAM Why, did it go to medical school? \nRACHEL (PISSED) I thought you'd be happy... \nSUSAN Eat nothing but green foods. \nADAM Like a specific kind of green food? \nSUSAN No, any green food. It works, my sister's friend survived lung cancer. \nCUT TO: \nAdam stands with TED. \nTED (SUSPICIOUS) So what kind of cancer do you have? \nADAM Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas. \nTED Never heard of it. \nADAM It's pretty rare. \nTED Yeah well, you don't look sick. \nADAM Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. \nTED (SUSPICIOUS) Huh. \nCUT BACK TO: \nAdam with Susan again... \nSUSAN There's spinach, zucchini, broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi, Zucchini, \nADAM I think you already said zucchini. \nSUSAN (ANNOYED) Zucchini... \nFrom across the room, Adam and Rachel lock eyes. He gives her a defeated look, as if to say \"help me.\" Rachel gives a sympathetic smile. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Are you paying attention? \nADAM (caught off guard) Uh huh. \nSUSAN Cause I'm only trying to help save your life. \nFrom across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile. \nCUT TO: \nAdam is talking with EDDIE. \nEDDIE (SECRETLY) There's this guy on the beach who injects oxygen into your blood. \nADAM Is that legal? \nEDDIE No, but it's totally safe. \nCUT BACK TO: \nAdam with Susan... \nSUSAN ...Brussel Sprouts, Turnip greens, Asparagus, Celery, Cabbage, Okra, Honeydew Melon, Limes, Green bell peppers, green chiles... \nCUT TO: \nJenny cries hysterically as Seth consoles her. \nJENNY (CRYING) I can't believe that he has cancer. \nSETH I know, it's crazy. \nJENNY I've seen him every day for the past two years and I've never once made an effort to talk to him. \nSETH Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him. \nJENNY Oh what does it matter? It's too late. \nJenny walks away crying. Seth follows after her. \nSETH Wait. It's not too late. \nCUT TO: \nAdam makes himself a drink at the bar. Greg approaches. \nGREG Hey Adam. \nADAM (less than excited) Hey Greg. \nNEIGHBOR Nice dog. \nOnce the neighbor is out of sight- \nADAM Will you please just finish. \nThe dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house. After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back inside. \nINT. ADAM'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAdam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes. He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps it tight against her chest. \nRACHEL Hold me. \nADAM (UNDER BREATH) Mother fucker. \nThe two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's body. A beat. \nADAM (CONT'D) Do you...want to move in? \nRACHEL Do you want me to? \nADAM I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo starting... \nRachel turns to Adam. \nADAM (CONT'D) You're here all the time anyway. \nRACHEL (SMILES) Okay. \nRachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest. \nADAM (WHISPERS) You wanna have sex? \nRACHEL (ASLEEP) In the morning. \nEXT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MORNING \nEdith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop as it parks in the last empty space. \nEdith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before they realize Art is still in the car. \nEDITH Art come on. \nART I'm coming. \nArt, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car. \nEDITH We're late. \nEdith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car. \nINT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER \nEdith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. The service led by RABBI JACOBS (75) has already begun. \nEdith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row. Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since the service has begun - getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people. The USHER approaches. \nUSHER Please take your seats. \nThe Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back. \nEDITH What about those seats up there in the front? \nUSHER The service has begun. \nEDITH Please. My son has cancer. \nAdam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam couldn't be more uncomfortable. \nUSHER Please, follow me. \nThe usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through. \nEdith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by. \nEDITH (QUIETLY) Sorry, my son has cancer. \nAdam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past. \nADAM (QUIETLY) Hi. Nice to see you. \nINT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE. ATRIUM - LATER \nEdith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing and conversing after the service. ROSE (60) approaches. \nBack on Alan Alda. \nALAN ALDA (CONT'D) Toward helping yourself begin to feel in control again...On behalf of all the great folks at Mount Sinai Hospital, I'd like to thank you for your time...make it a great day. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nA small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching the video. The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around baffled by both the video and the clapping. \nGEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the room. \nGEORGE Adam Schwartz. \nAdam stands. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Come with me my baby. \nAdam follows George into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward. \nWalking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms. \nA sick, fat, BALD ELDERLY WOMAN coughs as she passes. Adam winces in disgust. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) This way my baby. \nGeorge leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room. \nINT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER \nAdam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years. Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like state helps Adam relax. \nAdam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator. Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall. Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices. \nMITCH That's Henry. \nADAM Is he okay? \nMITCH He's always like that. \nADAM (TERRIFIED) Is that going to happen to me? \nMITCH Best not worry about these things. \nALAN (84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch chimes in. \nALAN (TO ADAM) Want a hit? \nAdam looks down to see that Alan is holding a ONE HITTER full of weed. \nMITCH It makes it all a little easier to handle. \nADAM (PARANOID) What if someone sees us? \nALAN Don't be such an old man. Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do. \nAdam reluctantly takes a hit. \nMITCH How old are you? \nADAM Twenty-five. \nALAN You're lucky. Life only gets worse anyway. \nMITCH Alan, stop it. (TO ADAM) Don't listen to him, he's just messing with you. \nALAN No I'm not. (TO ADAM) It's all downhill from here. Trust me. First your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink. You'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal Miata. Then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up. \nMITCH You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time. \nALAN (TO ADAM) I'm just being realistic. You want some advice? \nADAM Not really. \nALAN Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be. \nADAM I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better. \nAlan and Mitch laugh. \nALAN (TO MITCH) I like this kid. (TO ADAM) I'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma. Pleased to meet you. \nMITCH Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate cancer. \nADAM Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas. \nALAN What the fuck is that?...Sounds like the greek dish I had for lunch. \nKatie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical. \nKATIE I want you to do some homework. Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy. They should help you get started. \nKatie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it. \nWE PUSH IN ON THE LIST OF BOOKS: \nINT. BOOKSTORE. SELF HELP SECTION - DAY \nWE PULL OUT ON THE LIST OF BOOKS: \nAdam and Seth browse through shelves of books. Seth is reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's list. \nSETH (IN EXCITEMENT) \"Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness\"... You're actually going to read this shit? This guy is a fucking tool. \nSeth ditches the New Age book and picks up one on Mardi Gras. \nSETH (CONT'D) Let's go to Mardi Gras! \nADAM Why would we go to Mardi Gras? \nSETH Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest. \nADAM I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it. \nSETH We need to go see the world. \nADAM This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here. \nSETH (FRUSTRATED) Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste. \nAdam takes the book from Seth's hands and puts it down. \nADAM I'm not going anywhere. \nFrom across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE (30), an attractive employee stacking books. \nSETH Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I will. \nSeth yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire. \nSETH (CONT'D) Excuse me. \nCLAIRE Yes, how can I help you? \nSETH I'm looking to buy a few books - \nSeth hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads. \nCLAIRE Oh. (CONCERNED) Are these for...I'm sorry it's none of my business. \nSETH No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam. \nSeth nods towards Adam across the room. \nSETH (CONT'D) He's pretty sick. \nClaire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying puppy. Adam looks on in confusion. \nCLAIRE How awful. \nSETH Yeah. Cancer, not cool. \nCLAIRE Poor guy. \nSETH I know it's been really hard. \nClaire leans in. \nCLAIRE It's bad isn't it? \nSETH Honestly? (FEIGNING SADNESS) Sometimes I just wish it was me instead of him...to relieve some of the burden, you know? I just...I just want to help. \nINT. BOOKSTORE - LATER \nAdam and Seth exit the bookstore. They pass Claire who gives Seth a big smile followed by the \"call me\" motion. \nADAM What just happened? \nSETH (TO ADAM) I'll tell you what happened. Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train. \nINT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY \nAdam and Seth smoke a joint as they watch \"Planet Earth\" on a brand new 50\" flat screen TV. There are a dozen oversized boxes marked \"Rachel\" scattered throughout the house. \nKATIE (EXCITED) Adam! This is fantastic. \nAdam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response. \nKATIE (CONT'D) You know if you're interested, there are some more advanced forms of therapy that I think could be really useful. \nADAM Sure, if you think it'll help. \nINT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY \nAdam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus. \nThe class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid. \nSETH (quietly to Adam) What are they laughing at? \nADAM (quietly to Seth) Just go with it. \nSeth and Adam laugh along with the others. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (to Adam and Seth) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter. (MORE) \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life. \nThe Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth - and we laugh at that truth. \nThe Laughter Therapist closes his eyes. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) So let us share. Adam, why don't you tell us what brings you here? \nAdam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We're all friends here in the Laughter Pagoda. \nADAM I, ah, have cancer. \nThe entire class laughs hysterically. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share - \nBEVERLY Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times. \nThe class laughs. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST Paul, share, \nPAUL My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister. \nThe class laughs. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST JIM - \nJIM (GLUM) I owe two men eight grand by Friday. \nThe class laughs. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST SETH - \nSETH My best friend is a giant pussy. \nThe class laughs. \nADAM My best friend's favorite band is Abba. \nEveryone laughs except for Seth. \nSETH (DEFENSIVE) When I was 12. \nLAUGHTER THERAPIST (HYSTERICAL) Abba! Wonderful. I love it. Seth laugh. \nINT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - DAY \nTIME LAPSE: Adam stares at himself in the mirror. His health slowly deteriorates. Hair begins to fall out. His face thins. \nSUPER: JULY \nFADE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - DAY \nAdam, Alan and Mitch sit in the corridor of the Cancer Ward. Adam is wearing a ski hat to cover his balding head. \nAdam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives. The car is filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc. Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road. \nKATIE Sorry about the mess. \nAdam picks up a copy of \"Organizing Your Way to Success,\" which is lying on the floor. \nADAM I think you should ask for a refund. \nKATIE I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached. \nADAM Yeah, I can see. \nChanging the subject. \nKATIE So you don't drive? \nADAM Nope. \nKATIE But you have a license? \nADAM Nope. (BEAT) I actually failed my test. \nKATIE No! \nADAM (EMBARRASSED) It's true. \nKATIE But, I thought you can re-take the test. \nADAM Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I didn't. \nKatie stares at Adam in shock. \nKATIE What did you do? \nADAM I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...Into the Balboa cactus garden. \nKATIE The garden with all the endangered plants? \nADAM They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane. \nKatie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself. \nKATIE I'm sorry. That's terrible. \nUnable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature. \nADAM (ABRUPT) Stop the car. \nKatie looks at Adam nervously. \nKATIE Why what's wrong? \nADAM Just stop the car. \nKatie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage and gets out. \nKATIE What are you doing? \nADAM I can't handle all this mess. \nAdam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car. \nKATIE Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner. \nAdam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath. \nADAM You can drive. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER \nAdam and Katie arrive at Adam's house. \nADAM Thanks for the ride... \nAdam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie. \nADAM (CONT'D) Do you want to come in. For a beverage? Or something? \nKATIE It probably wouldn't be very professional of me. \nADAM Come on, I'll let you analyze my Id. \nKatie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that Adam is more than a patient. \nKATIE Uh, okay. But I can't stay long. \nADAM Is it all gone? \nFor the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look. \nSuddenly, Rachel walks through the front door. \nRACHEL (O.C.) Adam? \nFeeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave. \nKATIE I should probably be going. \nRachel enters the kitchen. \nRACHEL Adam? \nADAM Finally. Where have you been? \nRACHEL (MAD) I hope I'm not interrupting. \nADAM Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my therapist. \nRACHEL (SUSPICIOUS) This is your therapist? \nKATIE Please, call me Katie. \nRACHEL (SUSPICIOUS) OK. Katie. What are you doing here? \nADAM She drove me home. Ring a bell? \nRACHEL Ugh. Shit. (SWEET/NERVOUS) Thank you so much for doing that. Life's been a little crazy lately, which I'm sure Adam has told you all about. I love those shoes. \nKATIE Thanks... \nAwkward silence. The tension is thick. \nKATIE (CONT'D) I'm going to go. I'll see you at our next session Adam. \nKatie leaves. \nADAM Where have you been? \nRACHEL I was at the gallery. \nADAM (PISSED) You were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago. \nRACHEL I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place. (off Adam's look) (MORE) \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that. You know this is a hard time for me. \nADAM You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs. \nRACHEL (DEFENSIVE) I'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around! \nADAM And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility. \nRACHEL And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for? \nADAM This. Us. \nRACHEL I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife. \nADAM You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again. \nRACHEL I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on. \nRachel begins to cry. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? The past few months have been hard on me too. It's not always about you. \nADAM (RELENTS) I know. \nAdam tenderly wraps his arms around Rachel. \nA beat. \nRACHEL Why are you so good? \nADAM You're my Yam. \nINT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME NIGHT \nRachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops. \nRACHEL What's wrong? \nSETH Jen giving me a blow job? \nADAM No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago... I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory. \nAdam stares out at the ocean. Reality check. \nSETH You okay? \nAdam throws his beer bottle into the ocean. \nADAM I can't believe this is all actually happening. \nSETH The girl or the cancer? \nADAM Both. \nSETH It's some pretty fucked up shit. \nADAM You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel...granted that might not be so far off. (shakes his head) What a waste. \nSeth puts his arm around him. \nSETH We need to get you laid. \nADAM (ANNOYED) Don't you ever give up? \nSETH No. \nADAM Seriously, who's going to have sex with me? \nSETH Some girls are into it? \nADAM I look like Powder. (BEAT) Plus I have erectile dysfunction...temporary. I hope. \nSETH Then let's go get me laid. \nSeth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk. \nADAM I think I should drive. \nSETH You don't have a license. \nADAM You're drunk. \nSETH Do you even know how to drive? \nADAM How hard can it be? \nSETH Hard enough that you don't have a license. \nADAM (SOMBER) This might be my last chance. \nSETH Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!...Forget it, I give up. Drive. \nThe two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car. \nAdam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant statue of Neptune riding a sea horse. \nSETH (CONT'D) Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going? \nADAM What? I didn't see it. \nSETH That's what the mirrors are for. \nAdam pulls out of the parking lot. \nSETH (CONT'D) Turn right. \nADAM I know what I'm doing. \nAdam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way. \nSETH Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY! \nAn oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision. \nSETH (CONT'D) Adam! Turn the car around. \nADAM No. I'm driving and I want to go this way. \nAnother car swerves out of the way. \nSETH What the fuck is wrong with you? \nADAM For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal. \nADAM (COY) That's what you think. \nSuddenly Adam passes out. His head slams into the steering wheel. The Horn blares. \nKATIE Adam? Adam? Adam? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nSeth and Adam stagger into the building. \nINT. SETH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nAdam and Seth enter the dingy studio apartment - it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Adam scoops up some dust with his finger. \nSeth is unusually quiet. Both guys are being distant. Seth pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye contact as they undress. Adam climbs into bed. He notices a book called \"Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer\" on Seth's bedside table. The book is worn and has multiple book marks - indicating it's been read. Adam looks at Seth, he had him pegged all wrong. \nSeth claps his hands. The lights turn off. \nADAM Good night. \nSETH Night. \nLying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him. \nADAM (UNCOMFORTABLE) What are you doing? \nSETH Watching you sleep. \nADAM It's a little creepy. \nSETH I know. I can't help it. \nSeth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future. \nEXT. FOX MEADOW GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY \nSeth's car enters the Mall parking lot and parks. \nVOICE MALL OPERATOR (V.O.) You have 2 new messages. First message. \nA beep. \nRICHARD MATHESSON (V.O.) Hi Adam, this is Richard Mathesson, your family's estate lawyer. Your mother asked me to call. We need to talk about potential, ah, well just call me, there are some potential arrangements we need to work out. \nINT. MEN'S WEARHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam and Seth browse through racks of mens suits. Adam comes upon one he likes. The SALES CLERK approaches. \nSALES CLERK Sir can I help you with anything today? \nADAM (holds up suit) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral? \nSALES CLERK No, what you want is on level 3. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. REDWOOD FUNERAL HOME/CEMETERY - SAME DAY \nSeth's car drives up the long driveway of the Cemetery. \nVOICE MAIL OPERATOR (V.O.) Next message. \nA beep. \nDR. ROSS (V.O.) Adam, this is Dr. Ross. Good news, I was able to expedite the wait for your surgery. Your scheduled for tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with Dr. Lamb. Please call my office if you have any questions. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME/CEMETERY - LATER \nA MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds. \nMORTICIAN Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased. We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care...A funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so I ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you. \nSETH What about a Viking funeral? \nMORTICIAN (INTRIGUED) I'm not familiar. \nSETH (talking out of his ass) You know, we put him on a boat... cover it with...dirt and...branches...whatever you can find. We push it out...into the sea...or the ocean...and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire...And that's it. It's awesome. \nThe Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to dignify Seth with a reply. A beat. \nMORTICIAN (points to grave plot) Here you are, the Schwartz family plot. \nAdam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones. Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we: \nADAM They're great, thank you. \nKatie sits on the bed next to Adam. \nKATIE So how you doing? \nADAM I'm a little freaked out. \nA small GERMAN ANESTHESIOLOGIST enters. There is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent. \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Hello Adam, I am the Anesthesiologist. I will give you shot to make you sleep. \nAdam holds Katie's hand. \nADAM Will you be here when I wake up? \nKATIE I'm not going anywhere. \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect. \nThe Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV. \nADAM (TERRIFIED) About how long? \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Relax, you will soon begin the sleeping. \nADAM Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I- \nJust like that, Adam's out cold. \nINT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - LATER \nAdam is face down on the operating table. Two Neurosurgeons, Dr. Lamb and DR. HENRY are in mid surgery. Alongside the two doctors are Nurse Wong and NURSE SCOTT. \nDR. HENRY I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake was a Buccaneer. \nDR. LAMB No he was a privateer. \nNURSE SCOTT I thought he was a pirate. \nDR. LAMB A pirate works for no one but himself. A privateer has a mandate from a government. \nDR. HENRY I thought that was a buccaneer. \nDR. LAMB No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned pirate. \nDR. HENRY Then what's a mercenary? \nDR. LAMB (FRUSTRATED) Nurse Wong. Will you Google it? \nStanding to the side of the operating table is the group of Med Students from earlier. They're still taking notes. \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEdith, Art and Seth sit impatiently watching the clock. Katie paces up and down the hall. Hours go by. Time can't seem to go by quick enough. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER \nDr. Lamb finds Edith, Katie and Seth in the waiting room. \nDR. LAMB We were successful in the extraction of the tumor. However, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude...there were some unforeseen complications. The bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated. We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle. We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk...He's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go. \nINT. HOSPITAL ICU - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. A NURSE comes in to change his IV. Adam slowly awakens. He is high on morphine. He stares, mesmerized by the nurse. \nADAM That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it? \nDr. Lamb enters. \nDR. LAMB Adam, I see you're awake. \nADAM I'm here. \nDR. LAMB How are you feeling? \nADAM I feel wonderful. \nDR. LAMB That would be the morphine. \nDr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in Adam's hand. \nDR. LAMB (CONT'D) I want you to push this little button any time you feel pain. It'll trigger the morphine. You think you can do that? \n", "test1_input": "INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nAdam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling. There is total silence. \nKATIE You're being awfully quiet today. Is everything okay? \nADAM I'm going to die aren't I? \nKATIE What are you talking about? \nADAM It's true. \nKATIE We don't know that. \nAdam sits up and looks at Katie. \nADAM I'm not getting any better. \nKATIE Don't say that, you're doing so well. \nADAM Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to live? \nKATIE (TOTALLY BAFFLED) What are you talking about? \nADAM Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do. \nKATIE This is really good Adam. Let it out. \nADAM Will you stop! (BEAT) I can't do this anymore. It doesn't matter. None of it. I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. That's it. \nKATIE This helplessness you're feeling is normal. These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life. (BEAT) Look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away...Talk to me. \nADAM I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore. (BEAT) I'm sorry. \nAdam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nAdam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner. \nINT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MORNING \nTIME LAPSE: Adam's stares at himself in the mirror. His health deteriorates even more. \nSUPER: NOVEMBER \nLooking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man. There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and he knows it. \nNoticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head. \nRachel enters and steps up on the scale. She examines herself in the mirror. \nADAM I need a new lint brush. \nRACHEL Okay, I'll pick one up. \nADAM And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday...The big one. \nRachel continues to examines her waist. \nRACHEL Am I getting fat? \nAdam stares at Rachel. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) What? \nADAM Are you listening to me? \nRACHEL (ANNOYED) Yes. \nADAM So you'll take me? \nRACHEL Of course. \nRachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall, smashing it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAdam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks unhinged. \nHe slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make room for Rachel's painting. \nAdam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored. \n", "test1_true": "Adam reads through a stack of unopened letters. He comes across a postcard from the Museum advertising \"Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY \nCLOSE ON: the \"Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man\" poster in the Museum's main entrance. \nAdam enters the museum and walks up to the sign. People stop and stare, stunned by Adam's gaunt appearance - like a ghost haunting the grounds. Adam carries a wide smile, he's overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job. \nINT. PHIL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nPhil and Adam sit in Phil's office. \nPHIL You look great. \nADAM Really? \nPHIL (INSINCERE) Yeah, look at you. \nADAM I want to come back to work. \nPHIL (IN DISBELIEF) You want to come back? Here? \nADAM What's so crazy about that? \nPHIL You could be anywhere right now, and this is that place? \nADAM Yeah. \nPHIL Are you sure that's a good idea? \nPhil is treading a fine line... \nPHIL (CONT'D) ...Given...your current health? \nADAM You said I look great. \nPHIL Yeah for a guy with cancer. \nAdam looks dejected. Phil feels bad, he went too far. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Alright, what the hell? I'd love to have you back. Let's be honest this place is falling apart without you. \nADAM Thank you Phil. \nPHIL (SYMPATHETICALLY ) So you're really okay? I mean, the cancer, is- \nADAM Oh it's really good. We've come to an understanding. It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and I let it. \nPhil, second-guessing his decision- \nPHIL Welcome back. \nINT. MUSEUM. POMPEII EXHIBIT - LATER \nSeth leads a tour of FOREIGN TOURISTS through the museum. He speaks as he did earlier - like a game show host. \nSETH And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit \"The Last Days Pompeii.\" Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city. \nSeth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama. \nSETH (CONT'D) This here is Adam, one of our curators. Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on? \nADAM (UPBEAT) Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like. \nAdam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror. People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model devours a villager. \nADAM (CONT'D) According to Pliny the Younger - \"You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world.\" \nThe tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles the group away. \nSETH Ok. Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon. \nSeth looks back at Adam like he's lost his mind. \nINT. MUSEUM. HALL - LATER \nThe sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the men's bathroom. A crowd of Museum guests walk past in horror. They look at each other in fear. The toilet flushes. Adam walks out. Everyone stares. Adam smiles in embarrassment. \nADAM (AWKWARD) I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs me. \nAdam walks back to the Pompeii exhibit. Phil approaches. \nPHIL You feeling okay? You don't look so good. \n", "test1_id": 1809, "test2_input": "ADAM Could be worse. Right? \nPhil notices the Pompeii exhibit. \nPHIL (STARTLED) Jesus! \nPhil feels terrible about what he's going to say next. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Listen Adam...I don't know how to say this... \nPhil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder. \nADAM Don't worry...I get it. You're a good guy. \nPHIL Come back when you're better. You know you'll always have a home here. \nINT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER \nDistraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in time. \nHe comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man. He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match. He continues down the hall towards the exit. \nEXT. SAN DIEGO BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON \nAdam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He looks like a raisin among grapes. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY \nAdam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch and then dials his phone. \nRACHEL (V.O.) Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay! \nAdam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back. \nADAM (SWEET) Hey, it's Adam. Where are you? Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today. So call me back. \nEnraged, Adam hangs up. \nADAM (CONT'D) Fuck! \nAdam picks up his phone and dials again. \nSETH (V.O.) Yoooooo. \nADAM Hey man, I need you to do me - \nSETH (V.O.) Not around. Leave a message. \nAdam hangs up and dials again. \nEDITH (O.S.) (YELLING) Hello, \nAdam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of regret runs through his body. \nADAM Hi mom. \nINT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER \nEdith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters. \nCUTE NURSE The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright? \nEDITH It's very cold in here. Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Conditioning? \nCUTE NURSE Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat. \nEDITH My son has cancer. \nCUTE NURSE (FEELS BAD) I'm sorry, really, if I could I would, but there's nothing I can do. \nAdam's pissed that his mother has just involved him. \nADAM (smiles to the Nurse) Don't worry about it. (Scowls at Edith) I'm fine. \nCUTE NURSE Are you sure? I could get you a blanket. \nADAM No, really, I'm okay. But thank you. \nEDITH I'd love a blanket. \nADAM (to the Cute Nurse) We're fine. \nCUTE NURSE Okay, but you let me know if you need anything. \nThe Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The Cute Nurse exits. \n", "test2_true": "Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her. \nEDITH (CONT'D) You feel warm. \nADAM I'm fine. \nEdith pulls some pills out her fanny pack. \nEDITH Take these. \nADAM (ANNOYED) You're like some kind of deranged pusher. \nEDITH Do you know what it's like to fear losing your son? No. You don't. When you have children of your own we can discuss it. Now take the pills. \nAdam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow. Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns away, Adam spits the pills into his hand. \nEdith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various degrees on the wall. \nAdam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Edith closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination. \nEDITH (CONT'D) (DISAPPROVING) Huh. \nADAM What? \nEDITH Oh nothing. \nADAM (ANNOYED) What? \nEDITH It's nothing, he went to a state college. \nADAM You're unbelievable. \nEDITH I just worry that you're not getting the best care possible. \nAdam can't take it anymore. \nADAM Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack? \nEDITH You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? You think I don't know what's best for you? I birthed you. You came out of me. I am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it. (Re: fanny pack) You don't like this, well I'm sorry. It's my own way of caring. \nADAM (SNAPS) Well stop! You're driving me crazy. With the comments and the pills every five minutes. Just stop. I'm not dad. I can take care of myself. \nEdith turns away, Adam's words hurt. \nADAM (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. \nEdith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek. \nEDITH Yes you did. I drive you crazy. \nAdam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder. \nADAM Mom. \nEdith turns to Adam helpless and scared. \nEDITH You're all I've got. Look at your father. \nWe see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose. \nEDITH (CONT'D) I've lost him. My true love, gone. I'm never going see him again, at least not in this life. (BEAT) He spent his whole life priding himself on his independence, always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch. (TO ART) You happy? You like shitting yourself? \nADAM Mom! \nEDITH He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. And then I had you, and that was even greater. So if I hover and threaten your independence, so what? You have a mother who loves you more than anything. Is that so awful? \nADAM No. It's not. \nAdam and Edith share a moment...Dr. Ross storms in the room carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed. \nDR. ROSS Sorry to keep you folks waiting. It's been one of those days...car got towed. Wife double parked it. \nAdam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The cancer's not responding to the chemo. \nDr. Ross places the MRI into the light box. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) As you can see...The tumor is continuing to grow here, along the nerve. \nAdam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but see nothing. \nADAM So what do we do? \nDR. ROSS We need to operate. If we don't remove it soon we risk metastasis. \n", "test2_id": 1810, "test3_input": "ADAM But you said surgery was too risky. \nDR. ROSS We're out of options. \nTears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand. \nEDITH But he's going to be okay, right? You're going to fix it. \nDr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother. \nDR. ROSS This surgery is no guarantee. The risks are tremendous. And, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that Adam, you'll never be able to walk again. \nAdam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand. \nADAM Does that mean...I can get handicap parking? \nAdam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across Edith's face. \nINT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nDistraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the smell of a home cooked meal. He walks through the house. \nINT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nHe stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel cooking. Rachel turns around. She's in high spirits. \nRACHEL Hey you. \nRachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on the cheek. \nADAM Smells good. \nRACHEL The girls and I are having a movie night. I somehow got suckered into cooking. (off Adam's look) Don't worry I left you some. \nAdam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces. \nSuddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She quickly types a reply. \nADAM (SUSPICIOUS) Who's that? \nRACHEL Susan. She wants to know what time I'm coming over. \nADAM (even more suspicious) That's what she just texted? (MORE) \nADAM (CONT'D) She wants to know what time you're going over to her house? \nRachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her cooking. \nRACHEL Uh huh. \nADAM Alright, well I'm gonna go lie down. \nRACHEL I might be out late so don't wait up. \nAdam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room. \nHe stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages. \nADAM (TO SELF) What the fuck? \nRachel enters the kitchen. \nRACHEL What are you doing? \nADAM Who's James? \nRACHEL My art partner. \nADAM (re: text message) He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night? (CONTINUES READING) Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine. (LOOKS UP) That's funny. It seems as though you've double booked yourself. \nRACHEL I can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that. \nADAM (READING PHONE) Oh, you just got another text from him. He says \"Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted... \nRachel reaches for the phone. Adam pulls away. \nRACHEL (FUMING) Give me back my phone. \nADAM (READING) \"Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon.\" (A BEAT) He seems sweet. \nRACHEL Adam, it's not what you think. \nADAM Well now how do you know what I'm thinking? \nRACHEL Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong. \n", "test3_true": "RACHEL Adam you're being ridiculous. \nADAM Am I? \nAdam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel naked, covered in red paint. \nADAM (CONT'D) What's this? \nAdam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of Rachel - all ridiculously artistic. \nADAM (CONT'D) And this? And this? And this? There are over a dozen naked photos of you in here. \nSuddenly the back door swings open. Oblivious, Seth enters. \nSETH Hey guys. \nAdam and Rachel say nothing. Seth can tell he just walked into some major shit. \nSETH (CONT'D) Bad time? \nAdam and Rachel say nothing. Seth takes a peak at Rachel's iPhone. \nSETH (CONT'D) (IMPRESSED) Whoa! Nice! Now that I would put on the wall. (off Adam's look) I can see you're in the middle of something. I'll just be in the other room. \nSeth crosses to the living room. Rachel picks up the conversation where they left off. \nRACHEL It's a portrait series, commenting on post-colonial patriarchy in the Congo. (off Adam's look) ...That's it. Nothing more. \nADAM Have you lost your mind? I had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your \"art partner\"...And what the fuck do you know about Africa? \nRachel totally forgot about his appointment. The guilt runs through her body. \nRACHEL Oh shit. I forgot. Please, Adam, I'm so sorry. (CONCERNED) What did the doctor say? \nADAM Did you cheat on me? \nRACHEL (CRYING) Adam stop. Tell me what the doctor said. \nADAM DID-YOU-CHEAT-ON-ME!? \nLike a child being scolded, Rachel's face says it all. \nRACHEL (POUTING) Are you going to break up with me? \nADAM No. (BEAT) I'm going to pretend you never existed. \nRACHEL (CRYING HYSTERICALLY) Please. I don't want to break up. \nADAM You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment. \nRACHEL I told you I couldn't handle this! \nRachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes. She takes his hand. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry...I love you. \nThey embrace. A beat. Adam lets go. He looks Rachel in the eyes. \nADAM I want you out my house. \nAdam walks out the back door. \nSeth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face. He stares her down. \nSETH Shame on you. \nSeth exits out the back door. \nEXT. YACHT CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAdam and Seth sit on the bow of a docked sail boat. The two have had a lot to drink. Adam is understandably upset. \nSETH Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted? \nADAM (DISGUSTED) I know. \nSETH (BEAT) Is \"dreams\" a metaphor, for- \nSeth makes a masturbating motion with his hand. \nADAM You remember the last time we came out here? \nSETH Prom night. How could I forget? Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting. \nADAM That memory is so far from me, \n", "test3_id": 1811}

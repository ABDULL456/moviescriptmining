{"test1_input": "Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head. \nADAM (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Sorry. \nAdam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself. \nAdam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck. \nRACHEL Mmmmm. \nRachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair. Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair. She holds it up. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Oh my god. \nADAM What? \nRACHEL I think you have a gray hair. \nADAM Really? \nRACHEL I'm gonna pull it out. \nADAM No! Don't touch it. \nAdam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel rolls back to sleep. \nINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAdam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It is in fact a gray hair. He smiles. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair. He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product. \nINT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER \nSETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: \"Let's put the Christ back in Christmas.\" \nOverweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. \nJust then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment. \nSETH Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it? \nThe mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. \nAdam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave to Adam. \nANDREW Hey Adam. \nADAM (SEEMS ANNOYED) Hey Andrew. \nANDREW Sorry about the noise last night. \nAdam shrugs as if to say \"what the fuck?\" Andrew and Missy giggle as they get into their car. \nINT. SETH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nAdam gets into the car. \nSETH Yo. \nADAM Yo. \nSETH ...What's that smell? (SNIFFS ADAM) Are you wearing perfume? \nADAM No. \nSETH Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias. \nADAM (SMELLS HIMSELF) I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachel's. \nSETH For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis. \nAdam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on. \nADAM Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air. \nSeth ignores Adam and turns up the music. \nADAM (CONT'D) (ANNOYED) Seriously, my allergies are flaring up. It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire. \n", "test1_true": "SETH Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER \nWe see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other. \nSETH I don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...He's wearing Capris! \nADAM Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat... (THINKS) I guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down. (BEAT) Sex every three weeks is normal? Right? \nSETH (IN SHOCK) You haven't had sex in three weeks? \nADAM (SHRUGS) You think maybe she's mad cause I haven't asked her to move in? \nSETH What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons. \nSeth laughs at his own joke. \nSETH (CONT'D) But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you? \nADAM It's not that big a deal. \nSETH So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off...4 days. That's when I begin to worry. \nADAM Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel? \nSETH Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million. \nADAM But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull. \nSETH My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population. \nAdam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much. \nBARISTA Morning gentlemen. \nSETH (TO BARISTA) Would you sleep with my friend. \nBARISTA Like, right now? \nSETH No just in general. \nBARISTA Yeah, I'd fuck him. \nThe Barista yells to DEMETRI, the other Barista. \nBARISTA (CONT'D) Hey Demetri, (RE: ADAM) Fuckable? \nDemetri examines Adam. He's not impressed with what he sees. \nDEMETRI I'd let you blow me. \nSETH (TO ADAM) See this is what I'm saying. \nThe Barista hands Seth and Adam two cups of coffee, they each leave a dollar. \nINT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - LATER \nAdam and Seth enter the museum. They pass JENNY (30) at the information desk. \nSETH AND ADAM Good morning Jenny. \nJenny ignores them. \nSETH (UNDER BREATH) I love you. \nPHIL (60), the museum's vivacious director approaches. \nPHIL Salutations gentlemen. \nPhil sniffs the air and looks at Adam. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Are you wearing perfume? \nADAM It's Rachel's shampoo. \nPhil goes in for a closer sniff. Then an even closer sniff. Adam looks uncomfortable. \nPHIL (DECLARATIVE) Fructis by L'oreal. (IMPRESSED) My wife uses that. (TO SETH) What are you wearing? \nSeth's eyes open wide as Phil goes in for a sniff. \nPHIL (CONT'D) What is that? \nSETH Ah, mothballs? \n", "test1_id": 1809, "test2_input": "Seth spots a GROUP OF SECOND GRADERS with their TEACHER assembled by the entrance. \nSETH (CONT'D) Looks like my group is here. \nSeth slaps on a button that reads \"DOCENT\" and rushes off to greet the students. \nSETH (CONT'D) See you guys later. \nPhil turns to Adam. \nPHIL How's the Origins exhibit coming along? \nADAM We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic. \nPHIL I'm counting on you not to screw up. (looks into Adam's eyes) You're the only one I can trust. (BEAT) (MORE) \nPHIL (CONT'D) The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors...We're a dying art Adam. \nPhil stares into Adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity. It's incredibly awkward. \nADAM Phil? \nPHIL Yeah? \nADAM I should probably get to work. \nPHIL That's probably a good idea. \nPhil looks at the clock - 10 a.m. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I think I'm gonna go to lunch. \nPhil wanders off. \nINT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - LATER \nAdam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices. \nADAM Greg. What are you doing? \nGREG It's a velociraptor. \nADAM Where did it come from? \nGREG The dinosaur exhibit. (off Adam's look) Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...People love dinosaurs. \nAdam cringes in frustration. \nADAM Greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it. \nGreg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam. \nSeth leads his tour of second graders. He speaks like a tour guide at Universal Studios. \nSETH Coming up here on our left is the \"Origins of Man\" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it. (SPOTS ADAM) Adam! \nAdam looks up. He hates this part of his job. \nSETH (CONT'D) Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum. \nAdam gives a reluctant wave. \nADAM Hey kids. \nSETH (TO ADAM) Why don't you tell us what we're looking at. \nADAM (BEGRUDGINGLY) This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago... \nIn excitement, the kids move in for a closer look. Unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails. \nADAM (CONT'D) ...these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans... \nKID 1 touches the Cro Magnon father. Still talking, Adam steps in and moves Kid 1's hand off. \nADAM (CONT'D) ...What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick. \nKID 1 (TO SETH) This is lame! I thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs. \nGREG (TO ADAM) See, I told you. \nDamage control. Seth points to a life sized NEANDERTHAL MAN holding a spear. \nSETH (IN EXCITEMENT) Who wants to hear about the caveman? \nSeth picks up the spear and pretends to charge Adam. \n", "test2_true": "The kids cheer. \nAnnoyed, Adam takes the spear out of Seth's hand. \nADAM This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe. But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone. \nGREG What happened? \nADAM Greg you know what happened. \nGREG I do? \nSETH Come on! Tell us what happened to the caveman. \nADAM Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again. \nSETH (game show voice) That's quite a story. Thank you Adam. \nSeth and Adam look at the kids, they look bored. \nSETH (CONT'D) (Quietly to Adam) You really know how to win a crowd. \nADAM (to the kids) But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now. And by the looks of this guy HERE - (points at Neanderthal) I'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders. \nAdam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero response from the kids. \nKID 1 This sucks ass. \nAdam and Seth look at each other in shock...Seth chimes in - \nSETH I see dinosaurs. \nSeth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. The kids follow in excitement. The teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group. \nEXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - LATER \nAdam enters the hospital... \nINT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM - LATER \nAdam leafs through a pamphlet on Incontinence. \nThe pedantic DR. ROSS enters and completely ignores Adam. Instead, he looks over Adam's chart, examines his MRI scans, and pulls out a DICTAPHONE - \nDR. ROSS (into the dictaphone) Patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats. Blood tests and urine analysis are normal. MRI indicates a massive intraduaral extradural MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion. \nWe see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) Growth extends from the L2 to L5. Cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended. \nDr. Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) Yes. Questions? \nADAM (DUMBFOUNDED) I have no idea what you just said. Is there something wrong with me? \nDR. ROSS (points to MRI) If you look here on your MRI, you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column? \nAdam squints. It all looks the same. \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) That is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas. \nADAM I still have no idea what you're talking about. \nDR. ROSS It's a malignant tumor. \nADAM What?!...A tumor? No. \nDR. ROSS I'm afraid so. \nADAM How is that possible?...I don't smoke. I don't drink. I eat healthy...I even recycle. \nDR. ROSS Well Adam it's actually quite fascinating. Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. In your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine. \nAdam looks at himself in the mirror. \nADAM (still in denial) But, look at me. I don't look sick. \nDR. ROSS Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. We're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes. (MORE) \nDR. ROSS (CONT'D) (BEAT) I'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. It's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work. \nThis is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature figurines. \nAdam turns back to Dr. Ross. \n", "test2_id": 1810, "test3_input": "ADAM What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee? \nSeth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN behind him. \nSETH (quietly to Adam) Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - \"I have these things and I want the world to see them.\" \nGreg looks up at the menu of endless options. \nGREG What about that frozen drink, what's that like? \nBARISTA (ENTHUSIASTIC) The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute heaven. \nGREG I don't know. Does it have a lot of sugar? \nADAM We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car? \nSeth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts. \nSETH Why are you in such a rush? \nAdam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations. \nADAM Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place? \nGreg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps. \nADAM (CONT'D) I don't believe it. Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning. \nSETH Relax. We have plenty of time. \nADAM No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite. \nSETH What the fuck is wrong with you? \nADAM (QUIETLY) I have cancer. \nSETH (LAUGHS) Yeah right. \nADAM I'm serious. \nSETH Get the fuck out of here. You have cancer? \nPeople in line look at Seth. \nADAM Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement. \nSETH (QUIETLY) When did this happen? \nADAM Yesterday. They found a tumor in my spine. \nSETH Who? \nADAM What do you mean who? \nSETH Who found the tumor? \nADAM Lewis and Clark...The doctors found it. \nSETH When were you going to tell me? \nADAM I'm telling you now. \nSETH If I had cancer I'd tell you right away. \nADAM What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up. \nSETH Holy shit! \nSeth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his face...he quickly shakes it off. \nSETH (CONT'D) Okay, let's relax here. (BEAT) I think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side. \nADAM The bright side of what? \nSETH (EMPHATICALLY) This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. This is it. This is your time to live it up. (A BEAT) Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get? \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nRachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nAdam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. In Adam's hand is the business card with \"Mount Sinai Psychology Group\" written on it. He finds the office and knocks on the half opened door. \nThe office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about. \n", "test3_true": "Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich. \nKATIE (mouth full of food) Can I help you? \nADAM I have an appointment with Dr. McRae. \nKatie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake Adam's. \nKATIE Please call me Katie. \nADAM (CONFUSED) You're Dr. McRae? \nKATIE You were expecting someone else? \nKatie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away. \nADAM Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters? \nKATIE (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE) Why? Did someone say that's what I look like? \nADAM No, no, no. I was just expecting someone older. \nKATIE Sorry to disappoint you. \nADAM No believe me, you're fine. Better than fine, you're Dr. McRae...you're a doctor? How old are you? \nKATIE Twenty-six. \nADAM Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser? \nKATIE Who? \nADAM Doogie Howser... \nOff Katie's blank look. \nADAM (CONT'D) ...The teenage doctor. \nKATIE Does he work here? \nADAM No. Nevermind...but aren't you young to be a doctor? \nKATIE I'm actually in my final semester of medical school. (off Adam's look) This is a training hospital. \nADAM So have you had many patients? \nKATIE You're actually my first. \nThat did not help to ease Adam's anxiety. \nADAM Oh. \nKATIE Please sit. \nAdam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from it as possible. \nKatie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy. \nKATIE (CONT'D) Dr. Ross filled me in on your situation. Tell me, how have you been feeling? \nADAM Honestly. I feel fine. \nKATIE I think that's great considering what you're going through. \nADAM Yeah, but I tend to internalize everything so, who knows. \nKATIE You mean you repress as a coping mechanism. \nADAM Is that what I do? \nKATIE That's what you just said. \nADAM The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. When you say it, it's like an indictment. The word \"repress\" - sounds so harsh. \nKATIE It's actually quite common. \nADAM Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm anything but an emotional sheep. \nKATIE Don't think of it in those terms. It's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments. \nADAM So how do we do that? \nKATIE The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. This is your chance to correct that. \nADAM You're not in a cult are you? \n", "test3_id": 1811}

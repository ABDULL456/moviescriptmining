The two turn the corner, stepping into - 
INT.  CLERICAL AREA - ARCHIVES - DAY 
BIANCA BERNADETTE, an aging, former actress in her late forties, early fifties, sits behind a desk doing paperwork. 
Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at Gale and Jennifer. 
BIANCA Can I help you? 
GALE I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me? 
Bianca shakes her head "no". 
BIANCA I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need? 
GALE Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you? 
BIANCA Nope. 
GALE (groans) Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you. 
Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused. 
BIANCA Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now? 
GALE Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president? 
Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, slides the money back. 
BIANCA The president . . . of the studio. 
JENNIFER Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew? 
Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the desk. It's absolutely stunning. 
JENNIFER Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy. (to Gale) My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story. 
How can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger. 
BIANCA Follow me. 
Gale reaches for her Twenty. Bianca slaps her hand, takes it, folding it up, sliding it between her cleavage. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FILE ROOM - ARCHIVES - DAY 
BIANCA (staring at picture, flipping through file cabinet) I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott -- 
GALE (interrupting) It may be Maureen Reynolds -- 
BIANCA Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will. 
JENNIFER (smiling) Rina Reynolds. What a stage name. 
BIANCA You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.

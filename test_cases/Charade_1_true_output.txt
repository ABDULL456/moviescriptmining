REGGIE Please keep it. 
FÉLIX I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these. 
He hands her the four stamps and her change. 
REGGIE I'm -- I'm sorry. 
CLOSE SHOT -- FÉLIX 
FÉLIX No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to ADAM's room and knocks. 
REGGIE Adam? Adam? It's me, Reggie -- ! 
There is no answer. She goes to her own door and, to her surprise, finds it an inch or two ajar. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE enters. She freezes, having seen something on the floor. 
MED. SHOT -- TEX 
His dead body lies on the floor, the wrists of his extended arms tied to the leg of the bed, his ankles to the steam radiator. And tied around his head is a plastic, transparent bag, inside of which the suffocated man's face, the eyes bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features, can be seen all too clearly. REGGIE enters the shot, bending down to see if he's alive. Then she sees something beside his hands near the leg of the bed. 
CLOSE SHOT -- CARPET 
With his dying effort, TEX has traced a name against the grain of the maroon carpet -- 'DYLE.' 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE 
Astonished and horrified. 
REGGIE (gasping) Dyle -- 
WIDER ANGLE 
As she gets to her feet and hurries to the phone. 
REGGIE (on the phone) Hello -- Balzac 30-04, s'il vous plait -- (waiting) Mr. Bartholomew! Thank God you're there! Tex is dead, Mr. Bartholomew -- smothered -- and Adam did it -- he killed them all! 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
BARTHOLOMEW, his face lathered for a shaving, is on the phone. 
BARTHOLOMEW Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam? 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE (on the phone) The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something! 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
BARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money? 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE (on the phone) No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope. 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
BARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert. 
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
REGGIE (on the phone) Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye. 
She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then hurries to the door. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator. She presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to the stairs and starts down. 
INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE -- NIGHT 
Between the landings. The stairs curve around the open elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet. 
ADAM Reggie -- the stamps -- what've you done with --? 
REGGIE starts running downstairs. 
ADAM Where are you going? Wait! 
ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the cage down. 
ADAM Reggie! 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- SECOND LANDING -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind her. 
ADAM Reggie! 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- FIRST LANDING -- NIGHT 
As REGGIE continues to run. 
INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY -- NIGHT 
Between the first landing and the lobby. REGGIE running, the elevator following. 
ADAM Reggie -- stop! 
REGGIE Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it! 
ADAM I'm not Dyle -- you know that! 
REGGIE But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- 
ADAM Don't be an idiot! 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT 
REGGIE reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races toward the front door and out. The confused hotel MANAGER behind the desk can only stare in surprise. The elevator, ADAM inside, has not yet reached the bottom. 
ADAM Reggie -- ! I want those stamps!

STUART (noticing Charlie) Come give your old man a kiss or I'll kick your teeth in. 
The group are eating dinner on TV trays. Charlie walks over and turns off the record. 
MAY Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride. (begins singing; in thick Scottish accent) HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD... 
STUART May, shut it. 
STUART MACKENZIE is in his late fifties, a butcher, with Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair. His red- haired wife, MAY, is in her fifties, attractive with a soft, but tough appearance. Little WILLIAM, has a very large head and a skinny neck. Like Charlie, he was born in America. 
Charlie gives his Mom a hug, his father a kiss. 
CHARLIE Hey, William. 
WILLIAM (on his stomach on the floor; watching TV) Hey, Charlie. 
STUART SCORES! MAGIC GOAL! 
On the television, Stuart's team, Glasgow Celtic, has scored. 
TONY Aye -- magic. 
STUART Let's have a look at the re-play. William, move your head. Look at the size of that ooy's heed. I'm not kidding. It's like an orange on a tooth pick. 
MAY Stuart, you're going to give the boy a complex. 
STUART I'm not kidding. That's a huge noggin'. It has it's own weather system. It's a virtual planetoid. (shouting to William) Heed! Move! 
We see the re-play of the goal on TV. Tony sits down and May brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes, piled very high. 
MAY Is that enough potatoes, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in "Close Encounters". 
STUART (sniffs the air) Do I smell haggis? 
CHARLIE Aye, you do. 
MAY (taking it) I'll put it in the frig. 
Charlie notices Tony reading some papers. He realizes it's literature from the Lyndon H. LaRouche Society. 
CHARLIE Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? Why do you abuse his mind like this? 
STUART That's the latest report from Lyndon H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen and the Rothschilds masterminded the Soviet overthrow, so that they could reclaim lands they had annexed during the Holy Roman Empire. 
TONY (goading Charlie) You know a lot of this makes sense. 
CHARLIE I think you're suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors. 
STUART Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact there's a society of the five wealthiest people in the world, called the Pentaverate, who run everything and meet three times a year at a secret country mansion in Colorado, known as "The Meadows." 
CHARLIE (sarcastic) And that's obviously why we haven't heard about it in the newspapers. 
STUART (inappropriately angry & loud) That's right. They fuckin' own the papers, smartass. And everything else. Why do you think Scotland's not been able to get independence? Because the Queen the Pentavirate and those English dome heads in West Minster won't have it. 
CHARLIE Who are the other members of this pentaverate? 
STUART The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders before he went tits up. Oh, I hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes. And that smug look on his face. 
CHARLIE Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?" 
STUART Because the Colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly. 
CHARLIE Interesting... coo-coo 
MAY Would anyone like a juice? Charlie, did I tell you, we bought a Juice Tiger? 
CHARLIE A Juice Tiger? 
MAY Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet. Would you like potato juice?

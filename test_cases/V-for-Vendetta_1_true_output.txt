V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the Shadow Gallery. 
EXT.  EMPTY STREET 
A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the cobblestones glistening like black scales. 
The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows, avoiding the pools of streetlight.  It is Evey, a frightened look on her face. 
INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER 
A woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on stage in this smoky burlesque bar.  It is a popular place with locals and Fingermen. 
Peter Creedy squeezes through the crowd, angling for the back of the bar where a number of loud Fingermen are drinking. 
CREEDY What's all this, then, Harper?  I get a radio that a man's down and in need of assistance? 
HARPER I ain't gone down yet but I sure do need some assistance. 
Creedy leans in. 
CREEDY Are you flat broke already? 
They break up in laughter, led by Creedy who sits next to Harper, pouring himself a drink. 
LOUT How'd you sneak away, Creedy? Almond off buggering that blonde chippy? 
HARPER The one with the tits? 
They all begin to hoot and whistle. 
CREEDY What I wouldn't give for a piece of that. 
LOUT She could serve a tray of drinks on those thingies. 
HARPER I bet you get your chance with her sooner than later, Creedy, with the way Almond's crackin' up. 
LOUT Bloody bugger's losing his marbles. 
HARPER Terrorist or no, if that bastard gives me another double shift, I'll stomp his fucking head. 
Creedy raises his drink. 
CREEDY Aye.  This nonsense has put a serious strain on my drinking.  I think I was actually sober today. 
LOUT I'll drink to that. 
HARPER We need to get a real man of the people in that director's position. Like Creedy here. 
Everyone cheers in agreement. 
CREEDY Well, it's good to know when the shit hits the fan who your real friends are. 
They salute and drink. 
INT.  ALMOND HOME 
Derek Almond sits hunched under a desk lamp, pumping the cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush. 
Rosemary shuffles up to him, her frumpy gown gathered around her. 
ROSEMARY Derek -- 
He blows down one of the cylinders, not looking up. 
DEREK I don't want to hear it, Rosemary. 
ROSEMARY Derek, please!  We can't carry on like this. 
Derek stares at the gun, rage building. 
ROSEMARY You don't talk to me.  You don't eat with me.  You don't have sex -- 
Derek leaps up, slugging her. 
Rosemary clatters to the ground in tears.  Derek glowering over her. 
DEREK I don't have to take any crap from you!  I have that fat bastard riding me all day.  I don't want to listen to you, so shut your fat gob! 
He leans into her face. 
DEREK And me not wanting to fuck you is obvious.  Take a look at yourself. 
He sits back in front of the gun, wiping it down. 
DEREK Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning my gun. 
INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME 
Dr. Surridge sits somberly in the dark, street light filtering in from the open curtains. 
Her eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it over in her hands, fingers tracing the soft petals. 
After a moment, she stands, letting it fall from her lap. 
INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE 
Finch turns as Dominic bursts in. 
DOMINIC I got it! 
FINCH A connection? 
Dominic waves a printout. 
DOMINIC Larkhill Resettlement Camp. Prothero's and Lilliman's employment records show they both help positions there at similar times. 
FINCH What about codename V? 
DOMINIC Most of Larkhill's records were destroyed for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual. 
Dominic smiles.

WALTER Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch. 
ROSEN (stung) Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch? 
WALTER Forget it. 
ROSEN Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name. 
WALTER Rosen? I don't have a problem with that. 
ROSEN Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung. 
WALTER I don't need someone else. 
osen settles back. 
ROSEN Fine.

INT./EXT. APARTMENT - DAY 
Continued from previous journal scene. Walter sits at his windowsill writing in his journal. There is the sound of children arriving to school outside. He looks up. 
WALTER But for the last few weeks I've noticed someone else watching them. 
Walter's POV: The man with the white Volvo stands leaning against his car watching a bus load of children arrive. He pops M&Ms in his mouth. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (CONT'D) (CONT'D) I call him Candy. 
The boys run and tackle each other. A group walks by Candy. 
WALTER (V.0.)(cont'd) He talks to the boys, fifth and sixth graders. He goes for the pretty ones, faces like angels. 
Walter finishes writing then looks outside. 
INT. BUS - MORNING 
Walter stands on a crowded bus, staring out the window at the landscape rushing by. The bus pulls to a stop. Passengers get off, then a group of girls come crashing onto the bus. They overflow with energy and giggles. 
Walter squeezes back so they can get by, but the bus lurches into motion throwing one of the girls into Walter. He helps her regain her balance, and the girl smiles at him. G 
IRL Sorry! 
She and her friends burst into laughter and move on past. 
Walter watches her move down the aisle then quickly turns away, scanning the faces surrounding him. No one looks at him.

Walter sweats heavily as he works. Vicki walks by and glances at Walter as she passes. He doesn't notice her. 
INT. WAREHOUSE CAFETERIA - DAY 
Walter sits at a table eating. Vicki sits down across from him. They eat silently. Walter doesn't look up. Vicki blows a straw wrapper, hitting Walter in the face.

ary-Kay sits across the room watching the flirtation between Vicki and Walter. 
INT. WAREHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY 
Vicki exits a stall and goes to the sink to wash her hands. She's smiling a little smile to herself. 
Mary-Kay enters and starts primping in the mirror, fixing her hair, putting on lipstick. She watches Vicki in the reflection of the mirror. 
MARY-KAY I'd keep away from him. 
VICKI What? 
MARY-KAY The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you. 
VICKI Why's that? 
MARY-KAY You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VICKI (cold) Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice. 
Mary-Kay smiles, missing Vicki's ironic tone. 
MARY-KAY Just trying to be helpful. 
VICKI Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you? 
Mary-Kay's smile withers into a sneer.

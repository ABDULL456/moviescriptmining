Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the junk.  Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping.  She tries to push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls. 
Jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to help her up. 
JACOB You okay? 
Gina SCREAMS. 
GINA No!  Yes!  Let go of me! 
She shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused Jacob. 
KAREN She doesn't like to be touched. 
JACOB No shit! 
KAREN Don't take it personally.  It's not her fault. 
JACOB What happened to her? 
KAREN Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina to carry on the tradition.  When she was thirteen... 
JACOB Jesus. 
Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern.  Karen gives him the same expression. 
KAREN You look terrible. 
JACOB (smiling) Thanks. 
KAREN I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all. 
JACOB I can't talk about it right now.  I'll tell you later.  I promise. 
KAREN Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You look like you could use it. 
JACOB I think I will. 
He gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes it.  Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it. 
ON SCOTT 
He's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, and he DOESN'T like it. 
WITH JACOB 
as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall.  He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building. 
JACOB'S POV - THE BRICK WALL 
sits there quietly for a few beats until: 
IT EXPLODES 
Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through: 
DREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD 
Horrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us.  Gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky.  MUTANTS and twisted MONSTERS.  Shadowy streets and dark alleyways.  And FIVE RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a VOICE rings out. 
VOICE Hey, you! 
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB 
Jacob's eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him. 
SUPERVISOR No slacking off.  Back to work. 
The boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a babbling crazy man. 
JACOB What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit! 
SUPERVISOR Whoa!  Get a grip, boy. 
The supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to reality again. 
JACOB Huh?  What's going on? 
SUPERVISOR Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see if you can change it, okay? 
Jacob calms down and nods.  He walks away, snatching a nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall.

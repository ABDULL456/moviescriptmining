ROBERT All ready. 
(CONTINUED)

19 INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY 
The Chinese CHEF in the busy, steamy kitchen is inspecting the shark fins Jason has brought him. Jason is anxious to finish business and go. 
CHEF You no like my company? Fine. Who cares. Bring me more fin, you retire. You no want to retire? Good. Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things. 
JASON You ever caught a shark? 
CHEF 
(BIGGER) You ever cook one? 
JASON Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm. 
JASON He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint. 
CHEF -- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of 
TEETH) Nice fin, Jason. He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS. 
20 EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
Jason jams on his helmet and starts his. motorcycle, guns it down the street.

21 EXT. WINE SHOP - DAY 
Robert and Alex are loading cases of wine into the trunk of the Caddy when Jason skids into the parking lot. He takes off his helmet. 
ALEX Just get in the car. 
22 INT. CADILLAC - DAY (TRAVELING) 
Jason has fallen asleep while Alex drives. Alex picks up Jason's hand. Jerking awake, Jason tries to pull away, but his reflexes are sleep-slowed. Alex sniffs Jason's fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back. 
ALEX You stink. 
JASON I washed. 
ALEX There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands. 
ALEX ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively. 
(CONTINUED) 
22 CONTINUED: 
ALEX Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other.

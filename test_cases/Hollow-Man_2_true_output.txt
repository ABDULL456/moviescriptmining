SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) ... where my body is. 
A moment of silence. 
LINDA Sebastian? 
No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly alarmed. 
MATT Sebastian? 
An indentation forms on the bed a moment later. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You really can't see me. Can you? 
LINDA Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No, just tired. (beat) It's funny. I can see everything... more than before... but I can't see myself. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter. 
CARTER Hey. How's he doing? 
LINDA Why don't you ask him? 
Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four of them stare at the nothing. 
SARAH Sebastian, how do you feel. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Not to bad, considering. 
They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them. The group rises from their various workstations and turn toward where the voice came from. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Odd, isn't it? 
A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim. Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous. 
LINDA He can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light. 
Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease. 
JANICE So, what was it like? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Over here. 
Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again, he can't stifle a slight giggle. 
LINDA C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Sorry. Couldn't resist. 
His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room. 
FRANK I feel like we're playing Marco Polo. 
MATT Well, I see the procedure hasn't changed your personality. 
Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES. 
FRANK No worries. I'm on it. 
THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points. 
FRANK (cont'd) Gotcha, big man. 
THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Boy, you people have no sense of humor. 
A chair slides back from a desk and bends under Sebastian's weight. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Show me. So ... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase shift. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Stop there. 
Frank halts the tape.

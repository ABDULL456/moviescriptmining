Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him] \nGuard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal! \n[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons one by one] \nGuard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here. \nShan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect. \n[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. He bows, then looks up] \nGeneral Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border. \nChi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor motions for Chi Fu's silence] \nGeneral Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately. \nEmperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, \nChi Fu:  Yes, your highness. \nEmperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up reserves and as many new recruits as possible. \nGeneral Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him. \nEmperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat. \n[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the mound of rice] \nMulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual. [A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit- ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart boy, can you help me with my chores today? \nBath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building] \nFa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck. \nGrandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be, they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street] \nFa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No! \n[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee] \nGrandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright] \nFa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai. \n[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay stuck in her hair] \nMulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had to-- \nFa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the preparation area] \n[Song: Honor to us all] \nBath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath] \nMulan [spoken]:  It's freezing. \nFa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time. \nBath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]: We'll have you Washed and dried Primped and polished till you glow with pride Trust my recipe for instant bride You'll bring honor to us all \nFa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this? \nMulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes, in case I forget something? \nGrandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment] \nGrandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her sash] [sings] \nBeads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck] You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand] Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased] And even you can't blow it \nMulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens] Ancestors Hear my plea Help me not to make a fool of me And to not uproot my fam'ly tree Keep my father standing tall \nMaidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall in line with the other 4 maidens] Scarier than the undertaker We are meeting our matchmaker \nAll Townspeople: Destiny Guard our girls And our future as it fast unfurls Please look kindly on these cultured pearls Each a perfect porcelain doll \nMaiden #1:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all! \n[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their parasols.  End of song] \nMatchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan \nMulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present. \nMatchmaker:  Speaking without permission. \nMulan:  Oops. \nGrandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd? \n[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following behind and closing the door] \nMatchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. [Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her] Recite the final admonition. \nMulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu \nMatchmaker:  Well... \nMulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised, Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh. \nMatchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup] \n[Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to life] \nFirst Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]:  Mushu, awaken! \n[Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being obscured by smoke] \nMushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]:  I live!  So tell me what mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm there. \nFirst Ancestor [agitated]:  Mushu! \nMushu:  Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr. \nFirst Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]:  Mushu!  These are the family guardians [motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling]. They... \nMushu [dejectedly]:  Protect the family. \nFirst Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]:  And you, oh demoted one. \nMushu:  I...ring the gong. \nFirst Ancestor:  That's right, now, wake up the ancestors. \nMushu:  One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people, people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me! \nAncestor 1:  I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the start. \nAncestor 3:  Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family. \nAncestor 2:  She's just trying to help her father. \nAncestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]:  But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values will disintegrate. \nAncestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm. \nAncestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became acupuncturists. \nMushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya. \nMushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me! \nFirst Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon, have you awaken? \nMushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon? \nFirst Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws. \nMushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him] \nMushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. [Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road. \n[Cri-Kee enters stage right] \nCri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. \nMushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right] \nCri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp. \nMushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming? \nCri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. \nMushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you? \nCri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp. \nMushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you? \n[Interlude] \n[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts before the rest of the army] \n[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po] \nLing:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes. \n[Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew] \nMulan:  Hey guys. \n[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent.  General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.] \nGeneral Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]:  The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village. \nChi Fu:  Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha. \nGeneral Li:  You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands a sword to Shang] \nShang:  Captain? \nChi Fu:  Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience-- \nGeneral Li:  Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job. \nShang [excitedly]:  Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir. \nGeneral Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]:  Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.  [to Chi Fu] I'll expect a full report in three weeks. \nChi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent] \nShang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse] \nChi Fu:  Most impressive. \nGeneral Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp] \nShang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs] \nShang:  Mushu? \nMulan:  No. \nShang:  Then what is it! \nMushu:  Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up! \nMulan:  It's Ping. \nShang:  Ping. \nMushu:  Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together] \nMulan:  Yes, my name is Ping. \nShang:  Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou? \nChi Fu:  I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son. \nMulan:  Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The recruits laugh] \nChi Fu:  I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic. \nShang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And tomorrow, the real work begins. \n[All recruits growl at Mulan] \nMushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills. \n[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock] \nMushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup, hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge] \nMulan:  Am I late? \n[End Interlude] \n[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee] \nMushu:  Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you? \nMulan [from behind the reeds]:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one. \nMushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]:  So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I kinda like that corn chip's smell. \nMulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]:  Ahhhhhhh. \nMushu:   Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes covered]. \nMulan:   Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch. \nMushu:  Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene. \nCri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]:  Chirp, Chirp. \nYao:  Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers] \nMushu [gasps]:  Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice! \n[Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad] \nYao [calling]:  Hey, Ping. \n[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest] \nMulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]:  Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share \"this boy is strange\" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front facing the rock] \nLing [from behind Mulan]:  Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling! \nMulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]:  Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po] \nMulan:  I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake] \nMushu:  Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts. \n[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully.  Chi Fu and Shang are talking from inside] \nChi Fu [fading in]:  You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns. \nShang:  They completed their training. \nChi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle. \nMushu [from outside the tent]:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my plan. \nShang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]:  We're not finished. \nChi Fu [pulling the board away]:  Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the way, huh, I got that job on my own.  [opens the entrance to the tent for Shang] You're dismissed. \n[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan] \nMulan [in a manly voice]:  Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...  [Shang walks by without reacting] or not.  [calling out to Shang] For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward] \nMushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]:  I saw that! \nMulan [innocently]:  What? \nMushu [teasing]:  You like him don't you? \nMulan:  No, I-- \nMushu:  Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together]. \n[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He finishes and Mushu takes the paper] \nMushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, \"and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing up some.\"  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go. \nYao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]: My girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars \nChien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]: I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like It all depends on what she cooks like: Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed] \nAll Three: Mmm... \nYao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads.  Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]: Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer \nLing [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]: And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self] \nArmy Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage holding cannons.  Cri-Kee looks shocked.  The ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]: You can guess what we have missed the most since we went off to war What do we want? A girl worth fighting for! \nYao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]: My girl will think I have no faults \nChien-Po: That I'm a major find \nMulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal woman.  She is forced to speak (sing)]: [spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's got a brain,  [Yao starts to look unimpressed] Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders] \nLing, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah! \nLing [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly.  Ling leans against the carriage of cannons]: My manly ways and turns of phrase are sure to thrill her \nYao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling.  Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]: He thinks he's such a lady-killer! \nChi Fu: I've a girl back home who's unlike any other. \nYao [aside to Mulan]: Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles] \nArmy Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]: But when we come home in victory they'll line up at the door! \nLing [sitting on top of Chien-Po]: What do we want? \nArmy Chorus: A girl worth fighting for! \nLing: Wish that I had \nShang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the arrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!! \n[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire] \nShang:  Save the cannons! \n[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan. \nMushu:  Oh sure, save the horse. \n[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them] \nShang:  Fire! \n[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides] \nShang:  Fire! \n[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming from the mountain position] \nShang:  Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare to fight.  If we die, we die with honor. \n[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows] \nShang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu. \n[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward] \nYao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey. \nShang:  Ping, come back.  Ping! \n[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the oncoming horde with worry in his eyes] \nShang [starting to run after her waving his arms]:  Stop! \n[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling] \nChien-Po:  Do you see them? \nYao [extatically]:  Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his hands]--ty. \n[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield] \nMushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky cricket. \nMulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan] \nMushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can survive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao] \nYao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff] \nYao:  Pull \n[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety] \nMushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces] \n[The soldiers help them up to the cliff] \nLing:  Step back guys, give 'em some air. \nShang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust. [Mulan smiles big] \nLing:  Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all. \nYao [lifting his arm high]:  You're king of the mountain! \nChien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes! \nMulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side] \nYao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo! \nChi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law. \n[Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan] \nShang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out! \nChi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just... \nShang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, \"Move out!\" \n[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick] \nMushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi. \nMulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home. \nMushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry]. \nMulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek] \nMushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean, you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles]. \nCri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl. \nMushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep? \nMulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home. \nMushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise. \n[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around] \nShan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh! \n[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward] \nMulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya. \n[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard] \nMushu:  Now where are you going? \nMulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard] \n[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent] \nEmperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors. \n[The crowd cheers] \n[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd] \nMulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen! \nMushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something? \nMulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu! \nMushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember? \n[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor] \nShang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu. \nEmperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. \n[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts] \nShang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No. \nLing [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]:  Oh he's so cute. \n[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure] \nShang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]:  Aww. \n[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk.  Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing] \nMushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]:  Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned falcon doesn't do anything] \n[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back] \nMulan [calling out]:  Shang, GO! \n[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs] \n[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony] \nShan-Yu:  I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's throat] Bow to me! \nEmperor:  No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it. \nShan-Yu:  Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor] \n[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the stairs] \nMulan:  Chien-Po, get the Emperor. \nChien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]:  Sorry, your Majesty. \n[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu watches the Emperor leave] \nShan-Yu:  No! \n[Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight] \nMushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You're worst nightmare. \n[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground] \n[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest] \nMan in Crowd #1:  On the roof. \nMan in Crowd #2:  Look! \n[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it] \nShan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas. \n[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off the fan with her sword movement] \nMulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu? \nMushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights the fuse] \n[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword] \nMulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof. \n[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by] \nMushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna] \nChi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting. \nShang [in Chi Fu's face]:  She's a hero. \nChi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything. \nShang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous-- \nMulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan] \nShang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm. \n[Mulan mounts Khan] \nMulan:  Khan, let's go home. \n[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat] \nEmperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all. \nShang [dumbfounded]:  Sir? \nEmperor:  You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace] \n[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her approaching and starts to stand] \nFa Zhou:  Mulan. \n[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down] \nMulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa Family. \n[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched] \nFa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so. \nMulan:  I've missed you too Baba. \n[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway] \nFa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh \nGrandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang] \n", "test1_input": "[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof] \nChi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the Huns have invaded China! \nTownspeople [expressing surprise]:  No! \nChi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family. \nYi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my father's place. \nChi Fu:  The Fa Family. \nMulan:  No. \n[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before the horsemen] \nFa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches for the conscription notice] \nMulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription notice]:  Father, you can't go. \nFa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan! \nMulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely-- \nChi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man's presence. \nFa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me. \n[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away] \nChi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu Shu camp. \nFa Zhou:  Yes, sir.

The... \n", "test1_true": "[Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table and stands up] \nMulan:  You shouldn't have to go. \nFa Li:  Mulan! \nMulan:  There are plenty of young men to fight for China. \nFa Zhou:  It is an honor to protect my country and my family. \nMulan [angrily]:  So you'll die for honor! \nFa Zhou [standing up and angered]:  I will DIE doing what's right. \nMulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you-- \nFa Zhou:  I know my place, it is time you learned yours. \n[Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs outside into the rain storm and cries] \n[Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the gate and off to camp.] \n[Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.

It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside] [calling out]  Mulan! [He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury] No. \nFa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]:  You must go after her.

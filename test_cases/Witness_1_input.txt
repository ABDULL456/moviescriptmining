RACHEL No, he must stay here. 
Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And: 
ELI Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws  
RACHEL We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! 
ELI Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands. 
RACHEL I know God help me, I know that, Eli. (then) But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. 
Rachel beseeches them helplessly: 
RACHEL What else can we do? 
EXT. LAPP DRIVE 
Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel catching a ride on the bumper. 
RACHEL 
Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors. 
INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM 
As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to Rachel: 
STOLTZFUS Make a poultice... three parts milk, two parts linseed oil... for the infection. 
I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself. 
RACHEL Thank you. 
Stoltzfus turns to Eli: 
STOLTZFUS Lapp, I'll have to speak with the diener on this matter. 
ELI (nods) As you see fit, Stoltzfus. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT 
As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered. 
Book's brow is beaded with sweat. 
Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat- soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on display here just now than she's quite comfortable with. 
She begins to apply the poultice. 
ANGLE 
As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he recoils with alarm. 
RACHEL It's all right! You have got to lie still. 
Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what she says seems to penetrate. He quiets. 
RACHEL (soothingly) Yes, much better... 
ANGLE 
As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so. 
She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her. 
INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY 
He's on the phone: 
SCHAEFFER Looks like we're going to need some help from you folks down there. 
INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY 
Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone: 
UNDERSHERIFF ...want to help any way we can, Chief, but you got to understand we've got upwards of seven thousand Amish over here. 
And that's just Lancaster County. 
INTERCUT SCHAEFFER 
Who is trying to control his impatience: 
SCHAEFFER I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should simplify your work. 
The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down to.

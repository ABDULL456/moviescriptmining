SPICOLI (CONT'D) Let's roll, my man. 
Spicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) Hey, bud! Watch yourselff 
Spicoli turns around to see he's backed into a squad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis. They are all standing on the steps, waiting. 
SURF NAZI Are you Jeff Spicoli? 
Spicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On the end, he sees L.C. 
L.C. That's him! He did it! 
SPICOLI Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but... 
Spicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and into the night. They will never catch him. 
SLOW DISSOLVE: 
INT. RIDGEMONT MALL 
School is out and it's summer business as usual at the Ridgemont Mall. We see the same stores, the same packs of kids roaming the three tiers. 
ANGLE ON MARK RATNER 
who stands against the railing in his Cinema Four jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice Cream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way. The Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her calling out after him. 
STACY Hey Mark! Turn around! 
Ratner turns around, affects total and complete cool. He waves across the mall to her. 
STACY (CONT'D) Come over here! 
He looks back at his post at the theatre, decides it's okay to step away. He walks across the mall. 
INT. SWENSON'S 
Stacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her are two empty stools. After a moment, we see The Rat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds the seat next to him with the palm of his hand. 
THE RAT You. Sit. 
Stacy turns to look at him, smiles. She sits. 
STACY Hi, Mark. 
THE RAT Hi, Stacy. How are you? 
STACY I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year. 
The Rat maintains The Attitude. 
THE RAT Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. 
STACY I know everybody says it, but I really mean it. 
The Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes. 
THE RAT Really? 
STACY Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer. 
She withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it to The Rat. 
THE RAT Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around... (breaks down, takes picture) But I'll give you a call sometime. 
STACY I'd like that. 
She gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and walks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way things sometimes turn out. He slips the picture into his pocket, a satisfied young man. 
INT./EXT. SWENSON'S AND MALL 
The Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed into his street clothes. 
DAMONE She wants it, Rat. 
The Rat snickers, shakes his head. 
DAMONE (CONT'D) I saw you. You had pure Attitude. 
The Rat turns to look at his friend. 
THE RAT The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl. 
DAMONE Whatever you say, Rat.

{"train": "SWORDFISH by \nSkip Woods \nJanuary 2001 Final Production Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \n1   BLACKNESS                                                     1 \nWe hear OVER... \nGABRIEL (V.O.) You know the problem with Hollywood? They make shit. Unbelievable, unremarkable shit. I'm not some grungy filmmaker- wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong-smoke. It's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose. No, I'm talking the lack of realism. Realism. Not a pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision. \nFADE IN: \nINT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING \nThree men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table; STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He is what they used to call a \"cool-cat.\" \nGABRIEL (MAN) Take Dog Day Afternoon for example. Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I, and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they didn't push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it? What if, and here's where it gets tricky. What if they'd started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. What? Still no bus? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                      1 \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) How many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured. \nHe sits, letting the pictures sink in, then: \nGABRIEL Just a thought. I mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if...? \nROBERTS You know, this movie of yours, I don't think it would have worked. \nGABRIEL Really?   How come? \nROBERTS (shrugs) Audiences love happy endings. \nGABRIEL Pacino escapes. With the money. Boyfriend gets the sex change operation. They live happily ever after. \nStanley shakes his head. \nGABRIEL No? \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              1 \nSTANLEY No. \nGABRIEL Homophobia? \nStanley shakes his head. \nSTANLEY Bad guy can't win. It's a morality tale. One way or the other, he's gotta go down. \nGABRIEL Oh, well. Life does tend to be stranger than fiction. (looking at watch) Well, guys, gotta jet. This place is kinda dead. \nCAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop. Not a soul in the place. We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the front door, which is open. Outside the open doorway are crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members, packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside. \nANGLE ON GABRIEL \nGABRIEL Thanks for the coffee. \nHe gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them. Smiles. \nGABRIEL Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in Paris. Bartender says, 'Hey, you want another drink?' Descartes says, 'I think not.' And disappears. \nHe smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to the front door. \nGABRIEL Move. \nNo one even twitches. \nGABRIEL I won't ask again. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             1 \nHe lifts up the device in his left hand. \nANGLE ON ROBERTS \nwho nods his head. The SWAT team moves back, letting Gabriel out of the coffee shop. \nGABRIEL Thank you. \nGabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth. \nGABRIEL (V.O.) On top of that we have taped 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings -- \n8    INT.

Unbeknownst to him, red laser aiming dots appear on Gab's merc's chest. \n10   INT.

STARBUCKS - DAY                                            11 \nRoberts stops short as he hears this.   He and Joy both look at each other. \n12   INT.

BANK - SAME TIME                                             17 \nThe SWAT snipers take this weapon movement as an aggressive act and FIRE into the merc, the BULLETS RIPPING into him. He drops. A SWAT-armored vehicle rushes in -- one of the team jumps out, in an attempt to rescue the woman. \n18   INT. BANK - DAY                                                   18 \nSTANLEY No!

He reaches for her but she fights him. Finally, he grabs her around the waist and carries her on his shoulder into the street as she screams toward the bank for help. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                     19 \nCLOSEUP - HIS FOOT (SLOW MOTION) \nas he steps off the sidewalk. \nANGLE ON GIRL (SLOW MOTION) \nShe is screaming nooooo! \nCLOSEUP - HIS FOOT (SLOW MOTION) \nas it continues its stride. \nCLOSEUP - RADIO DOG COLLAR (SLOW MOTION) \nAround her neck.

According to our source inside the F.B.I., he was nabbed coming through customs at L.A.X. Alone... \nSENATOR REISMAN Do they know who they are dealing with? \nKAPLAN It is unlikely, sir. It was a routine check and Torvalds freaked out. They just got lucky. \nSENATOR REISMAN This ain't good, boys. The Vortex has used Torvalds before. What do the feds know? \nKAPLAN Nothing as of yet. He's refusing to speak English and the Finnish consulate has already contacted the State Department... \nSENATOR REISMAN So we haven't been compromised? \nKAPLAN We're not sure. We're working on that right now. \nSENATOR REISMAN You better get sure real quick, son, 'cause someone's cock's liable to end up on the block on this one. And I promise you it won't be mine. \nKAPLAN Senator, I think we'll be okay here -- \nSENATOR REISMAN I don't fucking pay you to think, Kaplan. I pay you to keep me informed. I know the Vortex. That's why I voted against using him on American soil.

Son, what do you think's going to happen if he starts tying up loose ends. \nThey look at each other. \nKAPLAN Yessir.   I understand. \nCUT TO: \n26   EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY                                    26 \nWe are indeed in the middle of nowhere, no nothing as far as you can see. We CONTINUE TO CRANE UP, a $140,000 Ferrari Modena flies down the road in a cloud of suspended gravel toward Stanley's dilapidated, piece-o'- crap trailer. \n27   EXT. TRAILER - ROOF - DAY                                       27 \nStan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse.     A chained but scruffy-looking Rottweiler runs around in front of the trailer. \nStan looks completely different than he did in the opening sequence. He hasn't taken very good care of himself. His hair is long, and right now standing on end. He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is slicing golf balls off the roof. Whack. \nAs the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at it, but he just isn't very good. Nevertheless, after a dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum hood. \nCLOSEUP - FERRARI HOOD \nCLANG! \nBACK TO SCENE \nStan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel driveway, and turns back to his \"work.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                     27 \nANGLE ON STANLEY \nAs we hear the DOOR SHUT and SOMEONE COMES UP the aluminum extension ladder. \nA few moments later, in SLOW MOTION, GINGER appears at the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof. Stan turns around. \nShe is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a vision. Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice. \nIn the low-rent light of Stanley's white trash haven, she is, by definition, a goddess. \nSTANLEY Who are you supposed to be? \nWHACK (slice). \nShe lights a cigarette, inhales deeply, then exhales. \nGINGER Hello, Stanley. \nShe knows his name. \nGINGER I'm Ginger. \nSTANLEY Is that right? \nWHACK (slice). \nGINGER For someone the N.S.A. has listed as the most dangerous hacker in America, you sure don't look like much. \n30   EXT. STANLEY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   30 \nStanley practically pitches her down the steps of his trailer and slams the door. \nGINGER Shit... \n31   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                        31 \nA TELEPHONE RINGS in a multi-zillion dollar Malibu beach house. A WOMAN, late twenties, grabs the receiver. Her voice is of perfect timbre and accentless. \nMELISSA (WOMAN) Hello. \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED:                                                      31 \nSTANLEY (V.O.) Melissa...

He stands in front of his now closed fridge. It is covered with pictures of his daughter, Holly. \nSTANLEY I want to talk with Holly. \nINTERCUT BETWEEN the two. \nMelissa's accent continues to travel eastward from Midwest flat to full tilt Long Island. \nMELISSA It's... (looks at her watch) It's twelve-thirty, Stanley. She's in school. You know it's illegal for you to talk to her. \nSTANLEY Don't do this, Mel. It's not good for Holly -- \nMELISSA How the hell would you know what is or isn't good for my daughter? You've spent the last two years in prison. \nSTANLEY Mel -- \nMELISSA Stop calling me that, Stanley. \nSTANLEY I just want to see my baby. \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED:                                                       32 \nMELISSA Well, she doesn't want to see you, Stanley, and I swear to fucking God, if you contact her, I'll have Larry's attorney throw you into a hole so deep and dark it'll make Leavenworth seem like two weeks in Vegas; during which I'll personally pay two ball-busting skin-heads to -- \nSTANLEY Wow, Mel, you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl. \nShe regains control.       Her voice is accentless once again. \nMELISSA (exhaling) I will not let myself be manipulated by you, Stanley. Larry's her father now. \nSTANLEY Larry's the porn king -- \nMELISSA Larry's a film financier, a good husband, and an astute businessman. What films he's involved in are a function of profitability and none of your business. \nShe is now downright icy. \nMELISSA Get help, Stanley, get into a program, get a therapist, get a dog, but whatever you do, stay away from my child. \nSTANLEY Your child?    She's our child. \nMELISSA She will never be your child. You'll never have the kind of money to match Larry's lawyers in court. Forget Holly. \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              32 \nCLICK. \nThe PHONE GOES DEAD. \nStanley freaks, beats the receiver against the fridge, again, and again. Then, he calmly hangs up the phone. \n33   EXT. STANLEY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   33 \nStanley walks down the steps of his trailer. Ginger sits on the hood of her car in all her estrogenic glory, smoking and petting Stan's dog. \nSTANLEY What are you doing here? \nStanley's dog leans against her, happy. \nSTANLEY (to dog, like \"traitor\") Judas. \nGINGER Hello, Stanley. \nShe smiles at him. He smiles back, about ready to stick her in the trunk of her car. \nROBERTS Hamlet was a Dane. \nAGENT #2 Adane? \nROBERTS Forget it. \nRoberts sits down in a chair facing Torvalds.     He stares at him a moment, just smiling, then... \nROBERTS Why would the number one cracker in the world risk life imprisonment to enter the continental U.S.? \nLAWYER My client has repeatedly reserved his right not answer any questions at this time. \nTorvalds looks at Roberts' badge and says something in Finnish, the only recognizable word being \"Roberts.\" The attorney and Torvalds both laugh. Roberts looks at the attorney. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           34 \nLAWYER He told me to tell Mister Roberts that he is quite fond of 'The X-Files.' \nAgain they smile. Roberts looks at the lawyer's cup of steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into the lawyer's lap. \nROBERTS You need another cup of coffee -- \nLAWYER (jumping up in great pain) Goddammit! \nRoberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the ass. He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him and locks the door. \nHe turns on Torvalds, smacking him across the face. He pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of him. \nROBERTS Until a year ago I was head of the largest task force on cyber- criminals in the entire world. But, I burned out. It happens. I snapped. I shot a suspect in the fucking hand. Accident. Do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand? \nTORVALDS Whatever you can do to me, he can do worse. I'm already dead. The only place I stand a chance is back in my country. I have friends there. \nROBERTS I tell you what, you tell me what I want to know and I guarantee you'll be on the next flight to Finland. First class. Courtesy of the U.S. Government. \nTorvalds thinks quietly. \n35   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                        35 \nTwo FBI agents (BAD AGENTS #1 & 2) watch the interrogation through a two-way mirror. One of the agents looks surprisingly like Gabriel's merc that carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank earlier. \nTORVALDS (V.O.) (over speaker) I'll tell you what I know. \nThe Agents look at each other.    Bad Agent #1 dials his cell phone. \nBAD AGENT #1 (into his cell) Yes, this is Assistant Director Joy, would you find Agent Roberts. It's important that I speak with him as soon as possible. Thank you. \nINT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nROBERTS Who is he? \n36   EXT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    36 \nA yellow Lamborghini Diablo drives up. In SLOW MOTION Gabriel steps out of the car, wind whipping his full- length, black Gucci overcoat. \nTORVALDS (V.O.) He exists in a world beyond your world. What we only fantasize, he does. He lives a life where nothing is beyond him. \n37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                                  37 \nTORVALDS But it is all an act. \n38   EXT.

For all his charisma and charm. For all his wealth and expensive toys. \n-- exchanging kisses and the lingering of hands, as he slides through parting seas of beautiful people. \nTORVALDS (V.O.) Beneath it all he is a driven, unflinching, calculating machine, who takes what he wants, when he wants, then disappears -- \nCUT TO: \n39   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - ANGLE ON TORVALDS - NIGHT               39 \nTORVALDS -- It works like this. \n40   EXT. EMPTY SKY - NIGHT                                            40 \nTORVALDS (V.O.) I fly to where I am to meet him. He sends one of his people to meet me. \nA BOEING 777 SCREAMS overhead. We TILT DOWN. Stanley and Ginger walk out of LAX. A white LIMO IDLES directly in front of them. \nStanley is wearing a black T-shirt which proclaims in large white letters across his chest, in true Scarlet Letter fashion, \"LOSER!\" \nFaster and faster.       \"ACCESS DENIED.\" \nGABRIEL Three... Two... \n\"ACCESS DENIED.\" \nHe grabs her head.       She doesn't come up.   The screen flashes: \n\"ACCESS DENIED.\" \nGABRIEL Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die. \nMarco puts the silencer to his eye. \nSTANLEY Wait... ! \nCLICK. The GUN is empty. Stanley tries to catch his breath. Helga lifts up her head. Everyone laughs. Gabriel walks around the table. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED:    (6)                                                54 \nGABRIEL I was just fucking with you, Stan. \nStanley is pissed. Helga, smiling, kisses him on the cheek. Stanley tries to calm down. He gets up, shoots someone's half-drank drink, zips his pants, then -- \nSTANLEY So was I. \nStanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around. \nCLOSEUP - COMPUTER SCREEN \n\"ACCESS GRANTED\" appears, and the Department of Defense logo scrolls across the screen. \nWIDER \nStanley gives them all a \"fuck you\" smile, then stomps out through the curtain. \nCLOSEUP ON GABRIEL \nwho smiles. \n55   INT. CLUB - REST ROOM - NIGHT                                    55 \nStanley pushes into the bathroom.       He kicks the wastebasket across the room. \nSTANLEY Shit! \nHe pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. He turns on the water and washes his face. Slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror. Ginger appears behind him. \nSTANLEY What are you looking at? \nGINGER Relax, Stanley. You can do this. \n(CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:                                                      55 \nSTANLEY Get away from me. \nGINGER I want to help you. \nSTANLEY Help? Help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling? \nGINGER It was just a test, Stan, you passed. \nGinger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat. \nSTANLEY A test... I don't know why I let you talk me into this. I can't believe how desperate I am. \nShe exhales toward Stanley. \nGINGER I thought you were here saving your daughter, Stanley. \nHe turns around. \nSTANLEY (pissed) Look... I'd do anything to get Holly back. But, if I end up in a box or back in jail, then I really can't help her, can I? What I should do, is take my money and go back to court. \nGINGER Back to court? Back to Melissa's gladiators? You throw a hundred grand at her, she'll throw five back at you. It's not about Holly, it's about beating you. You know that. Think, Stanley. \nSTANLEY What I'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if I can hack -- \nSuddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom. \n(CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                      55 \nGinger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from PG-13 to an R. \n(CONTINUED) \n60   CONTINUED:                                                     60 \nThey stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows- what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh- graders at the local skating rink. \nStanley nervously clears his throat.    She's got him. \nSTANLEY Can I borrow your car? There's something I need to do. \nShe reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and tosses them to him. Then: \nGINGER If you're going to see your daughter, you might want to reevaluate the way you look. (goes back to her book) Just a thought. \nHe looks at her with open mouth amazement. In just 24 hours, she already knows what makes him tick. \nShe looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns to her reading. \n61   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                            61 \nA SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of all ages come running from the doors. \nANGLE ON HOLLY \nNot your average ten-year-old. Even decked out in bell- bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder. \nShe walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway. Reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus SUVs. She sighs. We CRANE UP, PANNING LEFT. \nHolly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the mayhem. She looks up and down the street then slowly drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. She pulls a well-worn copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer from her backpack, and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her WALKMAN. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n62   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          62 \nNow there is much less pandemonium. No more buses. We CRANE DOWN TO a MEDIUM of Holly still in the exact same spot. Holly sighs, pulls back her headphones and grabs her StarTac from her backpack.

MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                     63 \nThe PHONE RINGS and we PAN AROUND the seemingly empty house, finally COMING TO REST ON the back of the couch. We JIB UP and TILT DOWN. Melissa is passed out in a pool of her own drool. The PHONE continues to RING. \n64   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                        64 \nHolly hits the phone and then presses speed dial. We see \"Yellow Cab\" scroll across the phone. She hits \"SEND.\" \nMAN (O.S.) Can I give you a lift? \nHOLLY Look, creep, I don't think so -- \nShe stands up, ready for a fight. And there, next to her is her father; transformed. Under his arm is a three- foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow. \nHOLLY Daddy? (recognition) Daddy! \nShe runs to him and wraps her arms around him. \nSTANLEY Hey, sweetheart. \nHOLLY Daddy... What are you doing here? I missed you so much. \nSTANLEY Me too, baby.    I brought you something. \nHe holds the stuffed giraffe to her. \nHOLLY Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out you're here she's gonna have you thrown back in jail. \nSTANLEY It's okay, baby. Let me give you a ride home. \nHe grabs her stuff. \nSTANLEY C'mon. \nHe walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh as he carries her to the car. \n65   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                        65 \nThey sit in the CLK, parked down the street from Holly's house. \nSTANLEY You believe in me, right? \nHOLLY Of course, but -- \nSTANLEY I've found a way to get you back, sweetheart. It's my one shot and I'm taking it. Just give me a couple of days. \nHOLLY (crying) I don't want anything else to happen to you, Dad. \nSTANLEY Holly, everything's going to be okay. You just have to trust me. \nHOLLY (crying) I love you, Daddy. \nHolly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying, from the car at full speed, with the giraffe. \nDARK SUIT #2 Why didn't you do that earlier, sir? \nRoberts looks at the agent. \nDARK SUIT #2 Sorry, sir. \nROBERTS Go get him. \nThree of the agents bring Stanley over. \nStan slides down by the back wheel. \nROBERTS What are you doing in L.A., Stan? \nSTANLEY (catching his breath) Vacationing... \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:                                                      69 \nROBERTS Why were you running? We just wanted to talk. \nSTANLEY Are you arresting me? \nROBERTS For violating your parole by leaving Texas without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me killed in the process? \nStan just looks at him. \nROBERTS No, I'm not. \nSTANLEY Then why are we talking? \nROBERTS Didn't know the court lifted the sanction preventing you from seeing your daughter. \nSTANLEY Fuck you. \nROBERTS You just want to cut through the pleasantries and get down to business? Fine. I can help you with your daughter, Stan. Help me, I'll help you. \nSTANLEY You'll have to forgive me, the fact that you put me in jail for 18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust. \nROBERTS Whether I agreed with what you did or not, you broke the law, Stanley. \nSTANLEY I guess we were both doing what we had to. This was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you're not arresting me... \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               69 \nROBERTS So, why was it you are in L.A. again? \nSTANLEY I told you -- \nROBERTS -- vacationing. That's right. Ya know it's funny. Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. Isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time. \nSTANLEY I'm a sucker for Disneyland. (getting up) Tell Torvalds I said hello. \nROBERTS If you're not careful you can tell him yourself. He's dead. \nStanley looks at Roberts. \nROBERTS (to his men) Give him a card. \nThey do.   Stan looks at it. \nROBERTS In case you think of anything else you want to tell me. \nStan turns to walk off. \nSTANLEY (to the agent he elbowed) Sorry about your nose. \nROBERTS Hey, Stan. \nStan turns. \nROBERTS You know, you're in way over your head here. \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 69 \nSTANLEY (walking off) I know. \nROBERTS It's a long walk back up the hill, Stanley. You want us to give you a lift? \nStan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the long journey back up the hill. Roberts collapses into the passenger seat. \nROBERTS Follow him. \nRANDOM AGENT Yessir. \nStanley looks at Ginger for a beat. \nSTANLEY Actually... \nGinger stares at Stanley, who turns to look at Gabriel. Gabriel looks at Stan, waiting. \nSTANLEY Thought maybe you'd like to see me get you your hydra. \nGABRIEL Get? \n(CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 70 \nStan walks toward Gabriel. \nSTANLEY C'mon. \nGabriel walks into the hall. Stanley looks back at Ginger who mouths the words \"Thank you.\" Stanley ignores her. Ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed. \nGABRIEL (O.S.) You look like shit. Ginger kick your ass? \nSTANLEY (O.S.) (deadpan) Funny. \nGinger sighs and tosses her gun onto the bed, then follows them. \n71   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                          71 \nStanley, looking a little rough, sits in front of the huge array of flat-panels. He works quickly. The nitrogen system, an array of hoses winding across the living room floor, intermittently SHOOTS JETS of GAS upwards, dropping the temperature to a livable 85 degrees. Gabriel sits next to Stan. \nGinger walks in.      She stands behind Stan as he works. \nGINGER Miss me? \nSTANLEY Terribly. \nCOMPUTER \nThe screen shows the MIT University logo.

In the basement and through a file room is the only P.D.P.-10 still active and on the internet, although only a few people know this. It's an I.T.S. machine and kept online just for historical sake.

We INTERCUT as they speak. \nGABRIEL (irritated but respectful) Senator, I sincerely hope you did not contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this. \nREISMAN Goddamn right I did. You know where I got that? From the deputy director of the F.B.I. He thought I might be interested. \nGABRIEL Sir, with all due respect. Do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of? \nREISMAN We are aborting the operation and securing alternative means of finance elsewhere. \nGABRIEL What? \nREISMAN We are aborting this operation.

But if he ever bites you, even once, you gotta put him down. You can't have an uncontrollable weapon running unchecked in your back yard. He becomes a liability. You never know who he might bite next. \nKAPLAN Yessir, I understand. \n88   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                 88 \nStanley works at the keyboard.

GABRIEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                         89 \nStan walks to the fridge. Opens the door. No wine. He sighs. He closes the door and walks off toward the wine cellar. \nGABRIEL Hold the wheel. \nGabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun, compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60. \nSTANLEY Shit, it's blocked. \nGabriel looks behind them, another black Suburban has blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third comes toward them down the alley. \nGABRIEL Keep it straight. \n(CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                92 \nThe speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they SCREAM backwards. \nGabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP. He clips it and pulls back the bolt. He grabs the wheel from Stan. \nGABRIEL It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon. \nANGLE ON LAMBO \nAs the Diablo slams backwards into the Suburban at sixty mph. Bam. \nGabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open roof and UNLOADS FULL-AUTO into the Suburban. The armor- piercing SHELLS PENETRATE the Armalite GLASS, RIPPING the occupants to shreds. \nGabriel turns, FIRING at the other Suburban. \nGABRIEL Drive, drive! \nStanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged under the Suburban. \nGABRIEL Go, go! \nGabriel continues to BLAST FULL-AUTO, tearing the Suburban to shrapnel. \nSTANLEY I am! \nFinally the mortally wounded but still kicking Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- on toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac. \nGabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver. The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack. \nStanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main street. \n(CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                92 \nMore Suburbans head at them. Stan SCREAMS left into another alley. Through the cross streets whipping by at 100 mph, we see Suburbans parallel to them. \nStan cranks his wheel right. \nSTANLEY Shit! \nGABRIEL (changing out a clip) Keep your cool, Stanley. \nThe Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running at the Suburbans. \nAfter a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's over. \nGabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns over the body and looks at the face. \nGABRIEL Goddamit.   I knew it. \nGabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where Stanley stands. \nGABRIEL Get in the fucking car, Stanley. \nSTANLEY I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. \nGabriel pulls out his H&K, points it at Stanley. \nGABRIEL You're on my good side and you want to stay there.

I just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street. I'm just fucking great. It doesn't matter if I get my daughter back if I'm dead. Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You? \nShe walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on his leg, looks up at him. \nREISMAN The F.B.I. was watching you -- \nGABRIEL I told you there was nothing that I was unaware of -- \nREISMAN That's why we're here. You are too arrogant, too aggressive -- \nGABRIEL You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator. You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do. \nGabriel pulls out his H&K, dangling it by his side. \nREISMAN (arrogantly) And what are you going to do with that? \nGABRIEL Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people. \nGabriel shoots Reisman in the chest.     He falls into the water. \n98     INT.

The money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years. 'Course it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours. The power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. But, you kill me and you never get a single dollar. \nGabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of RPMs. \n(CONTINUED) \n123   CONTINUED:                                                          123 \nSTANLEY You let the hostages go and then I'll tell you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I can't break through the fire wall. It's my act of God policy. (beat) Deal? \nGABRIEL I'm thinking. \nA very tense moment passes.      Gabriel looks around.   He has an idea. \nGABRIEL Tell ya what.    No deal. \nMarco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30- foot-high ceiling buttresses. \nGabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. \nGABRIEL Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley! \nMarco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable. \nSTANLEY No, don't do this. \nStanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her fingers. \nTwo mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. \nStanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \n123   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               123 \nGABRIEL In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known. \nSTANLEY (freaking) What are you doing? Stop! \nGABRIEL String up the D.E.A. bitch. \nMarco hits the power switch. Ginger is yanked up into the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor. \nSTANLEY Just let her down.

She smiles at him and slowly bends forward to whisper in his ear. \nCLOSEUP - GINGER'S MOUTH \nat Stanley's ear. \nGINGER (very slowly) I am not what you think I am. \nANGLE ON GINGER AND STANLEY \nAs she leans back. She stares at him a moment then slides off the desk. \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                59 \nGINGER You're a smart guy, Stanley.    You figure me out. \nShe hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been drinking, and then grabbing Stan by the belt-buckle, pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \n60   EXT. POOL - DAY                                                  60 \nLounging by the pool is none other than our heroine, Ginger, topless, wearing nothing more than tiny, oblong, green-tinted shades, a skimpy T-back, and a little silver ring through her left nipple. She's reading Steven Hawkings' A Brief History of Time. A shadow falls over her. \nThe shadow moves.       Ginger glances nonchalantly up, then: \nGINGER (sitting up, grinning) Don't you have that just-fucked- the-neighbor's-cat look this morning. \nShe reaches over, lights a cigarette, and inhales deeply. He smiles, looking her up and down. \nGINGER Problem? \nSTANLEY Pretty impressive. \nGINGER I thought we went over all that last night. \nSTANLEY (beat, then like \"stupid\") The book, Ginger. \nGINGER Ohhh. (holding it out) Look, no pictures. Get out of my light. \n", "test3_input": "GABRIEL One. \nSTANLEY Let her go. \nStanley jumps up and runs over to Marco.        Gabriel puts his gun to the back of Stanley's head. \nSTANLEY Now, goddammit, it's done.   Let her go! \nGabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with a different laptop. He nods. Marco drops the girl. \nGABRIEL Well, that was fun. \nA MERC holding a cell phone. \nMERC Joy says the plane is ready. \nGABRIEL Well, 'bout time for us to leave. \nSTANLEY They'll never let you escape.

Choppers drop out of the air, shadowing the bright yellow school bus. \n126A   EXT.

I don't think any of us want a repeat of this morning. Keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times and I want the airspace for five miles clear. \n127    INT.

So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat.' \nGabriel, smiling, turns to Stanley. \nGABRIEL Whaddaya think, Stanley? \n", "test3_true": "GABRIEL Really? Five hundred bucks says I do.

Behind the bus, a huge caravan of police cars and SWAT trucks follow. \nGABRIEL Stan, c'mere. \nStan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with Gabriel. All the hostages' eyes are on him. At the front he looks at Gabriel. \nGABRIEL Take a look. \nCops block off side streets as the convoy, ala The Gauntlet, rolls through L.A. \nGabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a hundred miles. \n133A   INT.

He grabs him, pushing him. \nSTANLEY How the fuck can you justify all this? \nGABRIEL You're not looking at the big picture. \nGabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail. \nGABRIEL Stanley, here's a scenario. You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases. But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child to save the world? \nSTANLEY No. \nGABRIEL You disappoint me, Stanley.   It's the greatest good. \nSilence for several beats. \nSTANLEY How about ten innocents? \n(CONTINUED) \n133A   CONTINUED:                                                       133A \nGABRIEL Now you're getting it.   How about a hundred? \nGabriel becomes intense. \nGABRIEL How about a thousand? Not to save the world, but just to preserve our way of life. \nSTANLEY No man has the right to make that decision. You're no different than any other terrorist. \nGABRIEL You're wrong, Stanley. Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each? I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount. \nThe driver, looking at his watch, says something to Gabriel in French. \nGabriel replies to the driver, also in French. \nCLOSEUP - DRIVER \nas the driver shifts down. \nCLOSEUP - DRIVER'S FOOT \nPressing down the accelerator. \n(CONTINUED) \n100A. \n133A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  133A \nCLOSEUP ON SPEEDOMETER \nNudging toward eighty. \nSTANLEY What the fu -- \nGABRIEL I saw Sugarland Express, Stan.

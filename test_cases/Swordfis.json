You know the problem with Hollywood? They make shit. Unbelievable, unremarkable shit. I'm not some grungy filmmaker- wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong-smoke. It's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose. No, I'm talking the lack of realism. Realism. Not a pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision. \nFADE IN: \nINT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING \nThree men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table; STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He is what they used to call a \"cool-cat.\" \nGABRIEL (MAN) Take Dog Day Afternoon for example. Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I, and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they didn't push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it? What if, and here's where it gets tricky. What if they'd started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. What? Still no bus? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                      1 \nGABRIEL (CONT'D) How many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured. \nHe sits, letting the pictures sink in, then: \nGABRIEL Just a thought. I mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if...? \nROBERTS You know, this movie of yours, I don't think it would have worked. \nGABRIEL Really?   How come? \nROBERTS (shrugs) Audiences love happy endings. \nGABRIEL Pacino escapes. With the money. Boyfriend gets the sex change operation. They live happily ever after. \nStanley shakes his head. \nGABRIEL No? \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              1 \nSTANLEY No. \nGABRIEL Homophobia? \nStanley shakes his head. \nSTANLEY Bad guy can't win. It's a morality tale. One way or the other, he's gotta go down. \nGABRIEL Oh, well. Life does tend to be stranger than fiction. (looking at watch) Well, guys, gotta jet. This place is kinda dead. \nCAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop. Not a soul in the place. We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the front door, which is open. Outside the open doorway are crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members, packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside. \nANGLE ON GABRIEL \nGABRIEL Thanks for the coffee. \nHe gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them. Smiles. \nGABRIEL Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in Paris. Bartender says, 'Hey, you want another drink?' Descartes says, 'I think not.' And disappears. \nHe smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to the front door. \nGABRIEL Move. \nNo one even twitches. \nGABRIEL I won't ask again. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             1 \nHe lifts up the device in his left hand. \nANGLE ON ROBERTS \nwho nods his head.

Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues across the sidewalk and into the street. \nHe nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the soundtrack. \nPandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky- loos are packed together into the distance. \nSharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in the world. \nSlowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street. \nGabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus, under a huge \"WORLD BANC\" sign, and through the glass front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE. \n3   INT.

Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor, surrounded by broken glass. Between them rests a bright red Ferrari F50 (Gabriel's). \nAll but one of the front windows of the bank, the one with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch plate steel. \nOver two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms cable-tied behind their backs. Something has been duct- taped around their chests and each is wearing what appears to be a dog collar. \nThe other occupants of the room are nine men. All of whom would look as if they were attending the fashion event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons each one carries. \nGABRIEL How we doin'? \nOne of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar on a young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara, whimpering blonde girl. \nMARCO (ARMED MAN) Done. \nGABRIEL Good.   Take her out. \nSUPERIMPOSE:    FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18     8:41:22... \nThe front door opens and one of the suited men drags out the pretty blonde from earlier.

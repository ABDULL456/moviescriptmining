CLEAR (CONT'D) (a warning) Get outta here! 
CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house. 
ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY 
is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard. 
ALEX 
is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby. 
ALEX What... what happened? 
Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly. 
MR. WAGGNER Didn't you... "see" it? 
Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction. 
MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D) Couldn't you "predict" it? Couldn't you read his mind? Alex remains silent, hurt. 
ALEX Mr. Waggner... 
MR. WAGGNER You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that... (breaking down) He took his own life. 
Alex is stunned, defensive. 
ALEX He wouldn't do it! 
Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof." 
ALEX He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself? 
MR. WAGGNER All my wife and I will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son... if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane. 
Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle. 
The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers. 
ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD 
Clear is gone. 
FRONT YARD 
everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES 
A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk. 
A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod." 
CLEAR  (O.S.) Almost Autumn. 
Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor. 
ALEX It's only the end of June. 
CLEAR (shrugs) Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. (beat) Almost like bein' able... to see the future. 
Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage. 
INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY 
Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that. 
CLEAR Know what this is? 
She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal. 
ALEX Like, um... you're mad about something? 
She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal. 
CLEAR A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach. 
ALEX You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits. 
CLEAR It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you. 
Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear... 
ALEX Why were you there last night? 
While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine... 
CLEAR Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide. 
Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf. 
ALEX Why were you there last night?

DIEGO In your present state it is madness, Father! 
FERNANDO glances at DIEGO. 
FERNANDO Nobody is forcing you to come with us. 
DIEGO is hurt. 
DIEGO I can't go anyway. 
A pause. 
FERNANDO She's very beautiful!  The Queen has very good taste.  Diego is getting married. 
DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.  Once again DIEGO feels like the outsider. 
COLUMBUS hugs him. 
COLUMBUS I am happy for you, Diego. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY 
Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on either side of ISABEL. 
SANTANGEL Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred times!  But the man is still remarkable. 
ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point. 
SANTANGEL All he asks is a chance to explore this... mainland. 
SANCHEZ It does not belong to him. 
SANTANGEL (quietly) In a way, it does, Don Sanchez. (to the Queen) I beg Your Majesty to receive him. To hear him... He will make no more demands.  He has changed.  He is penitent. 
SANCHEZ Penitent...?  He is suing us for breach of contract! 
ISABEL Is he? 
She starts to laugh. 
ISABEL Really? 
SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing. 
INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY 
COLUMBUS is shown into the room.  ISABEL is waiting for him. 
He drops to his knees before her.  This time she walks towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other signs of physical deterioration. 
Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console him.  Her hand is dying to comfort.  But instead, she offers her hand for him to kiss. 
ISABEL Rise... Please... 
COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they meet hers, are as clear as before.  ISABEL smiles with relief to see it.  He looks back at her. 
COLUMBUS Now I do look older than you. 
She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps her dignity. 
ISABEL We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world... 
COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a gesture. 
ISABEL But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent. 
COLUMBUS Thank you. 
ISABEL There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this? 
COLUMBUS Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am. 
She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns slightly, then goes out. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY 
SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has obviously been listening.  He looks at her. 
ISABEL I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.

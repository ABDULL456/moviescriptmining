She looks at him. 
BRESSANT You want to find your daughter? 
HELENE Of course. 
POOLE Then you need to tell us. Where is it? 
HELENE With Ray. 
BRESSANT And where's Ray? 
HELENE Chelsea. 
BEATRICE Three days, Helene? You've known this? And she could be alive? 
BRESSANT Let's go. 
(INDICATES PATRICK) She rides with you. I don't want her in my car. 
ANGIE'S CAR, CHELSEA - DAY (MOVING) 
INT PATRICK   & 
Patrick drives. Angie rides shotgun. And Helene slumps in the backseat. They drive without saying anything. Helene looks up at Patrick. 
PATRICK Helene, you went to St. Mark's? 
HELENE Yeah. Did you? 
PATRICK I was freshman when you were a senior. You were with Scott Flaherty? 
HELENE Oh, him? He stabbed a foreign exchange student in the chest. Got life. He's a faggot now. 
Beat. 
PATRICK Seemed like he was already a faggot in high school. 
She laughs. 
HELENE You're terrible. 
She smiles, 
PATRICK How did the money end up with Ray in Chelsea? I thought you went home after. 
HELENE We dropped off Amanda, went back to Ray's then fuckin' retarded Ray left his rock at my place-- right then I was like 'I'm dropping this motherfucker, I don't care if he does have a big dick' so we went back to the apartment, he was, hollerin' and gonna wake up Amanda, who needs her sleep, so we went back to Ray' s. Ray' s mother's, whatever. I don't know where the mother is but she left all her fuckin' cats and it smells like cock in 
THERE-- 
PATRICK Cheese never contacted you? They never left a note? 
HELENE No. We never heard nothin' from them. That' s why Ray said don' t say shit . 
Patrick and Angie look back and forth. 
ANGIE You didn't think it was worth it, for your daughter's sake, to tell people what happened? 
(BEAT) Cheese has your kid right now. God fuckin' knows what he's doing to her. What do you think Amanda would give to come home ? 
HELENE What am I gonna do? Call Cheese and be like-- do you have my daughter? 'Cause I ripped you off and I'm just checkin'? 
Patrick says nothing. 
HELENE (CONT' D) 
(DEFENSIVE) Am I gonna tell the cops "I run heroin in case that' s irrelevance?" 
PATRICK The cops never asked you about Cheese before? 
HELENE No. 
PATRICK What if Ray already spent the money? 
A beat. 
HELENE Nigga, please. I hid it. 
She rolls her eyes. 
HELENE (CONT' D) Pull over. 
CUT TO: 
INT RAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
All, save Helene, stare at something just off camera. Angie's hand to her face. They register a beat of stunned silence 
BROKEN BY : 
BRESSANT Christ. . . 
ANGLE ON : RAY LIKANSKI ' S DEAD BODY. 
He has been tied to a chair in his kitchen. Gunshots are what killed him and the condition of his corpse suggests death came as a relief.

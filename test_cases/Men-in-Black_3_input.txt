BEATRICE And they said to me, "If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?" And I must admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him. It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit. 
A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase, notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to skin a deer. 
JAY Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an alien... 
BEATRICE Sorry? 
KAY Go on. 
BEATRICE Anyway, when I came to, he was gone. 
KAY Did he say anything? 
BEATRICE Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember. 
KAY Sugar water. 
JAY Did you taste her lemonade? 
Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to Jay. 
Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him. 
KAY Ray Bans. (pulling off Jay's sunglasses) Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus -- 
JAY Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one? 
KAY Standard issue neuralyzer. 
JAY And that's the best you can come up with? 
KAY On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off. 
JAY (butting in) Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 
KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow. 
JAY (from up outside the hole) Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those memory things? 
The spectral analyzer turns blue. 
KAY When you're ready. (re: analyzer) Please -- not green. 
Purple. And then green. 
Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him, JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him. 
KAY (CONT'D) Do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail? 
JAY Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night. 
AT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone. 
KAY (softly, into mic) Zed, we have a bug. 
He turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him. 
JAY I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad. Right? 
KAY Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species. 
JAY So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms? 
KAY Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun? 
JAY What do we do? 
KAY With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY 
ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. 
A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. 
INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

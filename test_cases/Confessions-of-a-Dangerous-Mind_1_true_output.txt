PENNY See, I believe in the brotherhood of man. Last week I got fucked by an Oriental. (beat, studies him) What are you? 
BARRIS Jew. 
PENNY That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi (pronounced Ashkuh-Natzee), I'm guessing. 
BARRIS Ashkenazi. 
PENNY Right. Ashkenazi... I haven't balled one of them. 
BARRIS You're a romantic. 
PENNY Eh, I just don't get into all the bullshit between cats and chicks. 
BARRIS I know what you mean. 
PENNY (not hearing him) You know what I mean? 
BARRIS I know what you mean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PENNY Besides, you fall in love with a cat, you only get hurt. Right? 
BARRIS Don't I know it. 
PENNY (beat) We could ball if you want.     I seem to like you pretty well. 
BARRIS Well, that would be good. But, you know, I'm kind of here with Debbie. It doesn't seem right. 
PENNY Yeah. That's true. I didn't think of that. (getting up) Well, I'm going to bed. Nice meeting you. 
Penny shakes his hand and heads off. 
BARRIS What's your name? 
PENNY Penny. 
BARRIS I'm Chuck. 
PENNY Oh, you're the one who wrote that Palisades song. I love that song.     It's such sentimental bullshit. 
Penny exits into her bedroom.   Barris drinks his beer. 
INT. BARRIS'S TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY 
Barris and Penny are having sex on the kitchen floor.      It's quite passionate. 
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - LATER 
Penny is taking a bath in the tub in the kitchen while Barris broodingly cooks dinner at the stove. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PENNY (animatedly) ... so this ape and I were looking at each other. It was, like, across time and evolution. Then he began to talk, but it was a language I didn't understand, maybe Swiss. Then he turned into Perry Como, real square and... what's wrong with you? 
BARRIS Nothing. 
PENNY Just because we fucked, doesn't mean there are strings now. It's okay. 
BARRIS Okay. 
PENNY Okay? I only wanted to tell you my dream is all. Nothing more complicated than that. Don't panic. 
BARRIS I'm just used to all this dating bullshit, y'know. Now we're a couple. Now I'm obliged to give a shit what you say. 
PENNY Don't worry about it, I'm not into those games either. So, anyway, this monkey turns into Perry Como and I say -- 
BARRIS Holy fuck! 
PENNY What? 
BARRIS Holy holy fuck! (runs over, kisses her) You just gave me an idea. (starts pacing For a show! Fuck! 
PENNY A show about monkeys? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BARRIS In a way. About the craziest monkey of all: Monkius Humanius! Don't you see? About people! About sex. About romance. About the bullshit of dating! 
INT. LEONARD GOLDBERG'S OFFICE - DAY 
Leonard Goldberg, ABC executive, sits behind his desk as Barris, holding a cardboard model of a game show set, excitedly paces the room giving a pitch. 
BARRIS I call it The Dating Game, Mr. Goldberg. And that's what it's about. A pretty girl asks three handsome guys, who she can't see, silly questions. And based on their answers, she picks one to date. And we pay for the date. That's it! That's the show! It's got everything!

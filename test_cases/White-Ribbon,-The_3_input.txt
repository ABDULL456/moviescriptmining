PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher stands up and says: 
SCHOOLTEACHER: Come here, I'll play something for you. If you'd like that. 
She thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly. She follows him, as he goes and settles in front of the harmonium. She sits on a bench nearby. He starts to PLAY. 
36. FARM. PIGSTY. INT/EXT/DAY The farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not very big. The pigs grunt excitedly because of the disturbance. Suddenly, Franz enters. FRANZ: Good morning, Father. The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody had come in. Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent. After a while, they've done their work. Ignoring Franz, the farmer goes outside. Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, says to him as he goes out: FRANZ: I'm back again. They set me free. At this, the farmer stops and turns around. He looks Franz right into the eyes: FARMER: I can see that. So what? Franz bows his head. Paul, who has followed his father, out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at his brother. The farmer goes over to the fountain and washes himself. Franz follows him slowly and stops beside his father, who keeps ignoring him. After a while 
FRANZ says (softly): Can't you forgive me, Father? The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz: FARMER: What do you want me to forgive for? That the estate won't give me any work now? That Leni has been fired in disgrace? That your brothers and sisters soon won't have anything to eat. Is that what you mean? Or is it something else? 
37. COUNTRY ROAD AND DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY The CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and the schoolteacher. NARRATOR: The next day, after school, I went to the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to intercede for Eva's reinstatement. We were told the Baroness had left that morning with her children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a carriage to take Eva home. An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from the opposite direction. The passengers of the two carriages greet each other. The CAMERA follows the Doctor and looses Eva and the schoolteacher. The doctor has one arm in a sling. The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property. The driver helps the doctor get out. Xenia comes running out of the house and greets her father. The driver unloads the luggage. The doctor and Xenia go into the house. 
Just as we were leaving the village, we met the doctor. A few days after the Thanksgiving feast, Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly disappeared. Of course, everybody was terribly upset in view of all the previous occurrences. Finally, he was found walking down the road, scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly toward the town. When he was asked where he was going, he said he wanted to visit his father. Seems he fought tooth and nail against being taken home. Somebody must have told this to the Doctor. Since he was scheduled to be released from medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an end to his stay at the hospital. 
38. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY BACK TO THE SCENE. STAIRWELL. DOCTOR (calls several times): Rudi? He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xenia shrugs her shoulders, clueless: 
XENIA: He was in the living room a short time ago.

CHIEF (back at the helm) Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another. 
CHEF Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash. 
Lance grits his teeth, FIRING -- 
143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN 
144  POV BEHIND CLEAN 
He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction -- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy burst at the jungle -- trees crumble. 
CLEAN I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a- bitch, it's jammed, oh God, it's jammed. 
Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE. 
Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead. He looks angrily to Willard. 
Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward the cockpit. 
WILLARD Throw me that ordnance. 
Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over the edge of the cockpit. 
WILLARD (continuing) Give me some kind a field a fire -- 
BULLETS rip by. 
CHEF (exhausted) We're through. 
He climbs aboard and collapses. 
CHEF (continuing) Oh, God -- 
LANCE (FIRING) I ain't finished ! I ain't finished ! 
WILLARD Bring that bow ordnance into those trees. 
He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the jungle. 
145  POV. - BEHIND THEM 
He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly. There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin- ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES. 
146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF 
He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead. Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79. 
147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R. 
The boat slams through the hyacinth growth, moving through the river, FIRING BACK at unseen enemy in the jungle. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
148  FULL VIEW ON THE P.B.R. - TWILIGHT 
The boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide, flat area in the river. 
149  MED. VIEW 
The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded. They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be- cause they know they're too far from the banks to be shot at. 
They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount. The boat is a floating wreck. 
Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack by Chief. All of the men are silent. 
Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the shoulder. 
CHEF There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell. 
WILLARD How much is left? 
CHEF Less than half -- sure is a mess down there. 
Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic sack. 
WILLARD And the grass? 
CHEF Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other. 
Chief pushes Clean's body into the river.

He notices something in the distance. 
151  WILLARD'S POV 
A light. 
152  MED. VIEW 
Willard stands up, pointing up the river. 
WILLARD Hey. 
They all look over.

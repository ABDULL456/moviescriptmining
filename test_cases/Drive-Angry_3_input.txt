MILTON Someone else. 
PIPER Is there anyone not trying to kill you? Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then -- 
PIPER Come on. I'll help you. But we're dealing with that first? She points to his blood soaked shirt. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT 
The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky. 
INT. GTO - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER The needle hovers at 95 mph. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads. 
MILTON My daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college. 
PIPER She knew him? She knew Jonah King, the man they think killed... She stops herself. 
MILTON She knew him. The world was in a fuckin tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution. He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357. 
MILTON It was four months before she realized âquiet' meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off chickens. 
PIPER Jonah King was into voodoo? Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically. 
MILTON Voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn't into. When she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. Gassed up her car. Cooked her a hot meal. Then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron. 
PIPER Jesus. She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands. 
MILTON She learned her lessen. Was a good little follower for eighteen months. That's when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown. It was Chinese New Year so the place was wall to wall slants. She saw her chance, stabbed Jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd. 
PIPER Milton. Your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didn't know? Why didn't you help her? Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight. His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber. 
MILTON I didn't find out about any of this until...until I got locked up. Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut. Shoves it into his duffle. 
PIPER Not gonna reload? 
MILTON Only had three bullets to begin... 
PIPER Milton. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an accident. Milton eases the shotgun into his lap. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN 
Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is overturned on the shoulder. 
INT. GTO - DAWN 
PIPER That's his truck. 
MILTON Stay put. I won't be long.

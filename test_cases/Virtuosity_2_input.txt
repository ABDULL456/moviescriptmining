MADISON (a beat) What's wrong with Parker? 
LINDENMEYER (innocently) How should I know? 
MADISON (getting an idea) Show me his physical sensory level. 
She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the console, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%. 
LINDENMEYER I wonder how that... 
MADISON (CONT'D) Turn it down! 
Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%. 
ON A MONITOR 
Parker immediately returns back to normal. His pace picks up. He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6.7 as he races into a shopping mall. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL 
The place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping. An atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second floor. Then the third. 
Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator. 
Throwing people out of his way. 
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR 
which is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. 
Parker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots Sid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun sight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM! 
Parker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet in his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as a shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker arrives behind a marble column. 
SID 6.7 (surprised at Parker's ruthlessness) We really aren't that different, are we? 
What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head. 
PARKER (whispering) Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it? 
Affluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from behind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds its mark. 
Absorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium railing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the railing. 
PARKER'S POV 
Sid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control. 
Speeding toward the ground seven floors below. 
SID 6.7'S POV 
The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes. 
FROM THE FIRST FLOOR 
Sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you. A 200 pound rock. WHAM!!! 
He lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bone crushing. Sid 6.7 does not move. 
Until he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to his body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds, his body appears as good as new. 
(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be Auto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.) 
Sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off. 
SID 6.7 Man, what a rush. (yelling up to Parker) Adios, amigo! 
Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby. 
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR 
Parker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE LETAC 
Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING LIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body lying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned. 
MADISON What's wrong?

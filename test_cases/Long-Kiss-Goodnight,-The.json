{"train": "\"THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT\" \nby \nShane Black \nREVISED DRAFT \nFebruary 24, 1995 \nA WINDOWPANE \nAssaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed. \nINSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS... Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR, as a soft voice says: \nVOICE Shhhhh. \nAnd there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling eye. \nLITTLE GIRL Mommy, the men on the mountain...! \nMOM Shhhh. Gone, all gone now. (strokes her hair) I'm here. Mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you. Safe now... safe and warm... snug as a bug in a rug. (beat) I'll sit with you, think you can sleep? \nLITTLE GIRL Turn on the nightlight. \nThe mother nods. Passes her left hand gently over the girl's forehead. \nMOM Close your eyes now. I love you. \nThe child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT -- \nHer entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun. \nShe staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed. The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the glass. \nFADE OUT. Pause. Blackness. \nFADE IN: \nIt's snowing in southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled in the rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia. SUPER the legend: \nUPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO. Three Weeks Earlier. \nPeaceful. Serene. It's the town in the glass bubble, the one God shakes to watch it snow... \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nCHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from loudspeakers. \nHAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his \"Ho's\" in groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off. \nBeside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things: First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman. For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE. \nSAMANTHA How you holdin' up? \nEARL Freezing my nuts off. \nSanta produces a bottle of Seagrams. Starts to open it. \nSAMANTHA *Put that away*. \nEarl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl from a street corner: \nBURNOUT Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT! \nSamantha squirms in her seat, scowling. \nSAMANTHA I can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving me crazy, but there's these *kids* here -- \nEARL Right, you don't wanna be rootin' -- \nSAMANTHA In front of little Billy, age four, yeah. \"Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses to go butt-mining.\" \nEARL This is little Billy talking? \nSAMANTHA Age four, kid's unbelievable. (sighs) I'm too old for this, Earl. \nEARL Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate the size of a melon. \nSamantha stares at him. \nEARL Seriously, half my life's a doctor's hand up my ass, I should marry the fucker. \nSAMANTHA Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it. \nEARL It's not that fucking little Billy again, is it? \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \nSamantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody reflection takes a long, satisfying drag. \nREFLECTION Relax, you can drop the act. Nice and smooth, take another hit. There you go. See how easy it comes back? \nThey are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily. \nREFLECTION *I'm* coming back. You know that, don't you? Name's Charly, by the way. You're gonna love me. \nThe reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH. \nINT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY \nBack at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind. \nHAL Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong about this. \nSAMANTHA I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I know it. \nCAITLIN Daddy, make her stop! \nSAMANTHA Hush. Go to the garage and get me something, anything. A veggie, go, man, go! I'm hot to trot. \nINT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME \nHal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door. \nHAL Tomato. \nCaitlin turns, tosses it to Sam -- \nCAITLIN Tomato. \nWho catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur. Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a mad mumblety-pegger -- \nHAL Onion, flying in. \nSam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up. \nSAMANTHA More. Faster. \nAnd it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another, she giggles, starts throwing them overhand -- \nCAITLIN Tomato. Tomato. Tomato. \nAnd now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up Caitlin -- \nSamantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think: Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance. Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to the wall, KA-CHUK--! \nEveryone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks. \nSAMANTHA Uh... chefs do that. \nINT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL \nUnderground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces hum and tick in the sweaty gloom. \nA SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him, what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in the eye as the guy blubbers: \nMAN Please, man... I don't know why you gotta kill me... But use the gun, not the knife. Please. As a fucking favor, I'm begging you... \nTIMOTHY It'll be over soon. \nMAN Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the knife... Shit, I can't handle getting shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...! \nTIMOTHY Last chance. What do you know about a town called Santa Claus? \nMAN What is this, *what the fuck is this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you can't do this to me. I don't know ANYTHING. \nTimothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied. \nTIMOTHY No. You don't. (beat) I can always tell, you know... If someone's lying to me. A little skill of mine, something to trot out at parties. \nHe slams home the knife. We don't see it, but we FEEL the impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches away from Timothy, their eyes lock... \nA CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it from his belt and flips it open: \nTIMOTHY Timothy. \nVOICE (O.S.) Message from Mr. Daedalus. \nTIMOTHY I'm listening. \nHe shrugs at his captive. Rolls his eyes. The guy's still dying, still on the KNIFE. \nVOICE (O.S.) He says he's sorry, but he needs you right away. Something's come up. \nTIMOTHY Nix. I'm just finishing up here. Then I'm going bunjee jumping. \nVOICE (O.S.) He's aware of your weekend plans, and he apologizes. \nShe hoists her onto the seat. Caitlin cries and hollers. \nSAMANTHA You gonna be afraid of things all your life? Huh? That what you want? \nCAITLIN My wrist hurts...! \n*Snap*. Something lets go. Suddenly Samantha's right in her face: \nSAMANTHA Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you *will* ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, *is that understood*...? \nEyes cold and lifeless. She is not herself. CUT TO: \nINT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT \nCAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter- top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone, saying: \nSAMANTHA Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas station... Right. Thank you Mr. Henessey, I'll see you shortly. \nShe hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes: \nHAL She rode all the way home. She didn't fall, not once. She didn't cry. (beat) You're good. You should work with kids, you know that? \nSAMANTHA She said her wrist hurt. I didn't know it was broken, God. I can't even remember what I said to her...! \nHal takes a breath, composes himself. \nHAL We can still make six o'clock mass, you coming? \nSam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers: \nSAMANTHA A private detective's coming by, he... he's found something. (beat) I may have to go away. For a bit. Now please leave me alone. \nHAL Go away. With a detective. Jesus, it's the holidays, Sam -- \nSAMANTHA Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Go to church. Drink blood. Drink some for me. \nThey stand in tableau. An electric silence... Broken quite suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside the front door. The sweet strains of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" wafts in through the window. \nExcept the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at each other, what the hell...? \nEXT. THE FRONT PORCH - JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR - NIGHT \nTHE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE- 109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on bottom. You'd sing shitty too. \nINT. HOUSE - SAME \nSamantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive M&M's. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS. Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door. Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK. \nONE-EYED JACK Evening Charly. Long time. \nHe swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass shatters, M&M's everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck, unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, live or *die* -- \nSHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers -- \nCAITLIN Mommy...! \nSAMANTHA GET OUUTTTTT!!!! \nSam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave, useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS, over and over on broken ribs -- \nJACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs. Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of the stairs, paralyzed. \nSAMANTHA NO!!!! \nJack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward her daughter -- \nJACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter -- flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...! \nEXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME TIME \nTwo stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and unhurt. \nBACK INSIDE THE HOUSE \nSamantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK. Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nShe hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum, slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--! \nA GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind. \nONE-EYED JACK I want my eye back, bitch. \nSamantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf -- Slams it against her head. \nONE-EYED JACK Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong with you, *fight* me! \nCLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in the face. \nINT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY \nAn old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers: \nWALRUS MAN The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things. I'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if I'm lyin'. \nHenessey lights a cigarette, says: \nHENESSEY Do me a favor. Say, \"Always after me Lucky Charms.\" \nANGUS \"Always after me Lucky Charms.\" \nHENESSEY Thanks. Just needed to hear that. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nDrab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner. \nHENESSEY See anything you recognize? \nSAMANTHA Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look. (sighs) I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge. \nShe pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in her eye... says softly: \nSAMANTHA I can feel her. Like a ghost. (beat) We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just... leave her dead. \nShe hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp breath: \nSAMANTHA Ay-i-yi! \nClothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest, the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags: \nSAMANTHA Size four, no way. You know how long it's been since I could wear a size four? (beat) Can't be mine. Can they...? \nShe checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...? \nHenessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear. Holds up a small manila envelope. \nHENESSEY Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a guy. \nSAMANTHA What's in it? \nHENESSEY Another guy's address. Two addresses, is basically what I'm saying. \nMeanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam looks like she just took a stomach punch. \nUp until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything. She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it. \nHENESSEY Anything else in there? \nSAMANTHA Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes. \nHENESSEY Yeah, well take a look at this. \nHe holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*. Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO: \nINT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nNATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid- seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself. Windeman scowls: \nNATHAN Alice, please...? \nAlice stares at him. Uncomprehending. \nNATHAN Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive. \nALICE What's wrong with the dog? \nNATHAN It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. *Wouldn't you agree*? \nTheatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up: \nNATHAN Hello? \nThe voice is soft. Controlled: \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd like to speak with you. \nNATHAN Who... who is this? \nSAMANTHA You tell me, Mr. Windeman. \nNathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages: \nNATHAN ...Charly...? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) My full name, please. \nNATHAN God, it really is you...!? Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks -- \nNow Henessey shivers. Cranks the wheel as we CUT TO: \nEXT. HILLTOP - OVERLOOKING TOWN - NIGHT \nSAMANTHA flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees. \nHENESSEY Where the shit did you get that? \nNo answer. She deftly assembles the SNIPER RIFLE. Rests the rifle barrel on a dead branch. Flicks on the starlight scope. \nHENESSEY Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill someone! Hey! \nShe ignores him. Focuses through the scope. POV SAMANTHA: Framed in spectral GREEN, the diner's interior. Hostages. Crying mothers. Children, catatonic. \nThrough a tiny window -- a limited view of the KITCHEN. He's in there. Girl, eating both barrels. Samantha's jaw tightens. \nHENESSEY The diner...? That's half a mile away, are you fucking crazy? \nSAMANTHA HK M-40 assault rifle. At three hundred yards, vertical drop six inches. \nMr. Shotgun leans in. WHISPERS something to the waitress. \nSAMANTHA Shit. He's gonna do the girl. \nHENESSEY How the fuck can you tell? \nShe steadies the rifle. Takes aim. \nSAMANTHA I read lips. \nShe fires. Splintered CRACK-! \nINT. DINER \nMr. Shotgun dies on his feet. Outgoing matter. Flung. Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt hamburger. He drops. Screams. Pandemonium. \nEXT. HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER \nSamantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the passenger side without a word. Henessey pulls away. \nINT. CAR - DRIVING - SAME \nSamantha stares straight ahead. Gives a high, brittle laugh. \nSAMANTHA See? Took care of it. Knew I could. \nShe laughs again. Henessey favors her with a look reserved for people with major deformities. Suddenly she says: \nSAMANTHA Pull over. \nHe stops the car. She gets out. Stumbles across the shoulder. Kneels. Throws up. Henessey watches. Lights a smoke with trembling hands. \nSAMANTHA Had to, he... he would've killed her... Had to... Oh God I took him, such a good shot... I felt proud of it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I be proud*...? (sobs) I'm scared... I want to go home... \nHenessey kneels beside her awkwardly. She clutches his shoulder. Presses her head to his chest. Cries. \nEXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nYes, it certainly is. CUT TO: \nINT. SITUATION BRIEFING ROOM - SAME TIME \nThree stories below the White House proper. THE PRESIDENT is seated in his robe and slippers. Before him sits a panel of three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the CIA; and ANOTHER MAN in his sixties, sporting a distinguished mane of silver hair. The President addresses him: \nPRESIDENT *Mister Perkins*. (frowns) Please, say it again, I'm a little slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on TV in a Christmas parade. \nThe silver-haired man appears unperturbed. And no, by the way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with Caitlin's TEDDY BEAR, the one Mom named -- He nods, says: \nSILVER-HAIRED MAN On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks old, intelligence just caught it. \nPRESIDENT You recruited this woman in the late seventies? \nSILVER-HAIRED MAN For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of her father's, you see, and... I took her in. \nPRESIDENT Well, it looks like she returned the favor, now doesn't it? (throws up his hands) Unbelievable. You people, you dump this on me, then next week you're screaming, \"Where's our funding?\" Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can you say health care? \nThe head of the CIA pipes up: \nCIA DIRECTOR Mr. President, please calm down. The CIA bears no responsibility for this problem. \nPRESIDENT Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many double agents you got on the payroll, last count...? \nCIA DIRECTOR Sir! That controversy has been thoroughly dealt with, and if there still exists a leak, perhaps this... woman agent of his -- \nSILVER-HAIRED MAN If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore hasn't had classified access since (beat) But thank you, Kent, for trying to fuck me in the ass. \nHe directs his baleful gaze at the President. Lights a pipe. \nSILVER-HAIRED MAN I'm afraid rooting out double agents may have to wait. The primary threat is the woman. Her specialty is counterassassination, a horseshit turn of phrase which implies the other fellow shot first, but in point of fact she's a takeout artist of the first order. Nearly disposed of our friend the Beard down in Cuba a few years back. Specializes in long rifles, accurate to a mile and a half. Presumed dead; now, after eight years, back in the field, agenda unknown. She knows enough to hurt us. I'm frightened. Understand? \nHe pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares. \nSAMANTHA That's it? That's your helpful story? Jesus Christ! \nHENESSEY No, see, all's I'm saying is you're not alone. \nSAMANTHA Oh, shut up. \nHENESSEY Fine. I gotta use the head. \nHe stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette. The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her. She turns... \nThe assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away. \nTIMOTHY For you. Another in a long line of bad investments. \nSAMANTHA Excuse me? \nTIMOTHY Just saw the ring on your finger. \nHe reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says: \nTIMOTHY Do I know you from somewhere...? \nGrimaces: \nTIMOTHY Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line, let's forget I said that. \nStill staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION on her features. She gives him a cursory smile. \nSAMANTHA Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't know you. \nTimothy nods slowly. \nTIMOTHY No, you don't, do you...? I'd know if you did. I can tell if someone's lying. (smiles) Sorry to bother you. \nHe takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar, whispers into a concealed transmitter: \nTIMOTHY Okay, people, I got what I needed. Wait until she comes out. Then do them both. (beat) Walk soft, we got local law. \nHe sits back as TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES suddenly enter, doffing their stetsons. Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow. Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door. \nSAMANTHA (sotto) What are you doing? \nHENESSEY Pork. On your nine. \nSAMANTHA So? \nHENESSEY So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside. \nSAMANTHA It's freezing. \nHENESSEY Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves. During that show with the little girl who's a robot. \nEXT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - SAME TIME \nThey emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey, points -- \nA LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops. \nSAMANTHA Bingo. That's an old guy's car. \nHENESSEY How do you know? \nSAMANTHA Because there's an old guy in it. Come on. \nThey cross toward the car. She frowns, points to his coat. \nSAMANTHA Gun bulge. \nHENESSEY You think I'm gonna shove it down my pants? Shoot my damn dick off. \nSAMANTHA So now you're a sharpshooter? \nHENESSEY Ho, ho. \nAs they approach the other car, the engine stops. The door opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He pauses, lighting a cigarette. \nSAMANTHA Mr. Windeman...? \nShe strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a SILENCED PISTOL. \nSAMANTHA Oh, SHIT! \n*Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS: \nShe clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another, BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting -- \nSam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*. Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand, wondering how in the hell it just did that. \nHENESSEY *What happened to bulletproof*? \nNATHAN *The side windows were next, I swear*. \nBACK WITH TIMOTHY \nWatching them go. Oh, well. He tried, right...? Did his best, tomorrow's another day -- \nWithout missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of the road. ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast- approaching windshield. Kills the driver. \nThe car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing juggernaut, immense...! \nHe vaults the hood without breaking stride. Catches the drive- side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the corpse and the car *never stops moving*. \nCompletes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water... and then he's stomping the gas. Utterly relentless. Leaving behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse. \nINT. STOLEN CAR \nTimothy GUNS IT, eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre -- Hears a SCREECH. Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: POLICE CRUISER. Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar. \nINT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME \nNathan fishes a gun from his coat. Hands it to Samantha. \nNATHAN Here, you might as well have one too. \nSAMANTHA My God. How many do you carry? \nNATHAN Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr. Wally -- (pats his groin) Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin. \nHenessey looks out the back windshield, says: \nHENESSEY Got a tail. \nNathan looks, SWEARS. The chase car's gaining on them. \nNATHAN Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest. \nHe accelerates into a curve. Rockets past a connecting road, as, without warning -- ANOTHER COP CAR skids out of the side road, after him. The other deputy... \nTIMOTHY, boxed. Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car careens into a GULLEY -- \nBAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares continuously. \nUP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his crippled black-and-white. \nTogether they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS. They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom of the gulley. \nINSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door. Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He puts a shot through the radio. Silences it. \nClimbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath... \nEXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON \nNathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police cars go by on the distant highway. \nNATHAN Your father was in the British SIS, assigned to the Irish situation. After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the U.S. State Department. \nCharly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to: \nNATHAN Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down. You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus. You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier. \nSAMANTHA Would you lay off the weight? \nNATHAN I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I can't drive around in this thing. (beat) Any idea where we can go to stash this car? \nIN SAMANTHA'S LAP \nHer fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp, crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left. \nSAMANTHA This address...? I... I recognize it now. I think it belongs to a friend. \nHenessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope, his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is soaked with blood. \nNATHAN Perhaps you'd best drive. \nEXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY \nThe house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump. Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around the corner -- \nDrops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN, sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says: \nSAMANTHA Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you. (beat) I just want to know who you are. \nSeeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping BEAR HUG, shouts: \nMAN CHARLY, BABY!! \nPicks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and Nathan stare. Befuddled. \nNATHAN Arms broker, man without a face. Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades. He's rumored to be based in the U.S. Doesn't travel much, they say. Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg. \nAt which point, Henessey stops. Frowns. \nHENESSEY Come again? \nNATHAN A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin. \nHe scuffs his shoe in the porch dust. Eyes narrowed: \nHENESSEY Where the hell...? I know I just heard that somewhere, something about a... \nHis eyes widen: \nHENESSEY Oh, fuck. \nPoints to the lake: \nHENESSEY Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in *his* leg. \nNathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently: \nNATHAN You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus! \nHENESSEY Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew all that shit, not from *dating* him -- she *studied* the fucker to take him out! \nHe takes off for the lake at a dead run. Behind him, the bloodied Nathan DRAGS himself to his feet and lurches off the porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing to go down. \nAT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't -- A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside, TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional. \nFIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says: \nLUKE Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it? \nSLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken doll. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nBlack indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or long ago... \nA TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy. The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp- looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter: \nBRIGADIER ...the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, as you know, is the counterpart of the provisional IRA and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary groups. \nAn ANNOUNCER's face replaces him: \nANNOUNCER Despite threats of reprisals, Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut UVF supply lines, especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. President Nixon concurs that... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nA battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date as June 23, 1971. \nIN THE NEXT ROOM \nGirlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake, dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket. She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns, satisfied. \nOne last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door. She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits. Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out. \nEXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT \nThe boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin. Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin. \nGREGORY You've never made it with a boy, then? \nGIRL There's nothing odd about it. I'm only sixteen. \nGREGORY Rubbish. \nGIRL What? \nGREGORY You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing. \nGIRL Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my father, we never stay in one place, I never meet bloody anyone. \nGREGORY Saw him on the telly. Think he'd kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am. \nHe slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb. \nGREGORY You know what, I'll bet you've never even kissed a boy... now, have you? (beat) Aye, but you want to... \nHe leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch. \nAcross the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat. She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked. Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes only then that the guy is LAUGHING. \nGREGORY Thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody Papist bitch. \nHe slaps her full across the face. \nGREGORY Tell the press the Ulster Force claims full credit. \nDAEDALUS Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot you in the head. Nice and quick. Otherwise, you're in for a long night. *Who did you talk to*? \nSAMANTHA ...Nobody... fuck you... \nHe shakes his head, makes a \"tsk tsk\" gesture. Smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch. \nDAEDALUS Hate to see you like this, Charly. I heard you were a helluva spy once. \nWithout warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice, not her own: \nSAMANTHA Watch your back. I'm not done yet. \nDAEDALUS That's a very funny joke. You're an entertaining woman. Good night. \nHe hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads. \nUNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan, mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In a flood. Stark and vivid. \nMEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR \nTHE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky. Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals -- \nThere's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the trunk. Nods. \nTIMOTHY Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting, and Jack...? Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, try to play doctor first. I made that mistake. \nThe lid SLAMS SHUT. \nBACK UNDER THE WATER \nThe world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster and faster -- \nMEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness. Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA) is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched. \nONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt. \nHer eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE -- \nThen she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car... Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots her. In the head. \nShe pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller -- \nINT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT \nHere. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath. SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD -- \nBy her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half frozen. \nDAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine, watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile. \nCHARLY Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let me go now...? I'll leave you the use of your legs... Bargain, trust me... \nDaedalus struggles to recover his poise. \nDAEDALUS How did you find me? Who knows about this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD? \nCharly's eyes bore into his: \nCHARLY I let you touch me, cowboy... I think I need a bath. \nDaedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time. \nUNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME \nHere we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN. Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now there's RAGE. \nIt takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist... But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME. \nShe darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS -- \nHideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr. Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage inside her. Death in her hands. \nMEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE \nThe wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing. \nThe first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel. Incredible. \nDoesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDaedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen, REBORN, from the icy waters. \nDAEDALUS Samantha... Please...! \nCHARLY Who's Samantha? \nShe shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says: \nCHARLY I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY ASKED ME. \nShe storms out. CUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME \nCharly stalks the city streets. A quartet sings, \"God Rest Ye Merry,\" ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total misfit. Searches her own haggard features in a shop window. Swallows hard, whispers: \nCHARLY Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, no way. Bitch is dead. \nShe bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets. That's when a tall BEARDED MAN crosses the street and falls in alongside. \nBEARDED MAN Good evening. \nCHARLY Fuck off. \nBEARDED MAN I see me a good-looking lady, all upset, I wonder if she doesn't need some male company. \nCHARLY Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I get raped. \nHis hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38. \nBEARDED MAN Step into the alley, honey. I ain't asking, I'm telling. \nCharly stops walking. Regards him the way you or I might look at a telephone cord. Groans: \nCHARLY Oh, don't tell me. You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. Go away and come back at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got a light? \nThe guy stares, mouth working. \nBEARDED MAN Lady, I have a gun! \nWhich is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson COCKS next to his ear: \nVOICE (V.O.) This ain't no ham on rye, pal. \nHENESSEY holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. Charly spins on him, eyes flashing: \nCHARLY What the hell are you doing here? \nHENESSEY Saving your life. Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line. \nCHARLY You think I couldn't take him? *Idiot*, you probably scared the other guy away -- \nHENESSEY What other guy -- ? \nCHARLY Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons? \nHENESSEY I TOOK LESSONS. \nThe hitman watches, bewildered. Considers waving to get their attention. Finally he can't stand it. Blurts out: \nBEARDED MAN Hey! \nCharly snaps her head toward him: \nCHARLY *What*? \nBEARDED MAN I still got this fucking gun! \nShe smiles sweetly. \nCHARLY No, you don't. \nTakes it off him. Just like that. He stares dumbly at his empty hand. Half of his trigger finger is missing. \nBEARDED MAN SHIIIIT!! \nCharly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK. Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards. \nCompletes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES. Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside -- \nBEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE meant for Henessey arcs through the air... \nImbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead. Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking. \nCHARLY Fuck you. Just fuck all of you. \nEXT. ATLANTIC CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME \nA BRONCO ROARS UP out of a parking garage. Swerves and plunges into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most popular board game. \nINT. BRONCO - SAME \nCharly drives, possessed. Henessey drinks. Hands shaking. \nCHARLY Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that prick. \nShe throws a shrieking skid. Henessey clutches for the dashboard, swearing. \nCHARLY Good morning, Raymond. \nRAYMOND Um... morning, Ms. Caine. \nCHARLY What did we learn about the dangers of smoking...? Give it here. \nA wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long, satisfying drag. Passes it back. \nCHARLY Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll blow your fucking head off. \nMoves off through the bushes. Out of sight. \nEXT. CAINE BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER \nCharly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches, face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and slips inside. CUT TO: \nINT. GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN - DRIVING - SAME TIME \nThree GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure. \nAGENT #1 Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just to follow it back to the ass it came from. \nAGENT #2 Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast. \nA RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says: \nVOICE (O.S.) Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more pass, let's make sure the house is secure. \nEXT. CAITLIN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nCharly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling. \nCrosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck. \nWe hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible, the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns. Crosses to the window, lifts the sash. \nPause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE. Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down the weapon. Scans though the gunsights... \nPOV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir of children, singing... CAITLIN among them. \nCharly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE... \nEXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nHenessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner behind him... \nBACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE \nWatching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS in rapid succession. \nShe's up and moving. All else forgotten. \nEXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nHenessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government SEDAN close behind -- \nThe upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through. Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits, rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES. \nGovernment sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off -- \nINT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - DRIVING \nThe driver looks over, incredulous. \nDRIVER He's dead. Goddammit, how did that happen?? \nBACKSEAT *Go bulletproof, now*! \nThe driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate exposed to the world. \nBACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE \nCharly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes off around the house at a dead run. \nINT. ST. PAUL'S - SAME TIME \nSwitch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform. \nTwo seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving, child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney: \nTIMOTHY Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're about to have 2.4 children. \nFreezes her. Petrified. \nTIMOTHY I know where you live. Close your mouth, you look like a fish. Merry Christmas. \nHe exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional. \nMEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH: \nCLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass. \nTIMOTHY (O.S.) I want money, Charly. I know you've got numbered accounts, we all do. I'll let you know where and when. Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees. \nCHARLY You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*. \nTIMOTHY I'll be in touch. \nHe hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL: \nThe .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T operator. THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled. Charly points to the switchboard: \nCHARLY Give me an ANI trace. Do it. \nEXT. PINE-COVERED MOUNTIANS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING \nSet back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign: *Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty pole. Blinks forlornly. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nTIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the room: \nTIMOTHY It's done, she hooked. All I gotta do is set the ransom meet. \nPERKINS She mustn't suspect a trap. \nTIMOTHY No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, remember? Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate. \nPerkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her. Next to a brown paper bag. \nPERKINS God. We're monsters, aren't we...? (pause, then:) Forget Charly. Talk to me about tonight. \nTIMOTHY The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy. (points) What's in the sack? \nPerkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly. \nPERKINS That...? Something to prove that I'm not a complete ogre. \nHe reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL. Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow. \nPERKINS See? The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas. Very popular item. It... well, it pees. You put water in it and... oh, fuck you. \nINT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK STATE - TWILIGHT \nCharly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS! *Where it's Christmas all year long*! \nHENESSEY Almost dark now. \nCHARLY Another ten minutes. You want my Crazy Meal action figure? \nHENESSEY Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing? We've got money, we could negotiate... \nCHARLY *I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's dead weight if she's sedated. \nHENESSEY Not so emotional, I'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here. \nCHARLY Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I can. This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy. \nHENESSEY Yeah? How come you know so much about this fucking guy? \nCHARLY Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know. \nHENESSEY I'm here. Suppose you tell me. \nCHARLY Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back in \nShe knows she's shocking him, rubs it in: \nCHARLY I'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember...? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch...? \nThe look in her eyes is feral. \nCHARLY It's almost dark. Let's get it done. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHTTIME \nFull dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck. \nEXT. SURROUNDING MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME \nIn the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss Nightvision binoculars. \nWelcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow. Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars, head in hands. \nHENESSEY What's the matter? \nCHARLY They're here. \nHENESSEY Who? \nHenessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters beneath her...! Plunges into blackness. \nINT. CELLAR - PITCH BLACK \nShe hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights: \nShe's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor. \nCharly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER. Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed. \nA GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then. Deadly serious: \nVOICE (O.S.) I smell gasoline, you have a little accident...? I got plenty of matches up here. Bad way for a kid to go. Thirty seconds, think it over. \nCHARLY stands in place, mind racing... Caitlin's DOLL. Regards her dully. Plastic smile like it knows a secret. CUT TO: \nINT. MOTEL - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHTTIME \nA MATCH FLARES as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... MR. PERKINS puffs mightily. Turns and favors CHARLY and HENESSEY with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator... TIMOTHY straddles a nearby chair. Smiles and says: \nTIMOTHY Good to have you back again, Chuck. \nPERKINS You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules of the game anymore. \nCHARLY No shit. Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown. Now you're working *with* him. \nHe crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside. \nPERKINS Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets. \nPause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers: \nCHARLY Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that* what this is about...? The foot soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!! \nComprehension, dawning. She looks up in disbelief. \nCHARLY You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you...? All you need is a major terrorist incident. \nPERKINS Interesting theory. \nCHARLY Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming... (eyes widening) No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, *just to get a budget increase*. \nPerkins shrugs philosophically. \nPERKINS It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing...? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job. \nCHARLY That's not gonna happen this time...? \nPERKINS No. This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. This time the terrorists can't muck it up... because we've killed them and taken over. \nCharly and Henessey react, startled... \nEXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHTTIME \nOn the move. Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound. Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two dyspeptic GUARDS, each keeping a safe distance. \nA POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his shoulder. Holds out his hand: \nPOCK Found these buried around the perimeter. \nTimothy studies it: C-4 CHARGE with remote detonation unit. \nTIMOTHY Make sure you get all of them. \nThe agent rushes off. Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully: \nTIMOTHY Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss... No sense lyin', I'm miffed. \nMoves like lightning. WHACK-! Kidney shot. Charly stumbles, vision going black. Fights for balance. Henessey starts to react but a GUN MUZZLE stops him. Charly straightens. Grits her teeth, says: \nCHARLY So what's the plan? What's going out in the tanker? \nTimothy and the guards exchange looks. Cracking up, they can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing. Looks at Timothy with hooded, lifeless eyes: \nCHARLY What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I wanna know. \nTimothy lights a cigarette. Studies Charly. \nTIMOTHY You wanna know the plan? \nHe casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas lights twinkle. \nTIMOTHY Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A. personified. We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it. Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot. We evacuate. The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas morning... Main Street looks like a meteor strike. \nHENESSEY Are you fucking insane? You're talking about 10,000 people!! \nCHARLY Easy, Mitch. (to Timothy) How you gonna blame it on terrorists? \nTIMOTHY Those roads are treacherous this time of year. When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get the picture? \nHenessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS. Pegs one into the wall with deadly accuracy. \nTIMOTHY Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it. \nHENESSEY Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds. \nTIMOTHY We'll be gone by then, Mitch. \nHENESSEY Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early. Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just watch. \nTIMOTHY Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed. \nHENESSEY Who? \nTIMOTHY Me. (chuckles) Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter. \nHenessey reacts, startled. Timothy chuckles: \nTIMOTHY Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find...? \nHENESSEY The patsy. \nTIMOTHY Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst... (beat) The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now. \nINT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME \nCHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes. Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy. Lying flat, she appraises her work -- \nA TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently takes the doll from her, then: \nCHARLY Open. \nReaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER. \nMust be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer... \nInverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back: \nIt pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through the brick -- into the other ROOM. \nNot much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll. Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to her. What next..? \nShe grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH -- One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...? Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down. \nCHARLY Gimme a spark... show me, show me... \nTries again. And again. STRIKING, over and over. Floor RINGS with the effort -- \nCHARLY Come on, come on... do it...! \nBut in the end, it's just not gonna happen. *Won't work*. Lets go a GROAN of despair: \nCHARLY All this, just one fucking match, *Goddamit*...! \nShe collapses forward. Cradles her head in frustration. There's a tiny tap in her shoulder. \nCAITLIN Mommy...? \nCharly looks up, face haggard and depleted... Caitlin's eyes, alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST and brings out a pack of matches. \nCAITLIN Don't cry. I keep these here. (beat) For lighting your candle. \nCharly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift. \nThe bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it. Under innocent eyes on Christmas Eve DETONATES, blown sky-high, and she sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming... \nCHARLY I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much I love you...? \nCaitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face. \nCAITLIN Am I gonna die...? \nFrom a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home. Charly's eyes, like steel. A harsh whisper: \nCHARLY No, baby, you're not gonna die. They are. \nShe strikes a match. \nINT. SECOND STORY INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME \nHenessey, straining against his bonds. Sweating. \nTIMOTHY Charly's stash. What's the number of the locker, Mitch...? \nHENESSEY Fuck you. \nTIMOTHY across the room, a good forty feet. \nTIMOTHY Left nut, five bucks I make it. \nUP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE \nThe Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS. \nBACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING \nLifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand -- \nSlaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop. \nDoesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver SWEARS. \nShe raises her gun. Fires without blinking. \nPuts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as \nCHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR \nCrosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another. She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of her tires on the road behind her. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - TOWN OF SANTA CLAUS - CHRISTMAS EVE \nMilling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay of the film's opening, as \nEXT. STREET - SAME TIME \nThe gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point: the innocuous PANEL TRUCK. \nThe temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME TIME \nCharly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox. Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the car, gun held low, and meanwhile -- \nINT. CAR - DRIVING \nTIMOTHY barks orders into a mic: \nTIMOTHY All units converge. Divert local law, this is a government matter. Brook no interference, I want the Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's the fucking chopper*? \nRacing toward the edge of town and meanwhile \nON THE PARADE ROUTE \nSANTA CLAUS himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a rock star and wishing his groupies were legal... when suddenly he's got company. \nCHARLY I'm the Missus. Drive. \nThe rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt. Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as \nINT. PLUSH LIMO - SAME TIME \nMR. PERKINS hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny VOICE issues from his headset mic: \nVOICE (O.S.) ...yes, she's with Santa Claus, correct, er, excuse me, the individual *playing* Santa, er... they're pursuing the tanker truck, sir. \nPerkins stares straight ahead, speechless. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - HEADING OUT OF TOWN \nSIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance, and meanwhile \nTWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS \nCome whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them. CRACK--! Gunshots, shattering the stillness. \nEXT. TRUCK CHASSIS - SAME TIME \nA RICOCHET whines off a hydraulic cable. Spurt of fluid as the BRAKES start to go, and meanwhile \nBACK ON THE SLEIGH \nCHARLY throws herself flat next to Santa. \nCHARLY Sorry, man. Government agents, high level conspiracy. \nSANTA Fuckin' government. \nThe SEDANS jockey for position, try to pull ABREAST -- Charly swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through. She hands the reigns to Santa. \nCHARLY Veer left. \nSANTA Away from the truck? \nCHARLY Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own that fucking truck. \nSanta complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST of them. It's what she wanted. \n*FIVE SECONDS*: \nCharly flies back. Hits and SLIDES. Fetches up against a bannister, WHAM--! Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him. Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*. \nTIMOTHY Call it four minutes to detonation. I got a chopper on the way, lots of time. \nHe sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE. Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife. \nCHARLY Oh, honey. Only four inches...? \nTIMOTHY You'll feel me. \nHe approaches, almost casually. Charly staggers erect. Adopts a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand. \nINT. PERKINS' LIMOUSINE - SAME TIME \nPERKINS hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset: \nVOICE (O.S.) Point team leader, reporting... She's... incapacitated the truck... I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm dying... Instructions...? \nPERKINS Continue dying. Out. \nHe leans back. Stares sightlessly. Loosens his tie, hits the intercom and says: \nPERKINS Anthony, get me the President... \nHe takes out a bottle of Scotch. CUT TO: \nINT. CHAPEL - SAME TIME \nCharly and Timothy. They circle, two pros. \nTIMOTHY You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles never recovered from C-section, I'll bet. Am I right? \nNever watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the HANDS... The gathered saints look on, neutral. \nCHARLY Please, man... She's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl... \nHis concentration never falters as he says: \nTIMOTHY She's a worthless bitch. I know it 'cause she came out of me. \nHe LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of one arm and FLINGS her, up and over...! She SAILS through space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers forward. They circle... \nTIMOTHY It's called shock, Charly... Your body wants to go into shock... \nCHARLY Fuck you, your breathing's lousy... \nCharly LAUNCHES herself. Avoids a stab at her throat, eats that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back GASPING. \nCircling again. Charly cannot walk a straight line. \nTIMOTHY Look at you. You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie. \nCLOSE ON CHARLY \nShe looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red, and in those eyes we glimpse it; the DEMON, laughing... as Charly whispers: \nCHARLY ...You want a piece...? Take my shoulder. \nHe lunges with the knife...! She ducks, trips on purpose and HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate -- \nAnd WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the bastard's KNEE, wide open... \nBoot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister -- \nGrabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--! \nCharly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it. \nTakes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up and over, flailing...! Drops from sight. \nCharly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God... \nThere's a hole in her chest. \nEXT. SEMINARY - NIGHTTIME \nThe doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe. Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid. Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts. \nTHE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD \nThe PILOT brandishes his radio mic: \nPILOT Got her. Heading for the tanker, thirty yards out. She's all over the place, something's wrong with her. \nWITH CHARLY \nLeft foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her. \nCHARLY *Cover your ears*. \nCHARLY Distract him, for God's sake give me ten seconds, please, I'm begging somebody, anybody, *she's my daughter*...! \nEXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT \nA sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands before a row of cars and the Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat. Lifts the mic to his lips and says: \nCHAPTER BEAUROCRAT Negative, ma'am, we understand your request, but we've decided to go ahead and let this play out... \nBehind him, the back of the panel truck EXPLODES. A car CATAPULTS outward into space -- SMASHES DOWN atop two sedans. Blows out their windshields. Flings itself to the pavement and RICOCHETS forward, zero to sixty. \nMITCH HENESSEY \nAt the wheel. Making a suicide run. Face a FRIGHT MASK of deadly purpose. We have no idea why someone who looks like him is alive. \nINT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME \n*Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the CAR. \nTIMOTHY Where are *you* going?? \nTimothy grabs the stick -- THAT'S WHEN CHARLY BREAKS COVER. Does a MAD STAGGER across the blacktop. Goes for the GUN. \nTIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING in low and fast -- \nCHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and falls flat on her back, points it skyward: \nCHARLY Suck on it. \nShe fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing. \nHead over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, SHRIEKING--! \nCHARLY Die screaming, motherfucker. \nShe watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody in the moonlight... \nHERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning. \nHenessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...! KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says: \nCAITLIN Hurry! The truck is a bomb! \nHENESSEY Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof...? No, Caitlin, *don't check*. \nHe PEELS OUT. \nCHARLY Hey... you're bleeding... \nHENESSEY I think that's yours... \nCHARLY Right, sorry... \nHe inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly. \nCAITLIN *You're a bad driver! Who said you could drive*? \nEXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME \nThey have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming: \nTIMOTHY *Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*! \nThat's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown like rockets in every direction. \nTIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out of control... \nStrikes the tanker. Boom. \nImagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS. \nEXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME \nHenessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into and out of the trees, peekaboo... \nSome go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors, GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams: \nCAITLIN Don't hit the cars! \nHenessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete... \nThen they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement. \nOVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St. Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO: \nEXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME \nHenessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly: \nHENESSEY Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...? \n", "test1_input": "INT. BARREN GREY OFFICE - NIGHT \nTHERE'S THE GIRL. The one in bed moments ago. She and Henessey are dividing a wad of bills. \nGIRL We gotta stop using bums. \nMITCH (lights a smoke) Forget it. They looked like cops. We pulled it off, didn't we? \nGIRL It was embarrassing. \nMITCH You want I should hire actors, for Chrissake? These guys are cheap, they work for food. \nGIRL Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over you is that, like, a refund? \nMITCH Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here, you're so funny. What's this? \nHe indicates an envelope earmarked for him. Labeled in magic marker: SAMANTHA CAINE. \nTRIN New case, honest to God chick with amnesia. You want the job? \nHenessey opens the envelope. Extracts a black and white HEAD SHOT of Samantha, says immediately: \nHENESSEY Yep. Yep, yep, yep. \nStares, mesmerized. Trin peers over his shoulder: \nTRIN Wasn't there a lady on TV named Samantha? Had a magic nose or something. \nHENESSEY 'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right? \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT \nSAMANTHA and HAL bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors. Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher. \nHAL Christ, guy's all over you like a cheap suit. \nSAMANTHA That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit. \nShe notices EARL sitting in the bushes by the side of the building. He is speaking intently to the gerbil. \nHAL Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my father home. I'm plowed. \nSamantha takes the keys from him. Breathes deeply of the chill night air. Smiling. Surveys the scene... their friends. The neighborhood. Sighs: \nSAMANTHA This is all I ever wanted. \nAt which point, young Caitlin says: \nCAITLIN How would you know? \nESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME \nSwitch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled. \nINT. PRISON - TELEVISION VIEWING ROOM - EVENING \nA tired TV set drones to an audience of one. Let's call him ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's give him one eye, the other replaced by a PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on the chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances at the TV screen. \nNEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.) ...So much for the flame-swallowing Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile, KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky, where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle turned out to celebrate her hubby's worldwide tour. After one look at her, I'm thinking Santa got what he wanted this Christmas. \nThe happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack isn't talking or breathing either. He's simply STARING at the TV screen, jaw slack... \nONE-EYED JACK Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No way. SHIIIT!! \nHe SCREAMS as we CUT TO: \nEXT. WOODLANDS - WITH SAMANTHA - DRIVING \nIf you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer one. A country highway. Bathed in moonlight. Crusted with snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending its way through the wooded slopes. \nINT. SUNBIRD - SAME TIME \nSAMANTHA drives while Earl (the SANTA we saw earlier) reclines, still drunk. \nEARL You're married what now, five years...? \nHe makes a thumb circle. Jabs his finger in and out of it: \nEARL You and Hal, how often you two...? \nSAMANTHA Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? Every chance we get. Shut your piehole. \nEARL Don't get all snippy... \nSAMANTHA Earl, do me a favor. Every few words say \"hic\" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay? \nEARL Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a drunk man have this much raw talent? \nHe starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear, she can't help it, snorts laughter -- \n", "test1_true": "And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether. Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through -- \nBut the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING. Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage. A FLAILING HOOF takes out Earl. Kills him in less than a second. Collapses his skull. \nSam rides the wheel, screaming. An antler gouges her chest. Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits the tree doing \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood... And then she's flying. Slow motion, end over end... We lose all SOUND. Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high -- \nSam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air... Whoomph-! Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette. Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu sarcophagus. Out of sight. \nTHE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood. \nShe stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's something wrong about her *eyes*. \nEn route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, its flesh scorched and torn -- and KILLS it. Puts it away with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes squirming with madness... \nThe car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN. \nA jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat -- With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground. \nThe snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - AKRON, OHIO - TWILIGHT \nElsewhere. Tract housing, late-model cars. MITCH HENESSEY delivers a Christmas gift to his nine year-old son TODD: not just any gift, the *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*, with action figures. Henessey points to the box, engrossed: \nHENESSEY ...and here's the jail here, see...? Escape chute for the Borian, he's a dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't take no shit neither. See, you can make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell, look, I played with it a little myself, I'm sorry. \nVOICE interrupts them: \nVOICE (O.S.) TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW. \nAn awkward pause. Henessey scowls. \nHENESSEY Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you like the present. \nTODD It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she... (sighs) She gets weird. On my birthday, when you gave me the Schwinn... she called bicycle stores to see if there'd been any robberies. \nHenessey manages to control his face. Says tightly: \nHENESSEY Tell her I don't steal them locally. \nHe watches, forlorn, as his son vanishes inside the house. Christmas lights, blinking feebly. We HEAR, supered: \nHENESSEY (V.O.) Dear Ma: Filled out the child support stuff last week. Office got pissed, under ex-spouse I put \"Spawn of Satan, Dweller in Eternal Dark.\" Just being honest, Ma, lady wants me to die. \nAs he reaches his car, his BEEPER goes off. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - MINUTES LATER \nHenessey on the phone. Dials. Waits. We HEAR: \nHENESSEY (V.O.) I'd go without a ripple, that's the truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired. Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth from me for so long. Or maybe you believed in me. I miss you. I hope you believed, even for a day. No one did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your son, Mitch. \nThe phone picks up. He says: \nHENESSEY Me. What's up? \nTRIN (O.S.) Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia chick's photo. Found a guy remembers seeing her, fall of '87. He wants cash, should I grease him? \nHENESSEY Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let the fucker squeeze the Charmin. \nTRIN You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do it, but we're talking time and a half. Plus a night on the town when I get back, and *no cockfights this time*. \nINT. SAMANTHA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER \nSamantha, having survived. Laid up now in an austere hospital room. Listening to silence. Stares out the window at a sunlit tree. Head bandaged. Frowns: \nSAMANTHA I want a cigarette, why do I want a cigarette...? \nOutside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides off the edge of consciousness... \nIN THE DREAM: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring at her reflection -- it's bleeding from a scalp wound. \nShe probes her head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing but the tiny RIDGED SCAR she's had for as long as she can remember. \nSAMANTHA What... what do you want...? \nThe reflection eyes her grimly. Haggard. Tired. \nREFLECTION I want a cigarette. \nSAMANTHA I don't smoke. \nREFLECTION (chuckles) You used to. \n", "test1_id": 2289, "test2_input": "Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes creak open, struggle to focus... Hears WATER running. A shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain. \nEXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT \nHenessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two. \nA photo of Hal and Caitlin. \nHe pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN, swabbing at her hair. \nShe breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: \"one sec.\" Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying him. \nHe cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be... \nNow she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood- red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days. \nThen, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha. \nAmnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she hasn't seen the light of day in eight years. \nCHARLY Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh- oh, you're seeping. \nShe grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says: \nCHARLY Here, look at this. \nWith that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts. Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again. \nHENESSEY Ah, that hurt like shit!! \nCHARLY That's why I distracted you first. (dabs at his wounds) Same principle as breaking in virgins. \nHENESSEY Same as -- virgins, *what*...? \nCHARLY Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in. Distracts from the pain. You ever try that? \nHENESSEY No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell \"pop goes the weasel,\" what the fuck are you talking about? Who are you?? \nCHARLY Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to meet'cha. Drink? \nINT. CASINO BAR - EVENING \nHenessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby table, steals it outright. \nCHARLY See? Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em. \nHenessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says: \nHENESSEY I'm confused. Gimme a minute. \nCHARLY Take two, they're small. \nShe knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts uncomfortably, lights a smoke. \nHENESSEY Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight face. (frowns) So then... Samantha, she... \nCHARLY Never really existed. Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, I made her up. \nHENESSEY Fabrication. And now she's just... gone? Forever and ever? \nCHARLY Thank God. Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me. \nHenessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest. \nHENESSEY Pretty convincing act. \nCHARLY Guess so. \nHENESSEY I mean, her personality, it had to come from *somewhere* -- \nCHARLY Change the subject. Better yet, steal me another drink. \nHenessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He reaches over and lifts their beers. \nHENESSEY Drink up. What's next? \nCHARLY I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring us in from the field alive... \nHENESSEY Chapter. Can you trust them? \nCHARLY Not sure. Until I know, you might wanna stay away from curbs. \nHe looks at her, confused: \nCHARLY They like to push people in front of buses. \nDidn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by: \nSANTA CLAUS (bad Caribbean accent) Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo. *Come this way, everybody*! \n", "test2_true": "CHARLY If I could come that way I wouldn't need to dance the lambada. Follow me, I need you to do something. \nEXT. DANCE CLUB - PAY PHONE - NIGHTTIME \nHenessey hunches forward, speaks rapidly into the phone: \nHENESSEY ...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's lost it and I want fucking out, now *call the Feds*. She's moving us tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the details. \nHe hangs up quickly. Turns -- reveal CHARLY, lounging a foot away, watching him. \nHENESSEY All right, Charly. What did that accomplish? \nCHARLY I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure he's gotta be tapping your office. Got a light...? \nHENESSEY (pause, then:) Oh, no. He just traced that call? \nShe swipes matches from his pocket. Nods. \nCHARLY Come midnight, you hang by the phone. Nobody shows, we think about trusting him. He tries to kidnap and torture you, well, there it is. \nHENESSEY Whoa, time out. \nCHARLY Oh, don't be such a baby. (lights her cigarette) Ten o'clock, we got two hours to kill. I'm a woman, feed me. \nEXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - NIGHTTIME \nCARNIVAL RIDES, dead for the winter. Henessey and Charly stroll beneath them. He smokes. She eats Chinese. \nCHARLY Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a food baby. \nHe takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it. \nHENESSEY \"Charly.\" fucking unbelievable. (beat) Shame about the fat ass. I bet you were really attractive once. \nCHARLY Oh, I was. Check this out. One time? A guy said he'd fuck me. \nHENESSEY No. \nCHARLY Swear to God. \nHENESSEY Did he make good? \nCHARLY Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh my God, afterwards I said the most funny thing, you know what I said...? (beat) I said, \"Go back to your room. Dad...\" \nShe laughs through a swig of beer. MEMORY FLASH: Charly's bedroom as DAD puts the gun to his head and fires, CRACK... \nCHARLY It's why he thought I had him killed. \nHenessey huddles, watching her closely. \nHENESSEY Your father was murdered. \nShe nods, gazes out over the icy waters. Speaks, her voice faraway and gone: \nCHARLY When Da died, I went to his funeral. 12 years old, today I wouldn't. And I overheard a woman, she was praying... She was thanking God -- sounded so happy -- thanking Him it hadn't been *her* father who was killed. See... she didn't really care that God had let someone die... just so long as it missed *her*. (beat) ...and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed. \nAnger flares in her eye. Like a stirring of mud at the bottom of a deep, deep, pond. \nCHARLY Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid. I determine who gets hit, and how hard. And I thank no one. It's pathetic to thank someone who spares you -- when they're just taking someone else. (beat) Walk me upstairs? \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHTTIME \nThey enter the suite. She drops her purse, sways toward him. Presses him against the wall, framed there in the doorway. \nCHARLY This is my first date in eight years, Mitch. Is this a fun date...? \nQuite suddenly, Charly leans over and kisses him on the lips. He reacts, startled. Stares at her. \nHENESSEY Okay, what's going on? \nCHARLY True love, shut the fuck up. \nHENESSEY You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time I got blown candy bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, so what's up? \nCHARLY Chemistry. Be quiet. \nShe nibbles his ear. Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's holding the picture of HAL and CAITLIN. The one he found torn in two. He looks her full in the face: \nHENESSEY Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? I think this is why you'd fuck me. (beat) To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any trace of her. \nHe pushes her away. \nHENESSEY Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. When she comes back, give me a call. \nCharly jerks backward. Angry. Henessey heads for the bathroom. \nHENESSEY Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and she's under the mistaken impression that Mommy gives a shit. \nCharly snatches up her purse, eyes burning: \n", "test2_id": 2290, "test3_input": "HENESSEY Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you? \nCHARLY No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck. \nHenessey draws a sharp breath. Swallows, says: \nHENESSEY Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early. We got fifteen minutes. No more. \nOn her reaction we CUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROADSIDE - WITH TANKER AND EN TOURAGE \nBeside the tanker, A PANEL TRUCK sits, engine idling. Phony logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes. A RAMP is lowered, and a CAR begins backing up into the truckbed, facing outwards. \nINSIDE THE TRUCKBED, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the frost-covered corpse of IMN AL RAHMAN -- and place him behind the wheel. \nMEANWHILE, AT THE BACK OF THE TANKER \nA blue-suit puts a PADLOCK on the utility box as he passes. SNAPS IT SHUT. \nBACK WITH HENESSEY - SAME TIME \nHe hears two flat CRACK-!s on the still air. \nHENESSEY Hello...! Charly...? \nEven over the receiver, her desperation's apparent: \nCHARLY Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, *Goddammit*! \nHenessey rubs his eyes. Takes several deeps breaths, mind turning it over. He looks up. Tired. Haunted. \nHENESSEY All right, I'll go in and get her, you watch my back. \nCHARLY No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons. \nHENESSEY So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for? \nHe stuffs a fresh clip in the gun. Wipes away sweat. \nHENESSEY (to himself) C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right, just this once... please... \nCloses his eyes. Gathers himself. Long pause... \nHENESSEY Piece of cake. \nHe leaps from the roof and makes a death run. \nGun in one hand, radio in the other. Swerving and dodging like a broken-field runner, CHARLY in his ear screaming: \nCHARLY (V.O.) *Your nine, on your nine*! \nHe spins, BLASTS AWAY, dead guy, pitching forward -- SMOKE, billowing, making him COUGH... \nCHARLY (V.O.) *30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*. (beat) *Your other left*. \nStumbling, catching himself. Barreling forward. \nCHARLY (V.O.) *Nix, nix, I can't see in there, don't do it, break right...*! \nHe breaks right. \nCHARLY (V.O.) *Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta threre*! \nHe staggers out of the smoke: TWO MEN, MP-5 machine guns. Trained on his chest. He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two distant CRACKS. The bad men go away, catapulted backwards. Henessey shouts into the radio: \nHENESSEY Gracias. \nCHARLY (V.O.) *De nada*. \nUP ABOVE, ON THE HILL \nCHARLY fires shot after shot. Every time she squeezes the trigger, someone dies. No such thing as wounded, we're talking St. Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's. \nBACK DOWN BELOW \nThe smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker. Right there, thirty yards away. Yellow UTILITY BOX. No one in the way. \nCHARLY (V.O.) *End run, Mitch, go wide*! \nHe breaks for the truck. \nCHARLY (V.O.) *No, Goddamn you, they got you flanked...*! \nEverybody fires a gun. \nMITCH GETS HIT \nTakes one high in the chest, SPINS him...! \n", "test3_true": "CHARLY SPRAYS on full auto, DICES TO TATTERS the combat zone, extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because \nMITCH IS IN DEEP \nBAM--! bullet takes out his right arm, fuck *you*, buddy, doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other hand and KEEPS SHOOTING, blows that fucker down and now he's staggering into the trees, and collapses, and HITS... And lies very still and bleeds. As ECHOES of gunfire die slowly, we HEAR: \nHENESSEY (V.O.) Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants, they're pretty great. Some really funny ants here, Ma. All these funny ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em awhile... \nUP ON THE HILL \nAftermath... Charly's out of ammo. Flings aside the rifle, snarling in a helpless rage -- Something else, then. SOUND, nearby. Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo -- \nA SCREAMING CHOPPER RISES BEHIND HER. \nCrests the cliff and hovers like the SWORD OF DAMOCLES. \nINT. CHOPPER - SAME TIME \nMARKSMAN, riding shotgun. Scans the cliff below: Thick evergreens. Charly, somewhere among them. He sights down his rifle, takes careful aim -- BLOWS OUT TIRES on the Jaguar. Cripples it. The chopper BANKS, heading away. \nBACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME \nIn big trouble. MANY HEADLIGHTS, bouncing uphill toward her. Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't much better: A 200 FOOT DROP. Straight down. Evergreen trees, far below. Power lines. Highway. \nShe hears the PHONE RINGING, then... inside the Jag. Crosses slowly. Reaches in, lifts the receiver. It's TIMOTHY. \nTIMOTHY (V.O.) I tried to give you a pretty death, baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked, now it's ground beef time. \nCHARLY The truck. How long til it blows? \nTIMOTHY (incredulous) Sweet Loretta, you're another animal entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees... Make it ten minutes, give or take. \nCHARLY Then I better hurry. \nTIMOTHY Oh, spare me. You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in what's left of your face. \nHe clicks off. Charly drops the receiver. Turns, looks behind: They're coming for her. \nWoods filled with headlights. Backlit FIGURES. Ducking in and out of the trees, getting closer... The wind blows. Bitter cold out here in the dark night of the soul. Nothing left. No hope. No reason. \nCaitlin, dead. \nThe rage explodes in the form of a kick which SHATTERS the lock on the trunk. *Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle. \nAt that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, CREAKING... Revealing all of Timothy's BUNJEE JUMPING EQUIPMENT. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SAME TIME \nThe TANKER is rolling. Out onto the road, snorting and belching. Preceded by the Little Debbie PANEL TRUCK. \nINT. UTILITY BOX - ON TANKER - SAME TIME \nPoor little Caitlin huddles in the dark. All alone. ROARING in her ears. Sort of like being underwater. \nEXT. TANKER TRUCK - CLOSE ON UNDERBELLY \nA silver device attached to the skin of the tank. \nWITH TIMOTHY - CROSSING THE SMOKE-FILLED GROUNDS \nHe consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch. Red numerals. *178 degrees*. \nEXT. CLIFF'S EDGE - WITH CHARLY \nShe won't quit. Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of C-4 EXPLOSIVE to the bottom of the Jaguar. Straightens. Turns around -- \nStands dead calm as they all come out of the TREES, guns drawn... Raises her hands, see, boys...? No bang-bang. \nLike backlit monsters, they approach, hulking. Matter of yards, now... She flashes a naughty little smile -- \nGoes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward. \n200 feet of open air, THE BUNJEE Cord pays out, fast...! Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to the STEERING COLUMN and meanwhile \nTHE CHAPTER AGENTS \nRush forward, incredulous. Peer OVER THE EDGE: Below them, a swan diver, BLACKNESS all around. She drops like a stone. Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem. \nINSIDE THE JAGUAR: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to stretch outward. DECELERATION kicking in, Charly can FEEL it, still whistling through space... \nHits a dead stop. \nThis is it. Cord, stretched as far as it goes. \nShe's still sixty feet above the highway. \nNo hesitation whatsoever. She thumbs the DETONATOR in her right fist -- \nBlows the car. \n", "test3_id": 2291}

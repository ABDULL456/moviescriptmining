{"test1_input": "\"THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT\" \nby \nShane Black \nREVISED DRAFT \nFebruary 24, 1995 \nA WINDOWPANE \nAssaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed. \nINSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS... Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR, as a soft voice says: \nVOICE Shhhhh. \nAnd there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling eye. \nLITTLE GIRL Mommy, the men on the mountain...! \nMOM Shhhh. Gone, all gone now. (strokes her hair) I'm here. Mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you. Safe now... safe and warm... snug as a bug in a rug. (beat) I'll sit with you, think you can sleep? \nLITTLE GIRL Turn on the nightlight. \nThe mother nods. Passes her left hand gently over the girl's forehead. \nMOM Close your eyes now. I love you. \nThe child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT -- \nHer entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun. \nShe staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed. The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the glass. \nFADE OUT. Pause. Blackness. \nFADE IN: \nIt's snowing in southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled in the rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia. SUPER the legend: \nUPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO. Three Weeks Earlier. \nPeaceful. Serene. It's the town in the glass bubble, the one God shakes to watch it snow... \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nCHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from loudspeakers. \nHAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his \"Ho's\" in groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off. \nBeside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things: First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman. For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE. \nSAMANTHA How you holdin' up? \nEARL Freezing my nuts off. \nSanta produces a bottle of Seagrams. Starts to open it. \nSAMANTHA *Put that away*. \nEarl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl from a street corner: \nBURNOUT Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT! \nSamantha squirms in her seat, scowling. \nSAMANTHA I can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving me crazy, but there's these *kids* here -- \nEARL Right, you don't wanna be rootin' -- \nSAMANTHA In front of little Billy, age four, yeah. \"Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses to go butt-mining.\" \nEARL This is little Billy talking? \nSAMANTHA Age four, kid's unbelievable. (sighs) I'm too old for this, Earl. \nEARL Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate the size of a melon. \nSamantha stares at him. \nEARL Seriously, half my life's a doctor's hand up my ass, I should marry the fucker. \nSAMANTHA Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it. \nEARL It's not that fucking little Billy again, is it? \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \n", "test1_true": "SAMANTHA (V.O.) Eight years. I keep hiring detectives, but they never find anything. (beat) I was born 3000 days ago on the beach in New Jersey. I entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes I don't remember buying. Nothing in the pockets but a single key, filed smooth. (beat) I'm married now. Nice guy, early forties. I stand naked in the mirror and try to guess my age. Thirty-five, maybe. I have lots of scars. \nEXT. SNOWY SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON \nSamantha walks with her husband HAL. Late thirties. Balding. Coming out of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. \nSAMANTHA Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the Christmas pageants I've seen, this was by far the most recent. \nHAL Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing the wise men, what'd you expect? \nSAMANTHA Teenage boys? \nHAL Well, I thought they did fine. \nSAMANTHA Just fine? Come on, it was ground breaking stuff. The first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night. \nShe hugs him good-naturedly. As they near their house, an eight year-old GIRL drops from a TREEHOUSE and comes running, leaps into Mommy's arms -- \nSAMANTHA Hey, you! \nThe kid leaps into her arms, as we HEAR: \nSAMANTHA (V.O.) Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter and when I woke up on that long-ago day, she was two months grown in my belly. I don't know who put her there. I may never. I just know she's mine, and she's about to turn eight. \nThe family troops up the driveway to their SUBURBAN HOME. Chipper little A-frame. Christmas lights abound. Behind the house, a vast frozen POND. It is idyllic. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT \nPARTY in progress. Laughter. Mingling. In the corner, CAITLIN puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil. Samantha shepherds her home room class past the punchbowl. She is radiant. EARL surreptitiously nips from a silver flask. \nSAMANTHA (V.O.) 3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade. I have the key, I wear it around my neck for luck. Except for that, and my name, all traces of my prior life are lost. (beat) Was I in love ever...? Did someone look in my eyes, did I say, \"Darling, I'll never forget you...?\" (beat) Because fuck me, darling, I managed. \nACROSS THE ROOM -- Her daughter CAITLIN hangs with two young girls. Shows off a plush TEDDY BEAR, says: \nCAITLIN His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named him for me. \nGIRL #1 points, whispers excitedly: \nGIRL #1 That's her? \nCaitlin nods. Kid #2: \nGIRL #2 That's who? \nGIRL #1 (excitedly) Her Mom, she's got amnesia. \nGIRL #2 Swear? \nCAITLIN Swear. \nGIRL #2 Too weird. \nA voice interrupts their reverie: \nSAMANTHA Excuse me. \nThe girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha is leaning on the desk behind them. Busted. She smiles amiably: \nSAMANTHA Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to help Dad with the refreshments. (leans in, whispers) Which one's Dad? I forget. \nThe girls look at her like she's grown a tail. \nSAMANTHA *Kidding*. \nCUT TO: \nA DOOR KICKED OPEN, WHAM-! Splintered. Lock shattered. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - AKRON, OHIO - NIGHT \nA NUDE COUPLE on the bed. They look up, startled -- as three men burst through the door. The LEADER: a haggard-looking man sporting a soup-stain on his tie, whoops, that's the design, sorry. MITCH HENESSEY, private investigator and con man extraordinaire. He flashes a phony badge: \nYOUNG MAN POLICE. DON'T MOVE. \nMAN ON BED What the hell is this...?!! \nYOUNG MAN Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're assuming I won't shoot your sorry ass, and everyone knows when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff, I will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest is too violent, then I will personally HIRE men to ass-fuck you for ten years. So if you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead and mouth off, but meanwhile you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution, now shut the fuck up before I cut out your kneecaps and use 'em as ashtrays. (beat) Officer Donleavy, read him his rights. \nDonleavy looks pale, pasty. He stutters a few words. Loses interest. Wanders away across the room. \nMAN ON BED (a trifle confused) Please, this is my first, I... I've never done this before, I'll do anything...! \nYOUNG MAN Sir, listen to me. I understand you're not a wealthy man, but in light of the damage this arrest will cause you, we might be able to make an arrangement -- \nDonleavy plops in a chair. Belches. Grins foolishly. The man in bed points to him: \nMAN IN BED Is he all right...? \nTHE REMAINING COP is swaying on his feet. Like a tree in a hurricane. Donleavy pukes all over the floor. We CUT TO: \n", "test1_id": 2289, "test2_input": "Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody reflection takes a long, satisfying drag. \nREFLECTION Relax, you can drop the act. Nice and smooth, take another hit. There you go. See how easy it comes back? \nThey are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily. \nREFLECTION *I'm* coming back. You know that, don't you? Name's Charly, by the way. You're gonna love me. \nThe reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH. \nINT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY \nBack at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind. \nHAL Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong about this. \nSAMANTHA I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I know it. \nCAITLIN Daddy, make her stop! \nSAMANTHA Hush. Go to the garage and get me something, anything. A veggie, go, man, go! I'm hot to trot. \nINT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME \nHal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door. \nHAL Tomato. \nCaitlin turns, tosses it to Sam -- \nCAITLIN Tomato. \nWho catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur. Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a mad mumblety-pegger -- \nHAL Onion, flying in. \nSam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up. \nSAMANTHA More. Faster. \nAnd it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another, she giggles, starts throwing them overhand -- \nCAITLIN Tomato. Tomato. Tomato. \nAnd now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up Caitlin -- \nSamantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think: Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance. Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to the wall, KA-CHUK--! \nEveryone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks. \nSAMANTHA Uh... chefs do that. \nINT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL \nUnderground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces hum and tick in the sweaty gloom. \nA SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him, what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in the eye as the guy blubbers: \nMAN Please, man... I don't know why you gotta kill me... But use the gun, not the knife. Please. As a fucking favor, I'm begging you... \nTIMOTHY It'll be over soon. \nMAN Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the knife... Shit, I can't handle getting shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...! \nTIMOTHY Last chance. What do you know about a town called Santa Claus? \nMAN What is this, *what the fuck is this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you can't do this to me. I don't know ANYTHING. \nTimothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied. \nTIMOTHY No. You don't. (beat) I can always tell, you know... If someone's lying to me. A little skill of mine, something to trot out at parties. \nHe slams home the knife. We don't see it, but we FEEL the impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches away from Timothy, their eyes lock... \nA CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it from his belt and flips it open: \nTIMOTHY Timothy. \nVOICE (O.S.) Message from Mr. Daedalus. \nTIMOTHY I'm listening. \nHe shrugs at his captive. Rolls his eyes. The guy's still dying, still on the KNIFE. \nVOICE (O.S.) He says he's sorry, but he needs you right away. Something's come up. \nTIMOTHY Nix. I'm just finishing up here. Then I'm going bunjee jumping. \nVOICE (O.S.) He's aware of your weekend plans, and he apologizes. \n", "test2_true": "VOICE (O.S.) Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack...? Recently escaped from a high-security prison, as you're aware. But listen to this: prior to his escape, seems he saw something on TV that disturbed him. So much he had to be sedated. \nTIMOTHY I saw it, too. It's called \"Empty Nest.\" How the fuck is it my business? \nVOICE (O.S.) The man was overheard talking to himself under sedation. (beat) He said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir. \nTimothy is silent. \nSUIT I know it's incredible, sir, but... if she were alive, I'm thinking she might be in contact with the old man in Pennsylvania. Should I -- \nTIMOTHY Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus I'm on my way. Timothy out. \nHe clicks off, face troubled. Withdraws the knife. Checks his clothing. Not one speck of blood. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - CHECKOUT STAND - AFTERNOON \nA CARTON OF MARLBORO REDS hits the stack of groceries. HAL looks at his wife, bewildered. \nSAMANTHA They were on sale. \nAt the next register over, a duo of Canadians throw looks her way. Confer in rapid-fire French, subtitled for us: \nCANADIAN #1 Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. (Subtitle: I'd like to fuck her.) \nThe checker looks up, smiles: \nCHECKER Don't you love hearing people speak French? \nCANADIAN #2 Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une femme c'est comme Gumby avec des seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her over a chair, women are merely Gumbys with tits.) \nHAL Beautiful language. \nHe turns to Samantha -- except Sam isn't there. Her arm shoots out-! CLAMPS on one of the men. By the throat. Catches him like a fucking VICE. Her voice a sibilant hiss: \nSAMANTHA *Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils de pute*. \nSubtitle: \"Gumby's gonna stretch your neck, motherfucker.\" Accent flawless. Eyes like steel. The man will go on to start a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits. \nSLAM CUT TO: \nSAMANTHA - ON THE PHONE TO HER SHRINK - INTERCUT \nJubilant, can't contain herself: \nSAMANTHA I speak French. \nPSYCHIATRIST You do. \nSAMANTHA You bet your life, fluent French, whatever the fuck that means. (chortles) Quand j'\u00e9tais a l'ecole, Jai eu un professeur qui s'est fabriqu\u00e9 du dentifrice! \nPSYCHIATRIST You just said when you were in school, your teacher was made of toothpaste. \nSAMANTHA Right, he was, you got a problem with that? Pasty Joe, we called him. Look, the accent's perfect, so piss off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nSamantha and daughter CAITLIN sing a hearty chorus of \"Frere Jaques.\" Sam giggles , Caitlin looks nervous; astride her new two-wheeler BICYCLE while Sam finishes removing the training wheels. Caitlin points to her stuffed TEDDY BEAR. \nCAITLIN Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck. \nSAMANTHA Mr. Perkins, going in the basket. \nCAITLIN Are the training wheels off? \nSAMANTHA Just pretend they're still there. Piece of cake. You can do it. \nCAITLIN Wait...! I'm scared. \nSAMANTHA Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend you're one of the X-men, you're tough. Let's go, now. Three, two, one... \nCAITLIN Mom, I can't do it, swear -- \nSamantha sets her sailing. Laughs excitedly. The bike weaves, side to side... hits the curb and topples with a CRASH. Spills Caitlin to the pavement. Now's she's CRYING. \nCAITLIN Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-! \nSamantha walks over briskly. Face set in determined lines. \nSAMANTHA Nonsense. You can do it. You don't want to, but you can. \nCAITLIN My arm hurts, please take me home...! \nSAMANTHA You can go home, Caitlin. You can ride there. \nAn unpleasant note is edging into her voice. The louder the kid cries, the more Samantha starts to SIMMER. \nCAITLIN Mom, no...! \nSAMANTHA Look, I know you're afraid, that's the whole *point*, can you see that? Now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike. \n", "test2_id": 2290, "test3_input": "CHARLY I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY ASKED ME. \nShe storms out. CUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME \nCharly stalks the city streets. A quartet sings, \"God Rest Ye Merry,\" ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total misfit. Searches her own haggard features in a shop window. Swallows hard, whispers: \nCHARLY Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, no way. Bitch is dead. \nShe bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets. That's when a tall BEARDED MAN crosses the street and falls in alongside. \nBEARDED MAN Good evening. \nCHARLY Fuck off. \nBEARDED MAN I see me a good-looking lady, all upset, I wonder if she doesn't need some male company. \nCHARLY Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I get raped. \nHis hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38. \nBEARDED MAN Step into the alley, honey. I ain't asking, I'm telling. \nCharly stops walking. Regards him the way you or I might look at a telephone cord. Groans: \nCHARLY Oh, don't tell me. You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. Go away and come back at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got a light? \nThe guy stares, mouth working. \nBEARDED MAN Lady, I have a gun! \nWhich is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson COCKS next to his ear: \nVOICE (V.O.) This ain't no ham on rye, pal. \nHENESSEY holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. Charly spins on him, eyes flashing: \nCHARLY What the hell are you doing here? \nHENESSEY Saving your life. Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line. \nCHARLY You think I couldn't take him? *Idiot*, you probably scared the other guy away -- \nHENESSEY What other guy -- ? \nCHARLY Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons? \nHENESSEY I TOOK LESSONS. \nThe hitman watches, bewildered. Considers waving to get their attention. Finally he can't stand it. Blurts out: \nBEARDED MAN Hey! \nCharly snaps her head toward him: \nCHARLY *What*? \nBEARDED MAN I still got this fucking gun! \nShe smiles sweetly. \nCHARLY No, you don't. \nTakes it off him. Just like that. He stares dumbly at his empty hand. Half of his trigger finger is missing. \nBEARDED MAN SHIIIIT!! \nCharly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK. Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards. \nCompletes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES. Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside -- \nBEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE meant for Henessey arcs through the air... \nImbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead. Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking. \nCHARLY Fuck you. Just fuck all of you. \nEXT. ATLANTIC CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME \nA BRONCO ROARS UP out of a parking garage. Swerves and plunges into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most popular board game. \nINT. BRONCO - SAME \nCharly drives, possessed. Henessey drinks. Hands shaking. \nCHARLY Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that prick. \nShe throws a shrieking skid. Henessey clutches for the dashboard, swearing. \n", "test3_true": "HENESSEY Don't be so sure, others have tried. The entire population, in fact. (beat) Look, about me...? I mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, I'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore. \nCharly reaches over. Yanks the doorhandle. \nCHARLY Good point. \nShe kicks him out of the moving car. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME \nHe bounces off the highway. Rolls. Over and over, shudders to a stop. Pause... The wind blows. He groans. Looks up, spits gravel. Stands. Dusts himself off. Watches the Bronco go far away. \nTIME CUT - EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nAs Henessey trudges wearily down the highway we HEAR: \nHENESSEY (V.O.) Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams just threw me out of a speeding car. Now more people will come an shoot me in the head. On the plus side, I won two bucks at video poker. \nA SCREECH of tires, he turns, startled -- here comes the Bronco. Skids onto the highway and races back toward him. Pulls up alongside. CHARLY throws open the door, says: \nCHARLY Get in. \nHe does. Without a word. Closes the door, they drive off. He lights a cigarette like nothing happened. Shakes out the match, speaks without looking at her: \nHENESSEY Found a use for me. \nCHARLY Yep. (beat) I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money, a whole bunch. \nHENESSEY Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second while I pull it out of my ass. \nShe turns to him, a gleam in her eye. Speaks softly: \nCHARLY The key, Mitch. The one I keep around my neck. \nHENESSEY What about it? \nCHARLY What if I told you it's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International Airport? \nHENESSEY How would you know? Someone filed off the numbers. \nCHARLY Not someone. Me. I filed them off. (beat) There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch. \nHENESSEY What's in it? \nCHARLY \nHenessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey. \nCHARLY Payment for my last assignment. I need you to retrieve it for me. \nHENESSEY Why me? \nCHARLY Don't be stupid, they might have the place covered. I don't want to get shot to pieces. \nHENESSEY Shoulda known. (sighs) Gimme the key. \nCHARLY I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin back in Ohio. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nThe BRONCO races on into the night... \nINT. BRONCO - SAME TIME \nLate, very late now. Henessey, driving. Beside him, Charly reclines, lost in reverie. Features bathed in passing roadlights. Henessey grinds out a butt: \nHENESSEY Humor me: you're a paid assassin, then you fall off a cliff. Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened? \nCHARLY I fell into a school of fish, they elected me principal. Shut the fuck up. \nHENESSEY Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of that...? \nCHARLY Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope, seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, Christ almighty. What are you, my shrink? \nHENESSEY No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it. I been there, you know. I'd kill for fucking amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I can think is I got reamed in the ass by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, here's a ball glove, did you know Daddy screamed when they carved the name in his back...? Mary, by the way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell. God, I'm tired. (beat) I never did one thing right, you know it, not one fucking thing. Not even accidental, that takes skill. \nHe looks over. She's asleep, hasn't heard a word. Face slack, lips slightly parted. The toughness banished from her features. In its place, a lingering sadness. CUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN BREAKING \nThe Bronco glides along. Charly in the passenger seat, eyes roving like a hawk's. THE CAINE HOUSE is peaceful and quiet. Christmas lights, still burning dimly. \nCHARLY Drive past, don't slow down. (points) Park under those trees, honk if there's trouble. \nHENESSEY (bad Rochester) Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw down fo' you. \nShe stuffs a .45 automatic in her waistband. Cradles an MP-5 beneath her coat. Rolls out of the still-moving truck. Makes her way through back yards. Silent as a cat. She went to cookouts here. Bridge parties. Now she prowls, a grim assassin. \nLeaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face with RAYMOND, a fifth grade student we saw earlier. Secreted behind the woodpile, SMOKING. His eyes pop as he spies good ol' Ms. Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon. Charly doesn't miss a beat: \n", "test3_id": 2291}

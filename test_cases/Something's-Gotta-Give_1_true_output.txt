ARRY 
You don't want pancakes anymore? 
ERICA 
I, uh, I don't think I...I... (looks at Marin so) gorgeous, next to him No. I don't. 
Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how perfect it is. 
INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY 
Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket. Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking cherries. 
MARIN 
I'm breaking up with Harry. 
ERICA 
Why? What do you mean? 
MARIN 
'Cause I met someone else. 
ERICA 
In the two days you've been gone? 
MARIN 
You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a thousand people everyday. Also, let's face it, the guy's insanely old for me. I'd be nuts to keep this going. 
ERICA 
True, but you know he is.... 
MARIN 
-- I know. He's soulful when you don't expect it, right? 
ERICA 
It's unnerving. 
MARIN 
Now, Mom, if you could handle this, I was thinking... you and Harry... 
ERICA 
I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to handle it. 
MARIN 
But you're only saying that 'cause you think he and I have had sex. 
ERICA 
Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you? 
MARIN 
(whispering) Never even got close. Swear to God. (Erica digests this) Just puttin' that out there...'cause for two people who are convinced they got life beat, there's was somethin' cooking in the kitchen last night other than pancakes. 
INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN 
Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for it and slips right Out Of Frame. 
ERICA (O.S.) 
(into phone) Hello. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the 
J 
ER, on his CELL PHONE. 
ULIAN 
I've waited a reasonable amount of hours before calling you, even though you've been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15. I'm wondering when we could have dinner again? I have to work the next few nights and if we wait 'til next week, I know you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I know it's like a date night but I think that's good. 
ERICA 
Who is this? Julian stops short. 
ERICA 
I'm kidding! 
JULIAN 
Can you meet me at The Grill at eight? 
ERICA 
Okay. Yes. That's seems fine. 
I 
JULIAN 
I look forward to, seeing you too. Erica smiles to herself. 
ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL 
turning off the phone and grabbing his heart 
NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN 
Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a little dazed. 
MARIN 
Okay, he's all yours. 
ERICA 
Stop that. How'd he take it? 
MARIN 
He just took care of it for me; He was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate was to be friends. ...Oh my God. (realizes something) He was breaking up with me. He's a genius. 
ERICA 
That's impossible, he wouldn't... 
MARIN 
It doesn't matter, we're done and we both feel good about it. (hugs her) I gotta get back. (as she exits) Now Erica, try to think of this as the smartest thing you've ever done for yourself. Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

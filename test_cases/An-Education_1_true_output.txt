TINA Oh my God! I've only just realised! That's what's going to happen to you, isn't it? Look at her! Men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper! 
HATTIE God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't thought of that. Look at her. 
JENNY Don't be so daft. 
TINA We're trying to attract the attention of boys. 
And she's fighting off men. Anyway. You're going to have to tell us more than that. 
JENNY Why? 
HATTIE Because no man's ever   going to ask us out to supper.   Not until we're ladies, anyway.   You're going to have to tell   us everything. Otherwise   it's not fair. 
JENNY There won't be anything to tell. 
TINA Well, make something up, then. 
15   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                  15 
Jenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good, but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing in front of her, shouting. 
JACK I won't allow it! 
JENNY (coolly) Fine. He's quite happy for you to take me. 
JACK (uncertainly) Right. I will. 
JENNY Good. 
JACK Where is it? 
JENNY St John's Smith Square. 
JACK Where's that? 
JENNY I don't know. I'm sure we could find out. 
Marjorie comes into the room. 
MARJORIE It's in Westminster. Just around the corner from the Abbey. 
Jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the nearest opium den. 
JACK How d'you know that? 
MARJORIE I had a life before we were married, you know. 
JENNY He soon put a stop to that. 
JACK There we are. 
JENNY Where are we? 
JACK Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not going all the way over there. 
JENNY The trouble is, that's where St John's Smith Square is. 
JACK And I've just said. That's where I'm not going. There must be something on locally. Where's the paper? 
MARJORIE Jack, she wants to see someone who can play. She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland scratching away. I'll take her. 
JACK And how are you going to get over there? RAF helicopter? 
The doorbell rings. 
JENNY That's him. Now what? 
JACK Oh, bloody hell. 
MARJORIE Jack! 
Jenny starts towards the door, and then turns. 
JENNY Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself. 
She   goes to the door. 
JACK (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews!

-- and can pick up sports talk radio in their cortical block if they get too close to a Con-Ed transformer. 
MARCO 
-- Delp.   It's not GWS. Delp has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him seriously. 
DELP 
A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood-type, DNA. Pentagon ordered up half a million, and stuck about five thousand experimentally into high-risk soldiers and infantry. But the scanners proved skittish and field hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal got eighty-sixed and forgotten. 
MARCO 
The Army never put one in me. 
DELP 
That you know of, man.     That you know of. (then) How'd you find me? 
MARCO (V.O.) 
I looked under Mad Scientists in the yellow pages -- there was a full page ad. 
DELP 
Ha ha. Marco stares down into a big pit. Among the racks of equipment are two primate-sized stainless-steel beds with restraints and I.V. trees waiting. 
DELP 
You seriously believe somebody's messed with your mother board. 
MARCO 
What are you studying here, Delp? 
DELP 
Fear. 
MARCO 
For the Agency? 
DELP 
Nah, CIA cut me loose in '97 during the Macedonian debacle. Now I got this little grant from Wal-Mart. 
Wal-Mart? Fear? Marco looks at the monkeys. Doesn't want to know any more. He shifts his gaze back to Delp. Studies him. Then: 
MARCO 
Look, Delp. My experiences during the war, in Kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me. And my dreams? About what happened? Feel as real as you and me, here, right now. Delp just waits. 
MARCO 
It's like ... I feel like somewhere along the line, I've been ... brainwashed. Or something. You know? All scrambled up. 
DELP 
We've all been brainwashed, Marco. Religion, advertising, television. Politics. We accept what's normal because we're told it's normal and we crave normalcy. Hell, look at the Germans under Hitler. Disco, in the seventies. (beat) And if you're really worried about somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things -- it's horseshit, man. Turns out Pavlov had it right from the getgo. Dogs and all. A little ECT and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price. Ask the Uzbeks. And you would remember it. 
MARCO 
What about my dreams? 
DELP 
(shrugs) What if all this is the fucking dream and you're still back in Kuwait? 
MARCO 
You're not helping me. 
DELP 
I am. You're not helping yourself. Reality is consensual, man. You just gotta prove it up. Or play it out.

Same. Raymond, his handlers, his Secret Service escort walk a gauntlet of news cameras, REPORTERS lob questions from behind a barrier: 
REPORTER #2 
Congressman Shaw! Why do you and Gov. Arthur oppose deploying troops in Indonesia? 
RAYMOND 
We can't clean up the world with dirty hands.

What about your mother's        Is your mother helping or allegation that a nuclear       hurting your campaign? attack on this country from a secret alliance of rogue states is certain within two years? 
RAYMOND 
Guys, I gave up a long time ago trying to second guess my mother. I'm just surprised the rest of you haven't. 
MARCO 
Do you ever dream about Kuwait? Heads turning to find Marco, folder under his arm -- strange looks -- Secret Service poised to react, but Raymond slows, looks -- sees Marco. A cloud passing over his features: 
RAYMOND 
I can never remember my dreams. MORE QUESTIONS lobbed out, overlapping, but Raymond ignores them. Marco pushes through as Raymond assures Anderson:

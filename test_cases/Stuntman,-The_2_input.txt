ELI Looks like a nice clean-cut kid. 
JAKE I know about fifty guys who don't think so. 
ELI What'd he do? 
JAKE (to Production Manager, ignoring Eli's question) The minute that film gets here you give me a call. 
CAMERON (yawning and rising) I don't know about those fifty guys, but I know one weary guy who's gonna crawl upstairs and hit the sack. 
Eli looks at Cameron with grudging admiration. 
GABE I know a weary guy who's driving to Cape Long to dance and booze all night... 
RAYMOND 
(camping, takes Gabe's hand) I know a weary gay who's going with him! 
They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of Raymond's strictly masculine looks). Eli shouts after them. 
ELI So long as you're back in ninety minutes. It's a work night for some of us. (loftily) ...Those who give a shit. 
Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her shoulders -- Cameron watching silently. Then, charging from across the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed MATRON. 
MATRON Miss Franklin! Miss Franklin! Your 'Feminique Spray' commercial is on TV. My God, it's simply heavenly! 73   INT.   CAMERON'S HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT 
Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his few belongings into his pockets. 
WIDER ANGLE 
It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty. He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door. Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly exits. 
74    EXT.   HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT 
As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company STATION WAGON pulls to a stop in the driveway. Nina, Raymond and a few others emerge from the car. Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance. 
DENISE Bet they're looking for that nut who killed all those campers in Montana... 
RAYMOND (drunk) ...Too many campers, weed 'em out! ...Imagine, sitting an hour at a roadblock. 
NINA We should have waited, it wouldn't have been an hour. 74A   They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina. 75    CAMERON'S POV 
Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about her face -- a hauntingly romantic image. 76    ANGLE ON CAMERON 
He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk. There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen if... 
NINA'S VOICE What next? Do you rescue the maiden from the tower? 
She has come up behind him, unnoticed.    He turns, startled, and there she stands. 
CAMERON (smiles) Hi. 
For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then she glances at the tower. 
NINA Yes. It does look pretty high. (with concern) Are you worried about tomorrow? 
Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds sincere. 
CAMERON Not much. I guess if there were any real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do it, would he? 
NINA (quickly, reassuring) No. I'm sure it's safe. 
CAMERON (abruptly, with a boyish grin) Good. Then you jump. 
NINA (laughing) Okay. 
She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge. 
CAMERON Well, come on. 
NINA (willing, but flustered) What, right now? 
For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully. 
NINA (CONT'D) Wait, I'm afraid of heights!   What if I freeze up? 
CAMERON (pulling her along) Don't worry, I'll give you a push. Isn't that what a pal's for? 77   INT.   BELL TOWER - NIGHT 
It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine fright. 
NINA (gasps) Oh, my God! It's terrifying! You can't jump from this...you'll get killed! It's crazy!...

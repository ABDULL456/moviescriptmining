A DEAD \nTHING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL. Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They \nroll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip. \nAt the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle. Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses. \nCholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand.

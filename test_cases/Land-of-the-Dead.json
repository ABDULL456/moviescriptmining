THE SOUND OF CHANNELS BEING TURNED ON A TV. TITLE UP: \n\"SOME TIME AGO\". \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nIt's hard for us here to believe what we're reporting to you, but it does seem to be a fact. CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS. On it, in BLACK & WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nBodies of the recently dead are returning to life and attacking the living. CLICK! With each CLICK, the TV disappears, then reappears in a new position ON SCREEN. CREDITS ROLL in the surrounding \nBLACK. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nMurder victims have shown signs of having been partially devoured by their murderers. CLICK! ANOTHER NEWSCASTER is on the TV now, sitting in a more modern studio. The broadcast remains in BLACK & WHITE. \nSECOND NEWSCASTER \nBecause of the obvious threat to \nuntold numbers of citizens, due to the crisis that is now developing this radio station will \nremain on the air day and night. \nCLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled. \nSECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nIt has been established that persons who have recently died have been returning to life and eating the flesh of the living. \nCLICK! \nSECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nWe must not be lulled by the concept that these are our family members or our friends. They are not. They must be destroyed on sight. CLICK! A THIRD NEWSCASTER, more haggard than the others, sits at an ANCHOR DESK on a barren set, still in BLACK & WHITE. \nTHIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nEvery dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills. The people it kills get up and kill. They kill for one reason. They kill for food. \nCLICK! \nTHIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) \nIf this situation is allowed to continue, there will be nothing left. Nothing. \nCLICK! \nTHIRD NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) \nIt's over. Finished. Finished. It's their world now. \nCLICK! IN ABSOLUTE BLACK, A SINGLE WORD FADES UP: \"TODAY\". A \nSOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft. Metallic. It makes us nervous. \nEXT. UNIONTOWN - NIGHT \nIN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES, SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the \"BEST EATS IN TOWN\". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit. Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues. \nSome of the PEDESTRIANS drift into \"UNIONTOWN PARK\", milling around a GAZEBO, where THREE \"MUSICIANS\" are struggling with a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player, who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK. A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The \"MUSICIANS\" are DEAD. So are the \"PEDESTRIANS\". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO. \nMIKE (O.S.) \nThey're trying to be us. \nRILEY (O.S.) \nThey used to be us. \nA \nN \nEXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT \nRILEY \n(Worried) They're learning how to be us again. RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough exterior. MIKE CONVERSE, 21, young and unseasoned, has the eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned. \nMIKE \nRiley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes, recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose intellect is as burned as his face. \nCHARLIE \nTcha doin', Riley? \nRILEY \nHavin' a bad dream. \nCHARLIE \nI have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just look at me, you can tell that I have terrible dreams. \nRILEY \nThe town is full of walkers. \nCHARLIE \nEvery town is full of walkers. \nRILEY \nThese aren't just walking. They're like...regular folks. \nCHARLIE \nBut they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead folks is near as dumb as me! \nRILEY \nYou learned how to make yourself useful. That's what they're doing. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \nThey dumped the trash. Cholo's on his way. \nRiley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the \nvoice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black \nleather jacket with \"PRETTY BOY\" emblazoned across the back. \nMIKE \n(Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame? \nRILEY \nThis one is. Last one was a guy. \nMIKE \nWhat happened to him? Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket. \nPRETTY BOY \nI kept his jacket. For good luck. \nMIKE \nLuck? \nRILEY \nPut some flowers in the graveyard. Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be felt as much as heard as... \nI \ny \nC \nC \nEXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \n...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions, piercing the night. THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky. \nCHARLIE \n(Looking up) `Flowers in the graveyard'. Why do you call `em that, Riley? I don't get it. These here flowers ain't the kind you lay down on the ground. These here are sky flowers. Way up in Heaven. \nR \nILEY \nI love ya, Charlie. Know why? Cuzz you still believe in heaven. \nTHE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning. \nCHOLO jumps out with the THREE GUERILLAS from the dump. \nHOLO \nYou guys scope out the town? \nRILEY \niley, stunned, lets the corpse slide to the floor. He looks into the rookie's open eyes, devastated. \nB \nEXT. MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT \nTHE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing... ...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down to the ground by... ...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as... ...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red, greenish-black. The blood of the dead. \nT \nhere's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street. \nThe HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds. ig Daddy drops the head, looking down at its befuddled eyes with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL. \nThe convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy \nsees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag. \nBig Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and pulls the trigger. BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward... ...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go. \nREVERSE ANGLE: \nWith the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking. NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE. None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that seems to matter is that they have a leader. \nEXT. DEPOT - PRE-DAWN \nDEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward... ...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN that reads \"SUBWAY (TO CITY)\". In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill. RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men. \nRILEY \nHarry. Beer? \nHarry doesn't answer. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nHarry? Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast! Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into \nthe Harry-Thing's forehead. Its body drops to the ground. \nPRETTY BOY \nGot knocked off his bike in town. Must have been bit. Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN \nA mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which A DERELICT TRAIN is parked. A CARGO CARRIER pulls out, driving along the platform, its flatbed piled with supplies, while ANOTHER CARRIER is being loaded with boxes of food, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and... \nTWO BODY BAGS. \nCHARLIE \nShit happens, Riley. \nRILEY \n(Blaming himself) Only if you let it. \nT \nThe cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off. Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride on the open flatbed with the cargo. The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly... ...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS. Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve. \nMOUSE \nI hate going under the fuckin' river. \nHe takes out a joint. Lights up. The match FLARES. SPLAT! Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above. \nEXT. THE CITY - DAY \nRIVERS flank a TRIANGLE OF LAND where A CITY glows in the \nsunrise. Once proud and prosperous, its buildings now seem like tombstones. SEVEN BARRICADED BRIDGES span the rivers. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) \nProtected on three sides by mighty rivers, the city stands as a monument \nto man's ingenuity. At the center of it all is Fiddler's Green. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN \nA TV MONITOR broadcasts views of A KITCHEN, A PLUSH LIVING \nROOM, A DEN with a VIDEO FIREPLACE. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) \nLuxury living in the grand old style. Dine at one of three restaurants. Look for that perfect gift in our fabulous shopping mall. \nhe monitor shows a huge ATRIUM with shops and restaurants. \nGUERILLA (O.S.) \nThey make it sound nice. \nCHOLO (O.S.) \nIt is nice. Holding his case of Dom Perignon and his box of Cohibas, CHOLO looks with FOXY at a monitor mounted to a white-tiled subway station wall. Down the tunnel behind them, the other GUERILLAS unload supplies from CARGO CARRIERS parked on the platform. A sign reads, \"GOLDEN TRIANGLE/FIDDLER'S GREEN\". \nSECURITY GUARD \nWhat's in them boxes? \nCHOLO \nEssential supplies. For the man upstairs. \nl \nR \nThe Guard takes Cholo's weapons and returns a claim check. CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The \"mall\" we saw on TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin that lilts over a sound system. SHOPPERS, expensively over- dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at \"outdoor\" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable. \nEXT. \"GOLDEN TRIANGLE\" - MORNING \nFIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded by unoccupied high-rises that define \"the golden triangle\", a clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view. \nRILEY and CHARLIE cross a manicured plaza to a CHECKPOINT \nmanned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. Riley hands over his ID. \nRILEY \nQuittin' time, Deke. \nSECURITY GUARD \n(Holding up the ID) You're gonna need this. \nRILEY \n(Walking on) Nope. When I said quittin' time, I meant quittin' \ntime. \nEXT. \"GHETTO\" - MORNING \nRILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's \"ghetto\" zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs. \niley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back. \nCHARLIE \nWanna get a drink, Riley? Just ook at me, you can tell I could use a drink. \nRILEY \nLater. Gotta see a man about a car. \nCharlie follows Riley, who strides into... ...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him. He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey. \nMULLIGAN \nIrish accent) How long are you gonna let him push you around? If there was enough of us...if you all would join up with us...we could pull him down off his throne! Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away. \nRILEY \nYou can't fix a place like this, Mulligan. You just have to get out \nof it. \nMULLIGAN \nWe've got the firepower, Riley. If you and your friends would come in with us, we'd be unstoppable. Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to Charlie, who takes a swig. \nRILEY \nEveryone's stoppable. We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN stands behind him, looking feverish. \nMULLIGAN \nYou alright, son? \nBRIAN \nI'm fine, dad. As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm. \nRILEY \nAntibiotics. For your boy. Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand. When he looks up again, Riley is gone. \nH \nH \nEXT. GARAGE - MORNING \nTurning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door. Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers. \nRILEY \nWhere's the car? \nOBO \n(Waking) What car? \nRILEY \n...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand. \nSECURITY GUARD \n(To Cholo) Drop it! Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands. \nCHOLO \nHey, no problem. TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front door and rush into the kitchen. \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nNo problem, no problem! But there is a problem. There's a dead guy \nwalkin' around in here. \nTHE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the \nguards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK, including the EYE. \nBefore his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man. \nWOMAN \nYOU SELFISH BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME \nALONE HERE! \nShe fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work. \nThe bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him, BITING HIM again and again. Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man. \nBITTEN SECURITY GUARD \nI need help. I need help! \nCholo kills the bitten security guard, too. \nSURVIVING SECURITY GUARD \nYou...FUCK! \nCholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard. \nCHOLO \nYou wanna talk about this? I did what I had to do. I only did what I had to do! \nR \nT \nR \nR \nINT. \"THE ARENA\" - DAY \nRILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE. Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over. \nTOUT \n(Eyeing the weapons) Supply run last night, uh? Bet you have some money in your pocket. I can show you how to turn that money into more money. \nRILEY \nRoach. Where's Chihuahua? \nTOUT \nMaybe I can find him for you. Come on in. \nRiley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting \njoint in a Pancho Villa movie. \nRILEY \nLot of action tonight. \nTOUT \nGotta new kind of game. \niley strides toward a cluster of BETTORS. A very tall man \nstands among them, wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even higher out of a snake-skin hat band. \niley grabs him and spins him around. \nhe man's feet are off the ground. Way off the ground. Far from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. He's a Latino, who looks like a Chihuahua. And that's his name. CHIHUAHUA. \nC \nHIHUAHUA \nPut me down! Put me down! \nILEY \nBlack makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival. This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match. Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb. She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES with the force of... ...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh. On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON steps in front of them. \nGOON \nNo guns in here! Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on. \nS \nlack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming her to the ground. \nBlack hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite, RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's \ncollarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops. \nRed lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST. \nhe crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by... \n...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16. \nJust as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock misses Charlie completely. \nRiley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just on the other side of the bars. \nR \nILEY \nYou okay? \nF \nC \nShe nods gratefully. \nhihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed. Not because of the holes in his gut, but because... \nCHIHUAHUA \nMy suit! You fucked up my new suit! \nRiley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from... \n...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK! Spun around by the impact, she falls face down. \nChihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps coming, keeps FIRING, until... \n...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He drops like a broken pinata. \nRiley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is going to break out. But before it does... \nPOLICEMAN (O.S.) \nHold it! \n..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons. Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor. He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple. \nSLACK \nI'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT! \nSlack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder. \nSLACK (CONT'D) \nucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty. \nThey look into each other's eyes. \nRILEY \nSeen you around. \nSLACK \nSeen you around. \nY \nI \nA POLICEMAN steps over. \nPOLICEMAN \nThe hell happened here? \nRILEY \nSomebody shot the little fat man. \nPOLICEMAN \nYeah, I see that. You're under arrest. \nINT. BOARD ROOM - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY \nA UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below. Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows. \nCHOLO \nNo, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking \"members\" know what's in that garbage I take out for you? \nCholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar. \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nOU'LL LET ME IN OR I'LL... \nCholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman, who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling. \nKAUFMAN \nMaybe we should talk about this when you're less excited. \nKaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops one of the guards at the door. \nKAUFMAN (CONT'D) \nSoftly) I won't be needing this man any more. \nINT. STAIRWELL - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY \n42   T                                                        42 \nHE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the stairs. Cholo WHIRLS like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in the groin, the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door. \nc \nI \nw \nINT/EXT. JAIL - AFTERNOON \nRILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley. CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly. \nRILEY \n(To Slack) Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things? \nSLACK \nIt wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones. \nRILEY \nSame question. Why you? \nSLACK \nThey found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones. \nHARLIE \nWhat can you do? Every place is the same. \nRILEY \nPlaces with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada. \nSLACK \nWherever you're going, take me ith you. \nCHARLIE \nHe won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley) can make myself useful. And I an shoot. \nC \nS \nSLACK \nI can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier. \nRILEY \nI don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all! \nSLACK \nWhat's your story, Riley? \nThey look at each other, clearly attracted. \nR \nILEY \nI said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me...(turning away)...till everything changed. \nLACK \nEverything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not. \nA SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars. \nDouble or nothing? \nBARRETT \nSure. \nGUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back. \nGUS \nQuit scratching around back there. You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim. \nBARRETT \nI'm just standin' here. I'm not doin' nothing. \nThe SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot. Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line. \nT \nhere's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by erratic gusts of wind. \nBarrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position, jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals... A DEAD THING within arm's length. \nBarrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses. It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as... BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot. The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking. In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things. \nGUS SCREAMS. \nEXT. DEPOT - NIGHT \nCHOLO \nWhat's that? Screaming practice? \nGUNNER (O.S.) \nStenches! Jesus! They're all over the place! \nTHE DEPOT GUARD turns and runs toward his men. CHOLO'S TEAM unstraps weapons and gets ready for battle. \nCHOLO \n(Stopping them) Ain't our fight. Stenches are making it easy for us. \nC \nLet's grab the truck. \nHOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING. \nA GUNNER at a machine-gun battery opens fire on the WALKERS. Many of the rounds SPARK off the wire fencing. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING NIGHT \nCHOLO and his TEAM scramble into the vehicle. \nFOXY \nShould we send up some `sky flowers'? \nCHOLO \nNo. Those things want to get in here...let `em in. \nEXT. DEPOT - NIGHT \nTHE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their \"leader\". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The Dead Things SWARM into the depot. \nVROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night. \nK \nSOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly. NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat. The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging Number Nine's fingers on the trigger. RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the pavement to... ...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly, chest, and, finally, head. He drops. ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her \nweapon purposefully and scores a direct hit. \nOTHER DEAD THINGS SMACK at the steel doors that lead down to \nthe subway. They can't get through. Losing interest, they drift slowly away, until their attention is refocused by... \n...a GRUNT from Big Daddy, who is gazing toward the GLOW of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE across the river, closer now than before. The city. That's where he wants to be. That's \nwhere he's determined to go. \nINT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT \nKAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in front of him and eats. Across the table sits one of his board members, HARRISON SUTHERLAND. KNIPP enters. \nKNIPP \nPhone call, sir. \nKAUFMAN \nThank you, Knipp. I'll take it. \nKnipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the receiver and lifts it to his ear. \nKAUFMAN \nKAUFMAN \nWhich has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city. \nRILEY \nWhy don't you just send out your troops? \nC \nH \nKAUFMAN \nI don't want to lose them. I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo was your man. You might be able to get close enough to...do what has to be done. (Refilling his scotch) Do this for me and I'll grant you something in return. Residence in the Green. \nRILEY \nNot me. That's what Cholo wanted, and you didn't give it to him, did you? That's why he's out there waving a cannon at your ass. Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him with a glimmer of respect. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nGive me one of those vehicles, over \nin the depot, weapons, and enough ammunition to go north. \nKAUFMAN \nBut...there's nothing up north. \nRILEY \nThat's the idea. \nKAUFMAN \nAlright. You've named your price. An easy one to pay. \nR \nILEY \nOne more thing. My friends. They go with me. \nKAUFMAN \nTake them. \ne looks at Riley, a hint of desperation behind his eyes. \nKAUFMAN (CONT'D) \nan you find Dead Reckoning? Quickly? \nRILEY \nHow quickly? \nKAUFMAN \nBy midnight. \nRILEY \nI have a way. \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT \nDEAD RECKONING RUMBLES along a dark street, plowing into a DERELICT CAR, knocking it aside and rolling it down a small embankment, pinning THREE DEAD THINGS beneath. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nCHOLO'S TEAM laughs raucously at the fate of the zombies. \nCHOLO \n(Tense) Knock it off! \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT \nBIG DADDY steps out of the darkness, watching the lights of DEAD RECKONING recede. He hears desperate SQUEALING coming \nfrom under the toppled car. \nHe lumbers down the embankment. Pushes on one of the upturned \ntires. He can't turn the car by himself. He looks back to the road. Grunts. NUMBER NINE and OTHERS OF BIG DADDY'S GATHERING FORCE hurry to the car. They push. The car rolls over, freeing THE THREE DEAD THINGS. One of them used to be a BUTCHER. Still wearing \na blood-stained apron, carrying a meat cleaver, he looks at Big Daddy with something resembling gratitude. \nINT. FIDDLER'S GREEN WEAPONS STORAGE - NIGHT \nSOLDIERS pass out monster weapons to RILEY, CHARLIE, and SLACK. Riley straps on a K-90. Charlie turns one down. \nCHARLIE \nI like the iron I already got. \nSOLDIER \nEXT. 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT \nA LONG DOCK juts into the RIVER. DEAD RECKONING stops beside \nit. MOUSE jumps out. CHOLO stands in an open hatch. \nMOUSE \n(Looking around nervously) Don't leave me alone here long. \nCHOLO \nAt midnight. Give me a call. Let e know if we're rich or not. \nMouse nods, running off to hide in a BOAT SHED. \nEXT. DEPOT - NIGHT \nThe steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING. FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily. \nC \nHARLIE \nGeez. Cholo made a mess. \nRILEY \nCholo didn't do all this. \nClouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nStenches have been at this place. \nHe leads the way into the depot, his M-16 at the ready. Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. Everyone speaks in HUSHED tones. \nMANOLETE \nWhen the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down. That's how they got in. \nRILEY \nThat fencing was pushed in from outside. \nTEAHOUSE \nYou know how many stenches it would take to do that? \nRILEY \nThere's a thousand of them out there for every one of us. \nCHARLIE \nGood thing we're smarter. \nSLACK \nLook who's talkin'. \nRILEY \nThey're getting smart. I saw it in \nUniontown, last time out. They're learning how to work together. Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker, virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood. \nTEAHOUSE \nWhat do they want? Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE. \nSLACK \nThey want the city. \nRILEY \nThe city is us. They're after us. We pissed `em off one too many times. \nM \nO \nS \nT \nMANOLETE \nThey'll never get across the river. \nCHARLIE \nThank Heaven. \nRILEY \nGotta love the guy. He still believes in Heaven. Anyone got a radio? Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING! \nSuddenly, CHARLIE draws his .45 and FIRES AT SLACK! BLAM! The bullet buzzes just above her ear, blowing a WISP OF HAIR as... \nC \nT \nS \n...A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head. \nLACK \nThanks, Charlie. That was useful. \nThe WIND shifts and black SMOKE envelopes them. \nMANOLETE \nI can't see! \nRiley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash. \nhe team fans out around the T-Bird. The smoke is so thick they can't make out anything. Including each other. \nharlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. What he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him... \n..a FEMALE WALKER, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke. The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite... BLAM! Slack SHOOTS! Her bullet cuts closer than the one Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before \nDROPPING THE BRIDE. \nSLACK \nEven-Steven. \nCHARLIE \nNot! That hurt! I didn't hurt you! \nManolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash. \nRILEY \nHurry up. \nPILLSBURY \n(Impatient) Yellow to red! \nTEAHOUSE \nWhat the fuck does a Samoan know about hot-wiring cars? \nPILLSBURY \nFive thousand cars. Stole. Every year in Samoa. \nMANOLETE \nFifty thousand in Mexico. \nR \nPILLSBURY \nMexico got a million cars. Samoa got five thousand. Every one. Stolen. \nTHE T-BIRD'S ENGINE REVS. \nMANOLETE \nI GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! \nRiley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by the door... ...SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder. It's a FOREARM! It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him. \nTEAHOUSE \nGod! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?! \nTeahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly, the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping the limb loosely attached to... \n...A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird. Lifting itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE \nM \nSHOOTS it. \nanolete climbs up behind the wheel and...VROOOOOM!...pedal to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley. \nSLACK \n(Softly) How long does he have? \nRILEY \nI had a brother. Real brother, by birth. Bit. Hung on for six days. Before he turned. I was the one had to shoot him. \nSLACK \nAnd you said nothin' bad ever happened to you. \nWhat's there? \nRILEY \nPowder magazine. Where they keep the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning's cannons. \nINT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT \nMOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the window and dropping the Walker. Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees... ...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse is about to be chomped when... ...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head. Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees \nthat there are DOZENS MORE. \nEXT. RIVER - NIGHT \nCRANE UP TO REVEAL: \n...AN ARMY OF THE DEAD LINING THE RIVERBANK FOR AS FAR AS THE \nEYE CAN SEE. \nCLOSE ON: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows between he and his goal: FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so far. \nINT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nWHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer. KNIPP emerges from the rear. \nKNIPP \nAny word from Mister Denbo, sir? \nKAUFMAN \nNo. Pack us up. We might have to be leaving. \nKNIPP \nIn the helicopters? \nKAUFMAN \nWe'll only need one of them. \nINT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nPRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot. The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on the roof of the main building. \nFOXY \nLooks like no one's here. The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life. \nCHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN. \nCHOLO \nFoxy. You're elected. Get out there and see what the fuck. \nFoxy moves out through the open hatch. \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nSomebody go out and help. \nSCAR grabs his weapons. \nSCAR \nI'll go. \nEXT. RIVER - NIGHT \nONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind. The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows. Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then, with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall. Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing, waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it. He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the shallows. Into deep water. Over his head. \nINT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nThere are AUTOMOBILE TIRES, GARBAGE CANS, a rusted ANCHOR, a sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS OF DEAD THINGS...WALKING...ON THE RIVER BOTTOM...following BIG DADDY through the debris. \nINT. TENEMENT - NIGHT \nA knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside. \nSUTHERLAND \nHow much is Kaufman paying you and your men? \nGREASY MAN \nFour hundred a day. Each. \nSTYLES \nI'll pay you five thousand a day. Each. \nEXT. T-BIRD - NIGHT \nThe car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel. \nINT. T-BIRD - NIGHT \nRILEY looks at his watch. 11:40. \nRiley'd never do that. Just look at him, you can tell he'd never do that. \nRILEY \nKeep an eye on the hatches. If I get in, I'll try to leave one open. Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered. \nPILLSBURY \nI like dat man. You go help `im. I take care of dis sissy. \nPillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, POUNDS Manolete's temple with a mighty fist. He drops like a lead weight. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT \nThe door to the roof opens and the GREASY MAN from \"downtown\" steps out of a fire stair with ANOTHER GREASY MAN. SUTHERLAND remains inside the door. \nGREASY MAN \nI don't know about this. I mean... \nleavin' people behind... \nSUTHERLAND \nKaufman was gonna leave people behind. So we're leaving him. \nThe Greasy Men go trotting across the rooftop. As they climb into TWO HELICOPTERS, we realize that they are PILOTS. \nEXT. HILLSIDE STREET - NIGHT \nRILEY walks down the road. The GROWLING of the diesels is getting louder, the GLOW from the high-beams brighter. Riley is startled by a NOISE behind him. He whirls around and sees CHARLIE approaching. \nCHARLIE \nEverything's cool back there. Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks his watch again. 11:52. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) \nToo late to send me back. \nRILEY \nPut on your Sunday smile. Try to look friendly. \nCHARLIE \nI am friendly. Just look at me you can tell I'm friendly. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nIn the cab, PRETTY BOY eases off the gas. CHOLO looks out the windshield as the headlights strike... \nCHOLO \nDenbo. And his idiot. (Beat) Stop. Gimme the mike. \nThe vehicle crunches to a stop forty yards away. Pretty Boy hands Cholo a microphone. Cholo speaks into it. \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nHow'd you get up here, Riley? \nINTERCUT: BETWEEN THE STREET AND DEAD RECKONING'S CAB. \nRILEY \nGrabbed the T-Bird. \nCHOLO \nWhat are you doin' up here? \nRILEY \nTracking you. With this. \nRiley holds up his \"Game Boy\". Cholo looks surprised. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nTruck's got a little transmitter in her belly. Sorry I never told you. \nCHOLO \nYou were always a smart guy, Riley. Much smarter'n me. \nRILEY \nYou went and took off without inviting us along. \nCHOLO \nYou weren't around to get invited. Anyway, I figured you wouldn't want in on this. \nRILEY \nWe want in on anything you got goin'. \nCHOLO \nBack to the city. \nCHOLO \nNot this horse. You got the T-Bird? \nI'll take that. \nFOXY \nMe, too. \nFOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side. Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at Cholo and Foxy. \nRILEY \nYou guys'd be safer coming with us. \nCHOLO \nNah, you'd never let me have any fun. \nRILEY \nT-Bird's down that driveway over there. Guns and ammo inside. \nCHOLO \nThanks. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nRILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow. SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean the blood off Riley's neck. He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture. \nSLACK \nAlmost lost you there. \nRILEY \nI don't get lost so easy. (To PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across the water. \nPRETTY BOY \nThe bridges into the city are all bricked up. \nPRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing the \"GOLDEN TRIANGLE\" bordered by the rivers and the barricaded bridges spanning them. \nSLACK \nWe could blast our way through. \nRILEY \nDon't want to. If the stenches got \nin, there's a war going on in the city. We take any of those bridges we'll end up right in the middle of it. Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nWe've gotta come in above the throat. His finger continues down the monitor to \"THE THROAT\" at the base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the two rivers. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nWhat was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside. We've gotta give them a way out. \nC \nC \nE \nC \nC \nEXT. FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast. LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be heard from far below. \nEXT. \"GOLDEN TRIANGLE - NIGHT \nIn the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things. \nCLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets, back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away. \nEXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nCHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees. \nHOLO \nI got it. \nWFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow. \nHOLO (CONT'D) \nCome on, let's go. \nBLAM! \nRiley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot. \nSLACK \nYou missed. \nCHARLIE \nNope. I blew its ass off. The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet \nIT'S STILL RUNNING! \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) \nJust didn't hit it in the head. \nSLACK \n(Realizing) Jesus. It's dead. \nCHARLIE \nThey all are. SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS. Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off. The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow. Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before... ...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her! She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to... ...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD \nFLY. But there are too many. He can't shoot them all. \nINT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nRILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting danger within. He steps through the opening... ...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a \ngenerator. He flips it. The motor roars to life. \nHe turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It \nGROANS from disuse as he pulls it. \nEXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nRED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night. The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly. \nEXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT \nTHREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge. SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether holds it within inches of the shore. Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but... \n...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting. Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free. \nT \nSlack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer. No paddles. The current carrying her away. \nCHARLIE \nSlack! \nINT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nHearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window and sees... ...SLACK being taken downstream. \nEXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nRILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by... \n...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge. \nRiley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward the gearworks and... \n...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It drops with a PLUNK into the river below. \nEXT. RIVER - NIGHT \nSLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins \nto paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long and slimy. It looks like a snake! But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on. Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope to become taut. \nA FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER! \nSlack SCREAMS. It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats off on the current. he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore. Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until... ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's in the war zone. \nEXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nTHE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE. \nR \nILEY \nBring her over as soon as you can! \nCharlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING. Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and... ...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side. He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward Slack and the city. \nEXT. \"GOLDEN TRIANGLE\" - NIGHT \nSLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN \nHIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a panic. Slack grabs him. \nSLACK \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nbeen bit, Mister K. I'm a dead man, so I don't care about nothin' no more. Still care about you, though. I wanna make sure you come to the same end as me. \nLANG! CLANG! CLANG! The Dead Things at the glass doors are POUNDING now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe. \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nhey're going to get you, Mister K. want them to get you. \nKaufman raises his gun and aims at Cholo, who aims back with his crossbow. \nK \nK \nK \nP \nCHOLO (CONT'D) \nut it down, old man, unless you'd rather die right now. \nBIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic hammer to POUND at the safety glass. \naufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door. Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman. \nNIPP \nJust let us go, Mister DeMora. Let us get out of here. \nCHOLO \n(Calmly reloading) You can go, Knipp, but not him. \nKaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees. \nCRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter; it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND! \nPuzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft. Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through. \nKaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder. \nAUFMAN \nYou fucking spic bastard! \nCHOLO \nI think we should talk when you're a little less excited. \nKaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as... \nCRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More HANDS POKE through. \naufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple. \nR \nM \nThe commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds. ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired. It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead. Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see... \nBIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose. \nKaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo. \nK \nNIPP \nBoss. We gotta get outa here! \nKnipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them, moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door. \nEXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT \nTH-BOOOOM! The roadbed of the drawbridge drops into place. VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING rumbles across the span. \nINT. JAIL - NIGHT \nKEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack. \nMULLIGAN \n(To his men) Let's go get our guns, boys. \nEXT. NEAR THE \"THROAT\" - NIGHT \nILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees... \n...the \"THROAT\", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them. There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED. Terrible SCREAMS fill the air. \nR \nC \nRiley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines, the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as... \nBig Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs. It's the man who shot him. The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit...\"Texaco\". He moves deliberately toward the pump. \nKAUFMAN \nPull out! PULL OUT! \nK \nNIPP \nSorry, sir. Keys are in the pump. \nBig Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts. The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction. \nUsing the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy POUNDS on the windshield, three times, before the SAFETY GLASS COBWEBS. He POKES the nozzle through the flexible fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. Gasoline FLOODS into the car. \nKNIPP (CONT'D) \nord! \nTCHUNG! Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open. As Knipp tries to run, he is GRABBED by Big Daddy. \nKNIPP (CONT'D) \nORD! \nBig Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman, cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and, surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street. \nThe nozzle remains stuck in the \"fabric\" of the windshield. Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs the keys. As he starts back toward the car... \n...WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's one of the WALKING DEAD. It's... \nT \nK \nK \n...CHOLO. \naufman shakes his head in disbelief. \nKAUFMAN \nN-no, y-you're dead. (Realization dawning) Oh my God. You're dead! \nTHE CHOLO THING reaches for Kaufman, vengeance in its eyes. \naufman breaks for the driver's door. He never makes it. The Cholo Thing grabs him and SLAMS him down across the hood. Leans over him. Opens a drooling mouth. Kaufman whimpers. \nB \nRRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball. \nKaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT, rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked Kaufman, and... \n...WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air. \nHROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see...Big Daddy is almost smiling. \nEXT. \"THE THROAT\" - NIGHT \nDEAD RECKONING approaches the electrified fences from beyond. \nPRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER) \nGet back! Get back! We're gonna blow the fences! The CROWD screams and starts to clear the area. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nCHARLIE works a joystick. The cannon turret GRINDS above. He takes aim at an area of the fences that is rapidly emptying of people. \n43      EXT.

The ELECTRIFIED FENCES are BLOWN APART. \nn the dissipating SMOKE, RILEY is the first one through the opening. Within seconds, CITIZENS start toward it, heading the other way.

Eating them. \n", "test1_input": "(Through an open hatch) Kid, these are the toughest guys in the `hood.

(To Mike) Come with me, kid. I'll show you the ropes. Mike climbs out and gets on the back of Cholo's motorcycle. \nRILEY \nWhere you goin'? \nCHOLO \nTo get supplies. Essential supplies. That's job our job, ain't it? \nG \nR \nEXT. UNIONTOWN FOODMART - NIGHT \nTHE WHITE MOVING VAN pulls up to a supermarket. THE DEAD THINGS in the parking lot, gazing at the FIREWORKS, barely notice the vehicle. MARKSMEN keep the lot covered as GUERILLAS carry CASES OF CANNED GOODS out of the supermarket and into the van. The team has this down to a science. ILEY'S VOICE comes over one Guerilla's hand-held radio. \nRILEY (O.S. RADIO FILTER) \nHow's the food? \nGUERILLA #1 \n(Into his radio) Lousy, but there's lots of it. \nEXT.

Harry's riderless motorcycle fishtails up the street and hits the side of a building. arry tries to get up. TWO DEAD THINGS attack him.

All dismount and start toward the entrance. They stop as DEAD RECKONING pulls up and RILEY and CHARLIE climb out. \nCHARLIE \nNothin' in there but booze. Booze ain't essential. \nFOXY \nA jug of good Kentucky goes for fifteen hundred back in town. \nRILEY \n(To Cholo) I'm not risking anybody's ass just so you can pick up some side money. \nR \nCHOLO \nNot askin' you to. \nCholo and Foxy start into the liquor store. The doors are wide open. All that can be seen from outside is darkness. \nILEY \nMike! Wait! But Mike has followed the others inside. \nINT. UNIONTOWN STATE STORE - NIGHT \nCHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not. Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall- unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the \nrefrigerator. Re-strapping his crossbow, he opens the door. Reaches in for the case of champagne. His two hands grab it. \nA THIRD HAND GRABS IT! \nCholo looks up. The refrigerator has no back wall. A DEAD \nTHING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL. Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They \nroll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip. \nAt the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle. Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses. \nCholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand. The Dead Thing's head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes flash. It's the first time we've seen him scared. BLAM! CHARLIE FIRES one round, right into the center of the swastika on the Zombie's forehead. The Thing crumples. \nMIKE \nNice shootin'. \nCHARLIE \nGood shootin'. Ain't no such thing as nice shootin'. \nR \no \nR \nM \nA FOOT KICKS the Zombie off Cholo, who looks up to see... ...RILEY extending a hand to help him to his feet. \nRILEY \nClose one. \nCHOLO \nI'm still here, ain't I? Everyone relaxes. Cholo picks up the case of Dom. The others head toward the front of the store. TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past. In the gloom behind stacks of cartons... ...A DEAD HAND appears. Reaching. \nCHOLO \nShit! Look out, kid! The hand grabs Mike around the ankle! Mike turns, raising his gun. Too late. A DEAD UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, the skin on half its face STRIPPED DOWN TO BONE, RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth! ike SCREAMS, staggers into a wall, and drops to a seated position on the floor. Riley and Charlie spin around at the \nsound of his cry. Cholo, closest to Mike, pulls his crossbow and fires an arrow through the Zombie's head. \nC \nHOLO \nFuckin' rookies. \nCholo tucks away the crossbow, grabs a box of Cohibas off a counter, and runs outside with Foxy. Riley goes to Mike. \nILEY \n(Kneeling) It's alright, son. You're gonna be alright. \nMIKE \nNo. I'm dead. You get bit by one f those things and you become what they are. \nRiley wraps a strong arm around Mike and lifts him. Mike quickly plants the barrel of his .45 under his chin and... \nBLOWS HIS OWN BRAINS OUT! \n", "test1_id": 186, "test2_input": "No buts. \nCLIFF \nBut... \nKaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside. \nKAUFMAN \nTake him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore. \nW \nF \nO \nAt the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away. \nS \nUTHERLAND \n(To Styles) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us. \nEXT. CARNEGIE - NIGHT \nn an overgrown suburban street, a LAWN TRACTOR, driven by a GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nCHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield. \nCHOLO \nIf I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there. \nCLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20. \nOXY \nHe's never gonna pay. \nCHOLO \nHe knows it's his ass if he doesn't. \nCholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and SHOOTS the Gardener in the head. \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds. \nBig Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand. Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches the wall. HACK! The meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it. REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at... ...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was before, though it's still across the river. \nS \nR \nR \nEXT. MCKEE'S ROCKS - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance of a \"Game Boy\". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT moving along a MAP. \nRILEY (O.S.) \nTurn left up here. SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that Slack is effected by the desolation she sees. \nILEY \nHow long since you been out here? \nSLACK \nNever been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city. \nILEY \nPull over. \nSLACK \n(Surprised) Huh? \nRILEY \nYou said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over. \nhe does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE. \nRILEY \nI made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea... \nRiley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are slogging through the marsh. \nC \n", "test2_true": "R \nMANOLETE \nSome choice. \nPILLSBURY \nG \nood choice. I like see Canada. \nPillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again. \nILEY \nCharlie, keep these two covered. \nCharlie pulls his .45. Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the \"Game Boy\" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP. \nRILEY (CONT'D) \nTake a right onto Route Six. \nSlack pulls out. \nSLACK \nThis is what you were thinking about all along. You got me out here figuring I'm a boy scout, and now you're telling me we're just \nstealing a fucking car? \nILEY \nYou have a problem with that? \nSLACK \nNo. I like the way you think. \nHARLIE \nI like the way he thinks, too. Just look at me you can tell I like the way he thinks. \nRILEY \nTake another right. \nSLACK \nHow do you know which way you're going? Riley holds up the \"Game Boy\". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT shifts onto another MAP. \nRILEY \nI built a homing device into Dead Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nDEAD RECKONING stops on a long road, at the end of which stands... ...a MILITARY COMPLEX. THE BEAM of a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps back and forth over the buildings, a sign of life. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nCHOLO checks his watch. 11:29. He speaks into a TRANSMITTER. \nCHOLO \nMouse. Anything? \nINT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT \nMOUSE stands in the shed, holding a transmitter of his own. \nMOUSE \nNot yet. No boat. No money. No nothing. \nINT.

Every week we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out \nKaufman's garbage. People he wanted off the streets.

Just beyond the barrels we see MANOLETE closing in on DEAD \nRECKONING, raising his machine gun. A DEAD THING advances behind him. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nCHOLO charges RILEY. Grabs him around the throat. \nCHOLO \nFix it! \nRILEY \nNot a chance. Riley tosses the \"Game Boy\" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches out after it. \nEXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT \nMANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open hatch. Where CHOLO is standing. Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT! RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder. The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker, destroying it. \nINT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT \nFOXY, distracted by the mayhem, lets CHARLIE get the drop on him. ANCHOR and SCAR go for their guns.

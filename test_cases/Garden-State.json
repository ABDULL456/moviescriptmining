{"train": "GARDEN STATE \nWritten by \nZach Braff \nIN BLACK: \nAIRPLANE PILOT (O.S.) (panicky; through crackly \nRADIO) Los Angeles Tower, this is Transworld two-two Heavy, we are going down! Repeat... Engines two and three are... L.A. Tower this is MaydayI Mayday! \nTOWER (O.S.) (through crackly radio) 2-2 Heavy, Pull upt Pull up! The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi prayer. \nINT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT \nTHE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE: SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer. \nANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits peacefully; unaffected. \nHe calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows directly on him. He looks up to \nTHE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN \nit BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an \nELECTRONIC TELEPHONE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BEDROOM -- MORNING \nWhiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in which he sleeps. \nHIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams like they're chasing each other in a game of tag. THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes stop moving. \nVOICE ON MACHINE (0.S.) Andrew... This is your father. LARGE'S EYES slowly float open. \nVOICE Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you don't call me back so I don't know how to do this. If I can't... if you're not gonna return my calls then there's no way for us to communicate. So uh... '(starts to cry) \nLook, I don't know how to do . this, but you're gonna need to come home now. Last night uh... Your mother died last night, Andrew. She uhh... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she uh... she drowned... last night she drowned in the bath... \nBEEP. The machine cuts the voice off. LARGE'S EYES processing. \nThey elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float closed. He falls back to sleep. \nFADE TO BLACK-' \nIN BLACK: The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink. \nINT. BATHROOM -- MORNING \nLarge appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the mirror he's been staring into. \nHis face and chest are immediately replaced with the two dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately line the shelves of his medicine cabinet. \nHe closes the mirror doors and stares at himself. \nMUSIC CUB., (\"DON'T PANIC\" BY COLDPLAY) \nEXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER \nLarge rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break. He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries to find an address while checking a piece of paper. He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL- stairs. \nAfter a moment he looks to his right through a window into a gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him. Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way down, where he moves to the \"Up\" one and rises towards the next level. His expression never changes. \nINT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY \nA casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him; they're even dressed alike. \nASSISTANT Casting, please hold. casting, please hold. \nWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight foot photograph of \"Urkel\" wagging his finger at the camera. A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines to themselves. \nThe ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him. \n(BEAT) Well something to chew on --fuck. Bamboo... whatever. \nLARGE I'll see what I can find. He turns and walks off . \nVIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.) Waiter number twelve, flight number 121 with non-stop service to Newark International will be departing from gate D-32. \nON LARGE'S FACE CLOSE as he closes his eyes and we: \nFADE TO BLACK: \nIN BLACK: THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into \nINT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY \nTHE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his eyes closed in pain for a brief second. A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water. The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of \"Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady\" with synthesizer accompaniment. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nA large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin. Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN. We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto: HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words \"ONCE and \"TWICE\". The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket. Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young Black woman. HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the ceremony. WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs 26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black yarmulkes. They look up as Large approaches. \nMARX \nHOLY SHITS \nLARGE T'sup. \nDAVE Holy shit! \nMARK Largeman, what the hell are you doin' here? \nLARGE \n(EMBARRASSED) Oh... uh that's my mom. \nDAVE Fuck. \nMARK Puck. Sorry. \n(BEAT) Well... welcome home- \nLARGE Thanks. Yeah. How you guys doin'? \nMARK Same. \nDAVE Same. \nLARGE Nice. Silence. \nMARK Where the fuck you been, man? You're like still acting and shit, right? \nLARGE Yeah. \nDAVE In LA right? \nLARGE Yeah. \nMARK That's cool. I hear that place is pretty tucked up, man. I got a cousin who's a writer out there. He says that place is mad crazy. Coke everywhere, parties, horny-ass bitches... \nDAVE Who? \nMARK What? \nDAVE Which cousin? \nMARK Terry. \nDAVE Terry's in LA? I thought he was gettin' his GED down in Newark. \nMARK No bitch, he's in LA now. He's a writer. He's writin' a movie about snowboarders or some shit, X don't know. I should introduce you to him Largeman, maybe you guys could do something together. \nLARGE Great. \nDAVE So what are you doin' tonight, man? \nLARGE Nothing... no plans. I'm just here for a couple days... nothing. \nDAVE You should come out with us, we're gonna head over to the Gleason's house. He's having some huge fuckin' party tonight or something. \nLARGE oh. okay. \nSYLVIA You're gonna love the material. I used the leftovers from your Mother's design. Gorgeous. \nINT. HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nLarge flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper, towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same pattern. He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his head to the right and stares at his body. He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his head and forearms are floating in mid-air. Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in mid-air. \nTNT. GIDEON'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS GIDEON LARGENAN sits alone at his desk. Large enters. \nLARGE Hi. \nG IDEON \nHELLO- \nLARGE How you doin'? \nGIDEON \"Well besides that tire. Lincoln, how was the show?\" \nLARGE You know I'm not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry. \nGIDEON Mmnn. \n(BEAT) Did you see Cynthia? \nLARGE From afar at the cemetery. \nGIDEON She's on call tonight; she volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue Squad. She's doing so well in med school. \nLARGE Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really happy that everything's working out so well for her. She deserves that. \nGIDEON I have very fond memories of the two of you running around here when you were little kids like brother and sister. Silence. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) So how are you? \nLARGE I'm okay. \n(SEARCHING) I've been getting these pretty bad headaches lately. It feels like a quick little lightning storm in my brain and then it's gone. I was thinking maybe you could set me up to get it checked out while I'm here. \nGIDEON Go see Dr. Cohen first thing tomorrow morning. Re's a neurologist in my building. I'll call him and he'll fit you in. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Silence. Large nods. \nLARGE House looks great. \nGIDEON Oh? That's nice. We've been... doing a lot of work on it. \nLARGE Really? \nGTDEON Actually, no. I don't know why I just said that. We haven't done anything to it. \n(BEAT) We cleaned it for this; for this whole thing. Janice has been cleaning. \nLARGE The bathroom in the hall. I noticed someone redid that. \nGIDEON Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this whole thing together out there. I think there's enough food out there for... everybody. I mean, more.than everybody... there's a lot of food out there. \nLARGE okay. I think I'll go have some.. \nGIDEON There's dessert too. \nLARGE Great. Okay. \nGIDEON Cake or something. \nLARGE Great. Large starts to leave. \nGIDEON I'm glad you're here. Large stops in the doorway. \nGIDEON (CONT'D} Saying goodbye is important. I'm glad you could... fit it in. They nod at each other. Large walks out. \nCUT TO : \nINT. LARGE 'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nA tattered, vintage American Flag site framed above the bed. Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to mean anything and then \nA PICTURE Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous \"chicken- foot\" slippers and smile from ear to ear. Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not yet requiring a wheelchair. He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's \nJESSE That's fucked up. \nLARGE Yeah... So I definitely wanna come by and check out your new pad. You gotta tell me what happened. \nJESSE Basically, \"The Man bought my silent Velcro patent. \nLARGE What? \nJESSE Well you knew I was an inventor right? \nLARGE No. But I haven't seen you since we \nWERE SIXTEEN- \nJESSE Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an inventor yet. Anyway I developed this little item that's just like Velcro but doesn't make that annoying Velcro noise. \nLARGE now much did they buy it for? \nJESSE A lot. \nLARGE Wow. So what are you doing now? \nJESSE Nothing. They laugh. \nLARGE Seriously. \nJESSE Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've never been so bored in all my life. The first month I bought a whole bunch of shit, but then that got boring. But I... nothing. \nLARGE That's so crazy. But I mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do? Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something? \nJESSE I'm not really motivated to do much at all. It's kind of funny, I guess I had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money. But now that I've got more than I ever dreamed, I'm really not sure what to do with myself. I stare at walls a lot. \nDAVE Can you believe that shit, Large? This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire. I got a thousand ideas, but I gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die. They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book. Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19. As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on. \nMARK Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book. \nLARGE Oh no thanks, man. \nMARK Really? But you're like a movie star and shit. \nLARGE No, no thanks. \nJESSE Well then here. Eat this. Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY FACE on it. \nJESSE (CONT'D) Welcome home. \nLarge takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks around at everyone else in the room eating them; including the cute girls. \nLARGE I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh. \nDANA Should we play a game? \nDAVE other than golf? They laugh. \nKELLY No, let's play Spin The Bottle. The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group. \nLARGE \n(TO JESSE) I'm not playing Spin The Bottle; how old are we? or more importantly, how old are they? Jesse passes Large the joint. \nJESSE They're all legal. I think. He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control. \nKELLY Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna do? \nJESSE The girl has a point. \nMARK Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to neck. \nMARK (CONT'D} First let's finish Daddy's golf tequila. Then we can use this bottle. The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv start. \nTHE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED- \nUP AND SLOW MOTION. The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name. \nALL Large! He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed directly at him. \nJESSE Largeman, this is Dana. Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room. \nLARGE What? \nTIM No, I can't. \nCAROL Yes, you can. \nMARK What the fuck is Klingon? \nLARGE Like the Star. Trek guys? \nCAROL Yup. He can talk in their language. \nTIM She's kidding. \nCAROL No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are you being shy? \nMARK Don't be shy, Tim. \nLARGE Yeah let's hear it, man? \nTIM It's just made up. The guy who plays the wizard at work is a Trekky. I don't really... \nCAROL He's being shy. Say what you said to me last night. \nTIM No. \nMARS Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her last night. Silence. Everyone stares at Tim. \nTIM I gotta get going anyway. \nMARK \n(SHARP) Say what you said to her last night. \nTIM Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo. They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing. \nMARK You've got to be kidding me. \nCAROL It means, \"I like to mate after battle.\" \nTIM \n(QUICKLY) That's not what I said. \nCAROL Yes. \nTIM No, that wasn't the one I said. This one means \"kill Kirk\" and also 'hallelujah\" depending on the context. \nMARK You must have gotten it confused with \"Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth pleep.\" Theylaugh. \nCAROL That was good, honey. \nMARK You know what that means, Tim? \nTIM No I don't know the whole language, I just... \nMARK well I do. It means get the fuck out of my house before I chop your fuckin' head off. Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop laughing. \nCAROL Mark, he's a knight. \nMARK He's just a fast-food knight. \nTIM I should get going anyway. He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark just laugh. \nTIM (CONT'D) Thanks for the cereal. By the way, it says \"balls\" on your face. Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's reflection. \nLARGE \nYOU ASSHOLE: \nMARK My Mom did it. \nCUT TO: \nIT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink. Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened, colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands next to them watching the TV. \nCAROL What's this? She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it. \n(TIGHT WHISPER) Stop it. Heel. No thrust. Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away- He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big headphones. \nLARGE (CONT'D) Got any suggestions? \nGIRL Kick his balls. \nMRS- LUSTN Ready for me? \nThe girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is gone. \nGIRL \n(IMPERSONATING \nRECEPTIONIST) Not yet Mrs. Lubin. The dog humps away. The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large. \nGIRL (CONT'D) \n(SOFTLY) Kick his balls. \nLARGE I don't want to hurt him. \nGIRL It's the only way to teach them. I have three Dobermans. If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly I'd never get anything done. \nLARGE Yeah, but I don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs. Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now. \nGIRL Not yet, here comes the lipstick. They sit and watch him go. \nGIRL (CONT'D) Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow. WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still but the dog's thrusting pelvis. \nRECEPTIONIST Mrs. Lubin? \nMRS. LUBIN Yes. \nRECEPTIONIST We're ready for you. \nMRS. LUBIN Okay. C'mon Arthur. Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her side to lead her into the office. \nLARGE I feel so used. \nShe laughs. \nLARGE (CON2''D) Thanks for your help. Or at least your good intentions. \nSAM I recognize you. \nLARGE Oh, did you go to Columbia High? \nSAM No, not from high school, from TV. Didn't you play the retarded quarterback. \nLARGE (Wishing she'd go away) Yeah. \nSAM Are you really retarded? He stares at her. \nLARGE No. \nSAM That's cool. Great job, man. You were- I mean I thought you were really retarded. You were just as good as that corky kid and he's really retarded. I mean if there's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win. You'd kick Corky's ass. \nLARGE I got to fill this thing out, but thank you for... that. \nSAM Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt you'd know him. He was on \"Sheena\" once as some gnome or something. I think that's great though. \nLARGE Thank you. \nSAM Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up; that was - it was emotional. I mean I didn't cry, but I think my Dad did. \n(MORE) \nI couldn't totally see, but he got up to go to the bathroom and I think I heard him sniffle. Could've been dander... \nLARGE Well thanks. Thank you. \nSAM So are you doing anything else? \nLARGE No. Not right now I'm just... \nSAM Any other retarded roles? I'm sure you could definitely get more of those. \nDOCTOR I'm sorry about you're Mother. \nLARGE Yeah. Thank you. \nDOCTOR I must have missed you at Shiva last night. \nLARGE Yeah. \nDOCTOR So how long have these headaches been going on? \nLARGE Well I think I've had them in some form since I was a little kid. But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year. \nDOCTOR (looking at chart) How long have you been on the Lithium? \nLARGE Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so. \nDOCTOR And what about Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Depakote; did any of that ever help you? \nLARGE No. I mean I don't know. It's recently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem. only I'd never know it, because as far back as I can remember I've been medicated. I grew up on it. I left them in LA. This is the first time I haven't had it in my body since I can remember. \nDOCTOR Well it'll leave your body pretty fast. I'll write you a prescription. \nLARGE Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation. \nDOCTOR Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that? \nLARGE E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad. So uh... he... I think he'd prefer me to stay on it. He likes to think it makes me happy. And I let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy. \nDOCTOR Well look, I'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you won't worry that it's anything serious. But to be honest, I think the headaches are something else. Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety. Things you'd never expect. I found my ex-best friend's cuff links in my wife's puree and I couldn't get an erection for a year and a half. \n(BEAT) For example. \nLARGE But that doesn't really feel like it. I mean I don't feel stressed or really anxious at all. \nDOCTOR Well with all the Lithium he's had you on it's amazing you can even hear me right now_ \nLARGE Oh, right. \nDOCTOR First of all, I do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isn't your father. That just's something that should have been remedied years ago. He knows better. Secondly, I'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not; I don't know your story. But my opinion, since you're paying for it, is that those drugs may help as a means to an end. But if you're not In any sort of therapy, sooner or later what's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it's little head out of the water. Just something to think about. \n(MORE) \n,beat) But, for now, let's have a look at you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATSCAN ROOM - LATER \nMUSIC PLAYS AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel. AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his chest. THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being sucked.into the Catscan tunnel. \nEXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY \nLarge drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand. He pulls up alongside her. \nLARGE Why were you really there? \nSAM Charging. I'm a robot. \nLARGE Do you lie a lot? \nSAN What do you consider a lot? \nLARGE Enough for people to call you a liar. \nSAM People call me lots of things. \nLARGE Is one of them \"liar\"? \nSAM I could say \"no\", but how will you know I'm not lying. \nLARGE Because I`ll choose to trust YOU. \nSAM You can do that? \nLARGE I can try. \nSAM Who's bike is this? \n(BEAT) He might drive a bike; wherever he is. \nLARGE Well we're off to a great start. \nSAM okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird, man. About random stuff too; and I don't even know why I do it. It's like a tick. I swear, sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think: \"Wow, that's not even remotely true. \nLARGE So how am I supposed to know what's real? \nSAM Well, I always feel bad and admit them when they're lies. \n(BEAT) Can you trust that? \nLARGE Open the door. \nTNT. SAM'S HOUSE: FOYER -- CONTINUOUS She pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous Doberman Pinchers BARK and CLIMB all over Large. \nSAM Down, Kevin! Mom! Kick their balls! Kick their balls! Anthrax, heel! Mom! Sam tries slapping them on their backs. OLIVIA, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster with a bloody nose. \nOLIVIA Everybody downl Who wants to eat? Do you want to eat? Well then get the fuck off him! Kevin! Steven! \nGET OFF[ She smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the other room. \nOLIVIA (CONT' D) I'm so sorry, we just don't have the time to train' em. Who has time to train'em? When they were puppies it was cute, but now it's like having a herd of Clydesdales. It's just too much. \n(MORE) \nKevin's the baby, he really just follows the others but last week Anthrax and Steven killed a dove and left him on the front porch. Or maybe it was a pigeon, he was grey. 'Member that, Samantha? \nSAM Mom, this is .Andrew... \nOLIVIA Welcome, welcome. The place is a wreck, I'm so sorry. You look very familiar. \nSAM He's the retarded quarterback. \nOLIVIA Shut up ! Oh my God ! You are the retarded quarterback. You were so good on that show. Now I'm really ashamed. Look at this place. And I'm wearing sweat pants. (to Sam, through her teeth, while nodding at \nLARGE) is he really retarded? \nLARGE No. \nOLIVIA Oh, tell me, what's that Alan Thicke like? I've heard he's a cocky son of a bitch. \nLARGE No, he's a really nice guy. \nOLIVIA Oh. Well, welcome, welcome. Samantha I told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage. She holds up a dead hamster. \nSAKI I forgot, Mom. \nOLIVIA Well you forgot and now Jelly's dead. Luckily I got peanut Butter out in time. \n(TO LARGE) We have to get the only hamster on planet Earth that can't figure out a stupid hamster wheel. Now the rest of 'am can't even get a good sweat going. \n(MORE) \nThere's a shoe box on the kitchen counter. You can do the honors. I have to run to work. She sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the hamster. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) It was so nice to meet you... Andrew right? \nLARGE Yes. \nOLIVIA Samantha put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly. She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone. They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they both start laughing. \nSAM Come on in. They walk into the LIVING ROOM. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nBig couches with tattered afghans on them. A Christmas tree with the lights on in the far corner; a few unwrapped presents underneath. An enormous hamster labyrinth, a fish tank, three cats, a bird cage. \nSAM So this is it. \nLARGE It's nice. \nSAM No it's not. You don't have to say that just 'cause you can't think of anything else to say. \nLARGE I'm not. It's really nice. It's very cozy. You guys are a little early on the tree, huh? \nSAM Yeah, well we never got around to taking it down, so when it got to be fall again we just figured we might as well leave it. Are you freaked out? You're totally freaked out aren't you? \nLARGE It's like the Wailing Wall. \nSAM What? \nLARGE The Wailing Wall. It's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel. It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans. \nSAM Wow, so you're like really Jewish? Large laughs. \nSAM (CONT'D) Yeah, you are aren't you? \nLARGE No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but I'm not really Jewish. I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple or anything. But I don't know any Jews who go to temple. The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur. One day; the day of repentance. Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone? \nSAM I don't really believe in God. \nLARGE Just tickle. \nSAM Oh, I believe in Tickle_ They laugh. A nice moment. They hold eye contact. THE AWESOME \nMUSIC PLAYS. \nSAM (CONT'D) We're not gonna like make out or anything. \nLARGE What? \nSAM I'm sorry, I just totally ruined the moment didn't I? \nLARGE No, I wasn't... \nSAM I just mean we're not gonna like make out. \nLARGE Okay. I hadn't planned on... \nSAM I didn't mean to put that out there, that was lame. BLAAAAHRH. That was so dumb. You know what I do when I'm feeling completely unoriginal? She stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands. \nSAM (CONT'D) \nLABA-LABA-LABA-LABAL Large states. \nSAM (CONT ' D) I make a noise or I do something that no one has ever done. And then I feel like... unique again; even if only for a second. \nLARGE So no one has ever done that? \nSAM Not in this spot, no. You just witnessed a completely original moment in history. It's refreshing. You try one. \nLARGE No. \nSAM Come on. \nLARGE No. Trust me yours was good enough for both of us. \nSAM Come on. What are you shy? This is your chance to do something that has never, ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence. If nothing else, you'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this. He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it. \nLARGE ZzzZzz. Be stares at her. \nLARGE (CONT'D) How was that? \nSAM Oh, I've done that one before. She bursts out laughing. He smiles. SAM (CONT ' t3 ) So I got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him. You warms help? \nC'AM' TO: \nEXT. SAWS BACKYARD-- DAY \nRusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty above-ground swimming pool. Sam carries the shoe box as they walk around behind the pool to reveal \nA SMALL GATED PET CEMETERY About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different pets. \nLARGE Wow. \nSAM Yeah. \nLARGE I mean this is... \nSAM I know. They stand in silence. \nSAM (CONT'D) It's not that we're bad pet owners or anything, it's just that we've had so many of them over the years. \n(BEAT) Besides some of these are fish. \nTHE LIVING ROOM A tired looking man in his 50's eating a cookie. \nTIRED MAN Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to be musicals. As in Broadway musicals. Can you believe that? Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I got to do the Elora with Mookie Wilson. Miriam and I were at one last weekend at the Pierre; whole thing was like a winter wonderland... live penguins wearing yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out ten grand alone for some asshole to build a barricade of French garbage across the boccie lanes at my tennis club. THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on her lap. \nLARGE I was just thinking- \n(BEAT) I was just thinking you spend you're whole life lusting for anything you don't have. You stress over money and your career, you set your clocks back, you exercise, you wait in line, you paint your house, get depressed, feel better, buy things, take your clothes to the dry cleaner, set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail. Then you die and people are really sad, they cry really hard... \n(BEAT) and then they go eat lunch. Hetakes a bite of his bagel. \nCYNTHIA Oh please be a little more interesting than that. \n(MORE) \nPlease don't be the brooding guy. That's so unoriginal. I'd rather hold onto who I imagined you'd become. \nLARGE Miss me? \nCYNTHIA No. Me? \nLARGE No. \n(BEAT) She didn't like being alive. She got what she wanted. This should be a party. Instead we're supposed to mope. About what? She never did anything. \nCYNTHIA She made you. \nLARGE some trophy. I do have to say I'm impressed with the turnout. \nCYNTHIA What, you didn't think people would come? \nLARGE Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours? \nCYNTHIA No. Right now I'm alive, so I think about living. \nLARGE It's one way to determine who your friends are. The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend. But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country. \nCYNTHIA So where do I fall into that? \nLARGE You'd be there. \nCYNTHIA Oh you think so? \nLARGE I do. I think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had. But you've got too much pride to let me know that. You want to pout 'cause I don't return your calls. \nCYNTHIA you're way more talkative than I remember. \nLARGE Today I've been more talkative than I remember. \nCYNTHIA What about mine? \nLARGE Funeral? Honestly? I probably wouldn't travel for it- no. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a great turnout. \nCYNTHIA Why do you say that? \nLARGE 'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout. I think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech. \nCYNTHIA Are you implying that that's why I'm going to med school or something? \nLARGE I'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives. \nCYNTHIA It's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look good. \nLARGE Where do I sign up for not caring? \nCYNTHIA How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad? That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good. \nLARGE Wow, that was so clever how you did that. Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too? Med school's one thing, but please don't become him. \nCYNTHIA He's one of the most caring people I've ever met. \nLARGE well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had. Hell, you're the family he never had. Has he got you on Lithium yet? Wait till he does, you'll love him even more. He stands. \nCYNTHIA I bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message. I said after nine years, he's definitely coming home with a message. \nLARGE i looked for a message; I got bored and became an actor. He leaves. \nINT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nLARGE I'm not reading into this, I'm just thinking out loud so don't get \nUPSET- \nGIDEON What? No. \nLARGE What? \nGIDEON Its not that. \nLARGE I'm just saying did they check? I mean has someone ruled that out? \nGIDEON No. Because they know she drowned, Andrew. \nLARGE I'm just saying the facts. \nGIDEON No. \nLARGE And I suppose it doesn't even really matter. But I'd be curious to know. I would like to know if that's what happened; just for me. I mean would that surprise you? \nGIDEON No. Yee! \nLARGE She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy- \nGIDEON I know! Do you think I don't know?! \nLARGE And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before. \nGIDEON Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking mouth. Large is taken aback. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) \n(FIGHTING TEARS) If nothing else will you please just leave, her alone. She's gone. That's it. That's all you get. She died. We will never see her again. She tried very hard, but she just couldn't find it. She could never find it. And I think - I know that she's found it now. I know that. And I know there's a certain amount of guilt that you must feel for the way things unfolded, but it's too late now. \n(MORE) \nSo I'm asking you, for me, not to do that. Don't... come here and do that. \nLARGE I think I deserve to know the truth. \nGIDEON You want to make her crazy. Why? Does that make it easier for you? Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet and cries. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) It's like you want to torture yourself or something! Why would you want to think that? That that happened. Why would you ever want to think that? Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in his lap and his arms over his head. It takes everything Large has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the sink next to him. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) I just want everyone to be happy again. \n(BEAT) I dreamt last night that I had special powers. If I squeezed my eyes shut and clinched my fiats closed tight enough, we'd all wake up in paradise. (with a laugh through \nTEARS) I was like a superhero... and that was my power. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nA giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave- Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each other. Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave. \nMARK How could you leave all that Lithium? I was totally gonna hit you up for some. \nFB \nJESSE This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're back, man, because this town is so messed up. Everyone's got there drug of choice like in \"Brave New World\". Did you ever read that book? Who wrote that? Aldous something. Aldous- \nLARGE I don't know. Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED \nNONSENSE AS SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse. \nMARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and looks away. \nREGULAR MOTION: \nJESSE (O.S.) .and people are just like that here, man. Huxtable3 Aldous Huxtable. That's it. \nINT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nSam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder. \nOLIVIA Andrew would you like to see Sam's ice skating tape? \nSAM Okay, good-night. (calling to Titembay) Night, Tim. \nLARGE Good-Night. \nTITEMBAY (0.5.) Rolla! \nINT. BAR -- NIGHT \nSam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng pints. They're buzzed. \nLARGE It was the only thing I ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else. \n(BEAT) But I've been so out of it the only parts I ever get offered are to play handicapped people. \nShe tries to hold it together, but she bursts out laughing. \nLARGE (CONT'D) It's not funny. \nSAM Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like. \nLARGE So what should we laugh at you about? \nSAM I lied again. I have epilepsy. \nLARGE Which part are we laughing about? \nSAM I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said their insurance would only cover me if I wore \"preventative covering\". \nLARGE Preventative covering? \nSAM The helmet I was carrying. Large is silent. \nSAM (CONT' D) Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the only person in the world wearing a helmet to work who isn't putting out fires or racing for NASCAR. But what do you do? I can't quit; their insurance is amazing. What can you do? You laugh. I'm not saying I don't cry a lot, but in between I laugh and realize how silly taking anything very seriously is. And plus, I look forward to a good cry. I just love the way it feels. \nLARGE I haven't cried since I was a little kid. I didn't cry at my mother's funeral. I wanted to- \n(A SMILE) I... tried. I thought of all the saddest things I could think of; things in movies, this image from Life magazine that haunts me... nothing came. \n(MORE) \nThat actually made me sadder than anything; the fact that I felt no numb. \nSAM What do you mean? \nMARK (O. S.) Vagina! \nLARGE Oh, no. Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others. \nLARGE \"(CONT'D) Hey, guys, this is Sam. This is Mark, Dave and you met Jesse. \nMARK Hey. Nice to meet you. \nJESSE Hey. \nDAVE T'sup. \nMARK I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you. \nSAM It's okay. \nMARK Nice. Let's get fucked up. Off Large's smile we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT \nA palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion. The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance. Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of the pool. \nMARK One, two, three! Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He stands there staring at the water. \nSAM Hey! what are you doing? \nDAVE Largeman, get the fuck in the pool. \nGIRL oh, it's so warm! \nSAM Can you swim? \nJESSE You're like a little detective. \nLARGE I know. You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van. \nSAM Am I being too nosey? \nLARGE No. No. I just... it's fine.. I just haven't ever really talked about it. \nJESSE To be honest, I never really knew either. I mean I heard stories. \nLARGE You wanna know? \nSAM Yeah. \nLARGE Really, really? \nMARK You're gay. \nLARGE No. Drumroll... I was the reason she was in a wheelchair. \n(BEAT) I pushed her. \n(MORE) \n(BEAT) So there that is. \nSAM Shut up. \nMARX Fuck you. \nLARGE No, it's the truth. \nSAM Why? \nLARGE It was a complete freak accident. I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was. I... Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet. \nLARGE (CONT'D) Look at her face.. That's how, she. was every single day of her life. And one day... I was nine years old and I just really hated, her for that, and I pushed her. \n(BEAT) I mean it was innocent. I was just frustrated 'cause... \nSAM You couldn't make her happy. \nLARGE Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open. The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open. That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic. So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down. Sam's eyes are wide in shock. \nSAM Oh my God. \nE \nLARGE Still want to compare fucked up families? \nJESSE But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left. \nLARGE Well I was nine. They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to \"curb my anger\". And I've been on some form of them ever since. My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia. And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in. So he sent me to boarding school. And I haven't been home since. \nSAM Until now. \nMARK For her funeral. \nLARGE Until now for her funeral. I'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh? Next time through I think I'll lay low out of the gate. He takes a sip of his beer. \nLARGE (CONT ' D) The thing is though, when I think about it, I wasn't really abnormally angry at all. I mean it all happened so quickly; I got prescribed all these drugs for anxiety and depression and anger so I just kind of became what they are. \nSAM It sounds like a punishment. \nLARGE I think it was. So I left them in LA. I'm taking myself off punishment. \nMARK Please don't remind me. \nJESSE All he heard of that whole story was \"left drugs in LA\". \nMARK Fuck you. \nJESSE Crackhead. A 19 year old girl from the pool comes around the corner \nDRIPPING WET_ \nGIRL Mark? Where's the sauna? Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way. Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire. \nMARK Jesse cooked his. They both laugh. \nLARGE Why's it brown? \nMARK 'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin. \nLARGE Oh. Large laughs at Mark's earnestness. \nLARGE (CONT'D) You kept her little blue skirt on. \nMARK He's a boy. His name's Shantel. \nLARGE It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt. \nMARK They're shorts. \nLARGE Shorts? \nMARK Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're shorts. \nLARGE Oh. They laugh. Large flips through an album. \nLARGE (CONT'D) You collect \"Desert Storm Trading Cards\"? \nMARK Fuck yeah, dude. Those are collectors items. Do you have any idea how much those things will be worth some day. \nLARGE Really? \nMARK Hell yeah. That shit's like an investment. I have lots of little investments - all over the place. I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and just live off 'em. \nLARGE So like how much is this one worth? \nMARK Which? \nLARGE \"Night Vision Goggles.\" \nMARK I don't know. Mint; maybe two, three. \nLARGE Dollars? \nMARK Yeah. But it's too early. You don't sell'em yet. Don't you know anything about investing. I'm gonna live off that shit. That \"Schwarzkopf\" card is worth at least five something. And if you have the complete set it's worth like thousands. \nLARGE So do you have the complete set? \nMARK Almost. The corners are bent on my \"Friendly Fire\" and someone stole my \"Wolf Blitzer\". \nLARGE Someone stole it? \nMARK One of my Mom's Medieval Times friends, man. Drug addicts. \nLARGE For drugs they sold it? \nMARK Yeah. \nLARGE Wolf Blitzer. \nMARK It doesn't matter if you're a rich house wife looking for your muscle relaxers or some crack head drying cars: people will do anything in this town to get their drug money. Now look, what do you gotta do today? I gotta little going away present for you. But I kinds gotta track it down. So, can you give me a ride? \nLARGE Yeah, sure I just... \nMARK What? \nLARGE Nothing I just... \nMARK Say it... speak. \nLARGE Nothing I just, I told Sam I was gonna hang out with her today... \nMARK She can come, I don't care. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREETS- DAY \nGREAT MUSIC PLAYS. They drive the motorcycle through the Jersey suburbs; Sate on the back and Mark in the sidecar wearing a lacrosse helmet and ski goggles. LARGE'S POV: A mother and her stroller. A huge group of Black teenagers coming home from school. An old crossing guard. An ambulance. Two powerwalkere. \nOMIT \nINT. HANDI-WORLD - LATER \nEXT. 1CTERNIAN'S QUARRY -- LATER \nFurther down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop handle he's found as a walking stick. As they continue along the path it begins to get continually cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub, remnants of a \"Jungle-Gym\", dirty broken toys. Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm and welcoming. Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he expected. Rain begins to fall. \nMARK I guess this is it. \nLARGE So... knock. Knock and barter for \"Dessert Storm Trading Cards\". \nMARY Please don't tease me about my hobbies. I don't tease you about being an asshole. They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull. \nAfter a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid- thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears on the deck. He smiles warmly- \nALBERT (in a whisper) Mark? \nMARK Yeah. Are you Albert? \nALBERT (with a smile) Yes. Come on in out of the rain. Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A- frame ladder that sits next to the hull. \nINT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS \nThey step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM with deep cushy couches. \nALBERT You guys must be freezing. Make yourselves warm by the fire. I'm just gonna go put her down. I'll be right out. The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet whispers. \nSAM I must say, I've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder. \nMARK What do you mean, this is nice. \nLARGE ah nothing, just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark. \nMARK It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did you see that cliff? Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties. \nALBERT This is my wife, Faye. \nALL Hi. Hello. \nFAYE Hi. Welcome. \nALBERT This is Mark and Sam and Large, right? \nMARK \nYEAH_ \nALBERT Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves comfortable. \nFAYE Its really coming down out there, huh? \nLARGE Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden. \nALBERT Well in a bad storm I like to pretend this old boat's my own private \"ark\". Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse, I'm not quite sure it still floats. \nFAYE Would any of you like some tea? \nSAM I'd love some tea. Large and Mark look at her. \nLARGE No thanks. \nMARX No.. thanks. Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely nodding at each other. \nLARGE What is it that you do here? What is this place? \nALBERT Good question. We're calling it Kiernan's Fault. And no one's really quite sure what it is because they haven't been able to explore it. They're locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land. \n(MORE) \nSo one of these days it will either be a national park or a shopping mall. But while their locked in litigation, I was hired to make sure no one comes inside. \nLARGE Oh. Wow. \nALBERT What they don't know is that I'm a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby. So, at night... I go down. \nFAYE He's documenting it to support their case. \nSAM Wow. So how deep does it go? \nALBERT No one really knows. I've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down. But I like to pretend it's infinite. \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE -- LATER \nThe rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar. \nLARGE So I don't know if I'm gonna see you. \nMARK I know. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag? \nLARGE To be honest, I don't even care anymore. Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand. \nMARK I'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along. \n(BEAT) But I got it back. That's got to be worth something, right? \nLARGE This whole day was about this? \nMARK \n(NODDING) And anyway you didn't want it down there with her. It's better for you to have it. Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still wearing his garbage bag parka. \nMARK (CONT'D) Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me. Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He stares at the pendant in his hand. \nSAM What is it? \nLARGE It's my Mom's favorite necklace. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nThey sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other. Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the pendant... EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three separate indentations. \nLARGE No. I don't want to play this game. \nSAM Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all. All the things you never got a chance to say. \n(BEAT) No? \nI (BEAT) Well I don't want to push you. I just thought it might help. I mean isn't that what you came home for? Re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath. \nLARGE Okay. \n(BEAT) I would... \n(BEAT) If she were sitting here. \n(REALLY THINKING) \n(MORE) \nif my mother were sitting here I would tell her... Silence. The faucet DRIPS behind him. \nSAM What? \nLARGE I really don't wanna... \n(BEAT) I would tell her that I'm sorry. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry that she wasn't happy. And I'm sorry I couldn't make her happy. And you know if I could have had anything I ever wanted to have happen in my life actually ever happen, it would have been that she would be happy. And... A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over. \nSAM Oh, my God, Large I think I see one. \nLARGE Shut-up. \nSAM Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup. \nSAM (COUT' D) Here don't move, I'm gonna get it. She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like a child capturing an inch worm. \nLARGE I guess I could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook. They wait. \nSAM Is that it? \nLARGE I think so. I don't feel any more coming. \nSAM Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay? \nLARGE Yeah. \nLARGE Safe. \n(BEAT) When I'm with you, I feel so safe... like I'm Rome. A WIDE SHOT of the bathroom as Sam and Large embrace in the middle of the empty tub and the faucet continuee to DRIP. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LARGE'S BEDROOM -- LATER \nLarge's STEREO PLAYS: (\"I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You\" by Colin Ray) Large and Sam lie naked in each other's arms. She's asleep. He lies wide awake resting his cheek on top of here. A SERIES OF DISSOLVES: of Large as he lies awake in different positions staring at the ceiling; processing. S am turns to him. He gets up out of bed and puts his clothes on. \nTNT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS Large stands at the end of the bed staring at Gideon lying propped up with a book on his cheat, asleep. The EVENING NEWS is on the TV. \nLARGE Dad? He sits up startled. \nGIDEON Oh, hey, hey c'mon in. He finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to turn off the TV. \nLARGE Sorry to wake you. \nGIDEON No, no, it's uh... I was just reading. \nLARGE I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days. \nGIDEON You've been avoiding me. \nLARGE No, I just... maybe I have been. \nGIDEON I'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about, but what I don't understand is why you're so angry at me. All I ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again, Andrew. That's all I ever wanted. \nLARGE But when were we ever all happy, Dad? I mean you always say that, but when was that? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to? 'Cause I don't have it in my memory. Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there. But we should... \n(BEAT) You know... you and I need to work on being okay if that's not in the cards for us. \nGIDEON Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did. \nLARGE What I did? What I did?! You know what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself for what I did right now: I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch. That's what I think now. And I'm not gonna... I mean I'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore. Because they've left me completely numb. I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life. And for that; I'm here to forgive you. Gideon site up against the headboard. \nLARGE (CONT'D) You've always said you wanted us to have whatever it is we wanted. Well maybe what Mom wanted more than anything, was for it to all be over. And for me, what I really want more than anything, is for it to be okay with you for me to feel something again; even if it's pain. \nGIDEON Going against your doctor's recommendation; that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on don't you think? \nLARGE (with a chuckle) This is my life, Dad. This is it. I've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start. So no, I don't think it's too much to take on. Because it's everything there is. \n(BEAT) I see now it's all there is. \nGIDEON Perhaps the great tragedy of my life, will be that you both deserved more than I knew how to give? \nLARGE We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than us. Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest. \nLARGE (CONT'D) You and I are gonna be okay. You know that, right? \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nWe may not be as happy as you always hoped we'd be. But for the first time let's allow ourselves to be whatever it is that we are... and that'll be better. OK? I think that'll be better. \nDISSOLVE TO, \nINT. NEWARK AIRPORT STAIRCASE -- MORNING \nLarge sits next to Sam on a staircase between two escalators. \nSAM What are you doing? \nLARGE I don't want to hurt you. \nSAM No. Why? How can you... how could you... What's going on? What happened? We can figure out the long distance thing. Don't... this is a good thing, Large. Don't... you're gonna be... please don't do this.

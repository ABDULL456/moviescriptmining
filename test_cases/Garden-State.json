HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nLarge flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper, towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same pattern. He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his head to the right and stares at his body. He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his head and forearms are floating in mid-air. Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in mid-air. \nTNT. GIDEON'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS GIDEON LARGENAN sits alone at his desk. Large enters. \nLARGE Hi. \nG IDEON \nHELLO- \nLARGE How you doin'? \nGIDEON \"Well besides that tire. Lincoln, how was the show?\" \nLARGE You know I'm not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry. \nGIDEON Mmnn. \n(BEAT) Did you see Cynthia? \nLARGE From afar at the cemetery. \nGIDEON She's on call tonight; she volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue Squad. She's doing so well in med school. \nLARGE Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really happy that everything's working out so well for her. She deserves that. \nGIDEON I have very fond memories of the two of you running around here when you were little kids like brother and sister. Silence. \nGIDEON (CONT'D) So how are you? \nLARGE I'm okay. \n(SEARCHING) I've been getting these pretty bad headaches lately. It feels like a quick little lightning storm in my brain and then it's gone. I was thinking maybe you could set me up to get it checked out while I'm here. \nGIDEON Go see Dr. Cohen first thing tomorrow morning. Re's a neurologist in my building. I'll call him and he'll fit you in. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Silence. Large nods. \nLARGE House looks great. \nGIDEON Oh? That's nice. We've been... doing a lot of work on it. \nLARGE Really? \nGTDEON Actually, no. I don't know why I just said that. We haven't done anything to it. \n(BEAT) We cleaned it for this; for this whole thing. Janice has been cleaning. \nLARGE The bathroom in the hall. I noticed someone redid that. \nGIDEON Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this whole thing together out there. I think there's enough food out there for... everybody. I mean, more.than everybody... there's a lot of food out there. \nLARGE okay. I think I'll go have some.. \nGIDEON There's dessert too. \nLARGE Great. Okay. \nGIDEON Cake or something. \nLARGE Great. Large starts to leave. \nGIDEON I'm glad you're here. Large stops in the doorway. \nGIDEON (CONT'D} Saying goodbye is important. I'm glad you could... fit it in. They nod at each other.

Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to mean anything and then \nA PICTURE Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous \"chicken- foot\" slippers and smile from ear to ear. Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not yet requiring a wheelchair. He crosses to the bed and sits down.

THE GARAGE - NIGHT \nLarge pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and holds the idea of a smile. \nMUSIC CUE: \"REMY ZERO\" \nEXT. STREETS NIGHT \nLarge flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE \nMUSIC BLASTS. The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS FLASH behind him as he pulls over. \nLARGE Fuck. The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search light. \nCOP Hands on your head, please! \nLARGE What? \nCOP I said PUT YOUR MOTRERFUCKING HANDS \nON YOUR FUCKING HEAD PLEASE!21 Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red colors. \nCOP (CONT'D) Eighty-two in a twenty-five.

And it's really cool though, man. People really listen to you. They have to. And check this shit out. He pulls his gun out of his holster to show Large. \nKENNY (CONT'D) \n(POINTING) That's the safety. Plus the benefits; if I get shot I'm rich. \nLARGE Yeah but, I mean... Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were blowing coke lines off the top of a urinal. \nKENNY I had to grow up now, man, I wasn't makin' shit at the fish market. No one knew who I was. I couldn't get laid. This is a much better situation for me.

As they continue along the path it begins to get continually cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub, remnants of a \"Jungle-Gym\", dirty broken toys. Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm and welcoming. Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he expected. Rain begins to fall. \nMARK I guess this is it. \nLARGE So... knock. Knock and barter for \"Dessert Storm Trading Cards\". \nMARY Please don't tease me about my hobbies. I don't tease you about being an asshole. They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull. \nAfter a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid- thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears on the deck. He smiles warmly- \nALBERT (in a whisper) Mark? \nMARK Yeah. Are you Albert? \nALBERT (with a smile) Yes. Come on in out of the rain. Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A- frame ladder that sits next to the hull. \nINT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS \nThey step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM with deep cushy couches. \nALBERT You guys must be freezing. Make yourselves warm by the fire. I'm just gonna go put her down. I'll be right out. The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet whispers. \nSAM I must say, I've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder. \nMARK What do you mean, this is nice. \nLARGE ah nothing, just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark. \nMARK It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did you see that cliff? Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties. \nALBERT This is my wife, Faye. \nALL Hi. Hello. \nFAYE Hi. Welcome. \nALBERT This is Mark and Sam and Large, right? \nMARK \nYEAH_ \nALBERT Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves comfortable. \nFAYE Its really coming down out there, huh? \nLARGE Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden. \nALBERT Well in a bad storm I like to pretend this old boat's my own private \"ark\". Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse, I'm not quite sure it still floats. \nFAYE Would any of you like some tea? \nSAM I'd love some tea. Large and Mark look at her. \nLARGE No thanks. \nMARX No.. thanks. Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely nodding at each other. \nLARGE What is it that you do here? What is this place? \nALBERT Good question. We're calling it Kiernan's Fault. And no one's really quite sure what it is because they haven't been able to explore it. They're locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land. \n(MORE) \nSo one of these days it will either be a national park or a shopping mall. But while their locked in litigation, I was hired to make sure no one comes inside. \nLARGE Oh. Wow. \nALBERT What they don't know is that I'm a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby. So, at night... I go down. \nFAYE He's documenting it to support their case. \nSAM Wow. So how deep does it go? \nALBERT No one really knows. I've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down. But I like to pretend it's infinite. \n", "test2_true": "SAM It's kind of an odd job isn't it? Guardian of an infinite abyss? \nALBERT Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade and deal in antique jewelry. I suppose it's pretty odd for you that we live down here like this- \nSAM No. \nLARGE Not at all. \nMARK Never crossed my mind. \nALBERT But we think it's important. \nLARGE Why? What do you think you'll find? \nALBERT I don't know. It's exciting. New frontiers are hard to come by these days. I guess I just like the idea of discovering something. \n(MORE) \nDoing something completely unique that no one's ever done before. Large looks to Sam. \nLARGE Yeah. \"Albert's Abyss\". \nALBERT Who knows? Maybe. But I used to think that was all that mattered. No matter what it was, as long as I could put my name on it. Like it would somehow justify the fact that I lived; that I was here. \"I did that. That's mine. I got this plate on my travels.\" But you know what? That's all ego; none of that stuff really matters. If at the end of the day I get to be with her, if I get to be with this person right here and the baby we created, then that's all I need. Just having felt that... If I die in an hour, I know I've lived. Faye kisses his forehead. \nLARGE You know \"my whole life I've had that same anxiety that if I didn't discover something or... save something or... \nSAM Save something from being discovered. \nLARGE Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted my time here. And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it. \nALBERT Well I think that force would rather remind you that \"breathing's all it takes to be a miracle\". He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert; TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage. \nGREAT MUSIC BEGINS. \nALBERT Well i suppose you want what you came all the way down here for. \nMARX Yeah, that would be great. \nALBERT It took me awhile to track this piece down. But I owe Diego huge. He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head. \nMARK That's it. Thank you. They all stand. \nSAM Well thank you for the tea. \nLARGE Yeah, thanks. \nFAYE Okay, good luck in the rain. Would you like some garbage bags or something? \nLARGE Yeah, that would be great. \nEXT ALBERT'S HOUSE BOAT--DAY They open the door and venture into the, DOWN POUR in their garbage bag parkas. \nALBERT Good-bye. Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway. As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the path.

KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- CONTINUOUS \nTHE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half speed. Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base. REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss. Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to join hint. The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can, with everything they have in the POURING RAIN. FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect moment. UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her. They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 1348, "test3_input": "EXT.

Don't you wanna know what's in the bag? \nLARGE To be honest, I don't even care anymore. Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand. \nMARK I'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along. \n(BEAT) But I got it back. That's got to be worth something, right? \nLARGE This whole day was about this? \nMARK \n(NODDING) And anyway you didn't want it down there with her. It's better for you to have it. Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still wearing his garbage bag parka. \nMARK (CONT'D) Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me. Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He stares at the pendant in his hand. \nSAM What is it? \nLARGE It's my Mom's favorite necklace. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nThey sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other. Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the pendant... EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three separate indentations. \nLARGE No. I don't want to play this game. \nSAM Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all. All the things you never got a chance to say. \n(BEAT) No? \nI (BEAT) Well I don't want to push you.

And I'm sorry I couldn't make her happy. And you know if I could have had anything I ever wanted to have happen in my life actually ever happen, it would have been that she would be happy. And... A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over. \nSAM Oh, my God, Large I think I see one. \nLARGE Shut-up. \nSAM Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup. \nSAM (COUT' D) Here don't move, I'm gonna get it. She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like a child capturing an inch worm. \nLARGE I guess I could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.

I don't feel any more coming. \nSAM Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay? \nLARGE Yeah. \n", "test3_true": "LARGE It's funny; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother. Its so weird, I haven't thought about this in so long, but this great memory I have where I was a little kid and I was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth. And I could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth. And there was just snot dripping down my nose. \n(HE LAUGHS) And she just handed me her sleeve and told me to just blow my nose into it. And I remember thinking, even as a very little kid, \"Wow. This is love.\" More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant. \nLARGE (CONT'D) This is love. And it just felt so... good to be there. So safe. And I didn't feel safe very often, but at that moment... Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She holds the plastic cup in her hand. \nSAM oh, Large I'm never gonna be able to get all these. They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks. \nSAM (CONT'D) I'm never gonna be able to get all these, am I? \nLARGE It's so funny isn't it? But I think that's the single most amazing moment I remember of my Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and she wasn't being prodded to be happy, she was just there. \nSAM To be your Mom. \nHe node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost looks like a different person. They stare directly into each other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for him. \nSAM (CONT'D) Look at me. \n(BEAT) Look at me. He does. And we see a vulnerable, lonely, little boy. \nSAM (CONT'D) (in a whisper) Let go. Listen to me. Just don't hang onto any of it anymore.

He cries with his elbow over his eyes. \nSAM (CONT'D) What do you feel? Describe it. That always helps me. My mom always says, \"What's the word that's burning in your chest...\" She touches his chest with her hand. \nSAM (CONT'D) What is it? He looks away. Soared. \nSAM (CONT'D) Look at me.

I feel like I just get so much thrown at me; like there's so much speeding by me in a day that I feel like if I look up from the sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall down. So it's like I just... barrel through and don't look up, so I'll just never fall, you know? And that's really... and you know it's so sad to say this, but that's really how I've been living my whole life. \nSAM Trying to barrel through. \nLARGE Yeah. \nSAM Well it sounds like you were due to fall. \nLARGE Yeah. \n(REALIZING) Yeah I was. (beat. Then with a laugh.) Thanks Mom. (beat, realizing) That's funny. The definition's always confused me, but I'm pretty sure that's irony. He smiles. He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve . \nLARGE (CONT'D) Come here. She comes in for a tight embrace.

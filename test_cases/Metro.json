{"train": "\"METRO\" \nScreenplay by \nRandy Feldman \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nCLOSEUP OF SCOTT ROPER \nHe's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's into it. \nTRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing... \nROPER Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... \nThe CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge. HELICOPTER SHOTS give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline. \nTRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by half a length... Backtrack closing... \nINT. CAR - DAY \nRoper's police radio SQUAWKS. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) One-one-four to Roper. \nHe picks up the radio. \nROPER Dig in, Cozy Girl... (into the radio) Roper go. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and Grand. \nTRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack... \nROPER I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. \nHe tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator. \nROPER Stay up there, Girl... \nTRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head... \nEXT. TRANS AM - DAY \nWeaving through traffic on the bridge. \nROPER (V.O.) Where's the damn wire?! \nTRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second. \nROPER (V.O.) SHIT! \nThe Trans Am streak off toward the city. \nEXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY \nA hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, weaves through the spectators and past the barriers. \nA FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him. \nKIMURA Hi, Roper. \nROPER Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post? \nKimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him... \nKIMURA The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for... \nROPER ...a car. \nKIMURA That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't... \nROPER ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... \nKIMURA That's right. \nROPER What's the suspect's name? \nKIMURA Earl. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nAcross from the bank. This is where the \"command post\" is setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper saunters in. \nROPER Hello, guys. \nBAFFERT Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us. \nRoper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing. \nROPER Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl? \nBaffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it. \nBAFFERT This guy is no genius. \nRoper scans the profile. \nROPER They're not usually graduate students. \nBAFFERT SWAT wants to go in. \nROPER What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week? \nRoper refers to the folder. \nRoper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger. \nROPER Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out. \nEarl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation. \nEARL What are my chances of getting out of here? \nRoper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying. \nROPER Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City... \nRoper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard. \nROPER How ya doin'? \nThe guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces. \nROPER (to Earl) ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway. \nEarl is encouraged by that. \nEARL Really? \nROPER Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. \nRoper looks directly into Earl's eyes. \nROPER He didn't kill anybody, though. \nRoper bends over the guard. \nROPER This is gonna hurt. \nHe grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously. \nEARL Hey, leave him alone. What are you doing? \nRoper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door. \nROPER It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing. \nEarl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. He lets Roper drag the guard to the door. \nROPER I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie. \nEarl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nRoper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of them is Jennings. \nROPER (whispering to Jennings) Give me your gun. \n(NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest. \nROPER I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years. \nJENNINGS Why not keep the streak alive? \nROPER Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nEarl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's back. He's getting very agitated. \nEARL (yelling) HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE! \nThe two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from Earl. \nROPER As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith. \nRoper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave. \nROPER Give me Debbie. \nEarl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head. \nEARL Take the old guy. \nThe other hostages watch this exchange tensely. \nROPER The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie. \nEARL Am I gettin' the car? \nROPER You're gettin' the car. \nEarl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter. \nEARL Take them. \nRoper decides that this is the best he's going to get. \nROPER You two, leave. \nThe two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump up and rush out the front door. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - DAY \nMcCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops. \nFORBES This guy is good. \nMCCALL That's what they say. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nBaffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his pocket. \nBAFFERT Floor seats. \nROPER You're my hero. \nBAFFERT Dinner's on you. \nROPER Deal. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING \nA quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. He goes into the Captain's office. \nINT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING \nCAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down. \nSOLIS He just walked into my office. (looks over at Roper) The Chief says, \"Good work this morning. Congratulations.\" \nRoper smiles as he sits down. \nROPER Tell him to give me a raise. \nSOLIS (into the phone) He says, \"Thank you very much.\" (a beat) I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief. \nSolis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. He knows he's got leverage. \nSOLIS Roper. \nROPER What? \nSOLIS Are you going to make this hard for me? \nROPER Depends. What's up? \nSOLIS There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up. \nROPER Define concern. \nSolis dumps his cards on the table. \nSOLIS What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it? \nROPER Your concern is heartwarming. \nSOLIS It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you. \nROPER Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? \nSOLIS His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed. \nRoper grabs McCall's folder off the desk. \nROPER Let me see that. \nRoper scans it. \nROPER Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation. \nINT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING \nMcCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear their voices. \nINT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING \nROPER \"Additional Skills\": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish... \nRoper throws the folder back on the desk. \nROPER Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. \nSOLIS You let us worry about that. \nROPER Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation? \nSOLIS (gloomily) What kind of appreciation are we talking about? \nROPER The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... \nSOLIS What do you think would be in order? \nROPER Like ahh... I don't know... (boldly) Five thousand dollars. \nSOLIS (calmly) Okay, I think I could swing that. \nUh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short. \nROPER (quickly) And a car. \nSOLIS Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own. \nROPER You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound. \nSOLIS Impound isn't a rent-a-car company. \nROPER (firmly) The car is part of the deal. \nSOLIS What happened to your Trans Am? \nSolis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come in. \nROPER Repoed this morning. \nSOLIS (relenting) I'll provide you with transportation. \nROPER And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background... \nBAFFERT Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things. \nRoper bends over like an old man. \nROPER Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up. \nThey arrive at their destination. A parking space with a 1957 DODGE PICKUP. \nBAFFERT This is it. Space 742. \nRoper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief. \nROPER Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right. \nBaffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who is crossing to the truck. \nROPER Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this. \nHe takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the passengers side. He opens the door. \nBAFFERT Where's the stereo? \nROPER Fuck the stereo. What's that smell? \nBAFFERT Come on. Just get in. We gotta go. \nEXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT \nThe pickup in traffic. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. KORDA'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nIt's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now. The pickup pulls to a stop out front. \nINT. PICKUP - NIGHT \nBaffert pulls out a slip of paper. \nBAFFERT Apartment 306. \nROPER You want me to go up with you? \nBAFFERT Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him. \nROPER Good. I don't want to be late. \nBaffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone. \nROPER You want anything on the game? \nBaffert turns back around. \nBAFFERT What's the line? \nROPER It was Warriors plus 6 this morning. \nBAFFERT I'll take half of your action. \nBaffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular phone. Beep! Beep! \nDETAIL SHOT \nA message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY. \nRoper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He gets out of the truck and crosses to it. \nINT. BUILDING - NIGHT \nThird floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up. Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks. \nINT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT \nJazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door. \nKORDA Who is it? \nBAFFERT (V.O.) It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department. \nA slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door. \nKORDA What happened? Is there a problem? \nBAFFERT May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions. \nKorda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the music. A smile grows on his face. \nBAFFERT Count Basie? \nKorda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada. \nKORDA Duke Ellington. \"Things Ain't What They Used To Be\", recorded July 30, \nBAFFERT Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it. \nKorda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays low. \nBAFFERT Where did you find an old recording like that? \nKORDA Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. (searching for the name) Memories... Memory Lane or something... \nBAFFERT I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci? \nKORDA You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street? \nINT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT \nRoper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door. Roper races out. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRoper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it open. Gun aimed. \nINT. APT. 302 - NIGHT \nA five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves. \nEXT. BUILDING - NIGHT \nRoper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches. \nINT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN \nAngle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone. \nSOLIS (on the phone) Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him. \nSolis hangs up the phone. \nSOLIS The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. \nROPER (still looking out window) He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... (beat; turning to Solis) I want to be put on this case. \nSOLIS I can't do that. \nROPER (emphatic) I want to be put on this case. \nSOLIS You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it. \nROPER Who's running it? \nSOLIS Roper... \nROPER Who's running it! \nSOLIS Kimura and Glass will head the investigation. \nRoper turns to leave. \nSOLIS Scott. Go home. Get some sleep. \nRoper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT \nTwo detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming. \nROPER Hey, hey, hey... \nRoper intercepts them. \nROPER Anything on Korda so far? \nKIMURA Solis said to keep you clear of this. \nRoper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward Solis' hallway. \nROPER I don't give a damn what Solis said. (to the detectives) If you get a lead, I want to know. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING \nRoper's pickup drives by. \nINT. PICKUP \nThru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost. \nINT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRoper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard. \nRONNIE (O.S.) Just a minute. \nRoper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings. \nRONNIE Hey. \nROPER Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. \nRONNIE (like hell) A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. (smells his breath) Jack Daniels? \nROPER I'm not drunk. Yet. \nRONNIE Maybe you should be. \nROPER You heard. \nShe nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway. \nRONNIE Yeah. I'm sorry. \nROPER Can I come in? \nRonnie opens the door reluctantly. \nINT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nClarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay. \nKORDA God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now. \nCLARENCE I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town. \nKORDA Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... (a beat) They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want. \nClarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add up in his head. \nCLARENCE Did you kill him, Mike? \nKorda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper again. \nCLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry... \nWe're talking major fear here... \nKorda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against his chest. \nKORDA It's not your fault you're stupid. \nTears of relief from Clarence. \nINT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nRoper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling. \nA couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, reading a book entitled, \"Strategies and Counter Measures in Hostage Situations\". On the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it. \nROPER (to Kimura and Glass) What do you got on Korda? \nKIMURA We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. \nROPER (rapid fire) Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? \nKIMURA Being faxed over now. \nROPER How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. \nKIMURA Roper... \nROPER And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. \nKIMURA Roper, we're into it... \nSuddenly Solis appears at their side. \nSOLIS We've had this conversation once, Roper. You're not active on this case. \nRoper looks at him icily. \nSOLIS It's in everyone's best interest. \nMcCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis heads back to this office. \nROPER (softened) You guys are doing good work. \nHe moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him coming. \nMCCALL I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be. \nROPER I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. \nMcCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda bottle. \nROPER I don't see much progress here. \nMcCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot from a nearby \"Mr. Coffee\" machine. It's filled with water. He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle. \nCLOSE ON THE BOTTLE \nThe pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle. \nROPER Very nice... You get an \"A\". Notice... No force required. No damage. \nJust then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom. \nSERGEANT Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street. Possible hostage situation. \nMcCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on \"Hostage Strategies\". He looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can. He and McCall head out. \nEXT. MARKET STREET - DAY \nThe pickup is weaving through traffic. \nINT. PICKUP - DAY \nStart on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble flashing on the dashboard. \nRoper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as ever. \nROPER So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco? \nMCCALL They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement. \nROPER Recruited you from where? \nMCCALL National Marksman Competition. \nROPER With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? \nMCCALL Furthest point I could find from New York. \nROPER You don't like New York? \nMCCALL Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while. \nholds it up so Raymond can see it. \nROPER Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? \nRAYMOND I ain't interested in your life story. \nROPER Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. \nRAYMOND She's the one to blame. Not me. \nEXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL \nIn prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope. \nPOV THROUGH SIGHT \nof Raymond's open window. \nINT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT \nEveryone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter sincerity. \nROPER Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. \nRAYMOND What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed. \nAnd now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not that coherent. \nRAYMOND I'm down at Consolidated and I'm begging. I'm saying I'll take half my pay. Eight years, man. I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore. I'll do maintenance. \"We're cutting back. We're streamlining, Ray. West Central's running things now. It's out of our hands\" Fuck them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM! (deep sigh) I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna live anymore. \nRoper reaches out to him. \nROPER Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. \nRAYMOND Doing what? Cleaning toilets? \nROPER I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. \nRAYMOND And why the fuck would you do that for me? \nROPER Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. \nRAYMOND Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa? \nROPER My name's Scott Roper. \nRay stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... Then... \nRAYMOND I need my coat. \nIt's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns and goes to get his coat. \nHe crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. The wife runs out of the room, screaming! \nROPER NOOOO!! \nHe rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds down the stairs... down another flight... \nEXT. APT. BLDG. \nMcCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his path. \nROPER WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? \nMcCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues into the building. \nINT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nRoper follows, screaming his head off. \nROPER Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head? \nMcCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow \"crime scene\" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under the tape. Roper follows. \nINT. APT. - DAY \nMcCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun \"Saturday night special\" variety. McCall looks up at Roper. \nMCCALL SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? I just saved a life. Yours. \nRoper doesn't miss a beat. \nROPER (still angry) You think I've never had a gun pulled on me?! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it?! \nMcCall gets to his feet. \nMCCALL Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide. \nROPER (fiercely) Not the ones I'm at. \nMcCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. McCall's face softens just perceptibly. \nMCCALL Sorry. My mistake. \nHe walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses the sheet over Ray's dead body. \nINT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT \nRoper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked \"Internal Affairs\". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the floor. Waiting. \nThe door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on the back. \nINVESTIGATOR Looks like a clean shoot. Go home and get some rest. \nMcCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled off considerably. Even a tad friendly. \nROPER Come on. Let's go for a drink. \nROPER First things is, don't say, \"What's going on?\" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, (addressing the mannequin) \"I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you.\" (turns back to McCall) Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that? \nMCCALL No. \nROPER It'll come. Try again. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately into... \nMCCALL My name's McCall. I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you. \nRoper's voice crackles back at him hostilely. \nROPER (V.O.) How are you going to help me? \nMcCall's confidence is growing. \nMCCALL Tell me what you need. \nROPER (V.O.) I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. \nNow he's stumped. \nMCCALL (hesitantly) I can't do that. \nROPER (V.O.) Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. \nMcCall looks up to his right. \nMCCALL Is all the name calling necessary. \nRoper re-enters the training area. \nROPER Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. \nMCCALL (exasperated) So what do I say to this guy? \nROPER You could say something like, (addressing the dummy) \"Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out.\" \nMCCALL What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off? \nRoper turns to McCall. \nROPER If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. \nMCCALL I'm not good at lying. \nROPER Get good at it. \nMCCALL It's against my nature. \nRoper gives him an amused smile. \nROPER You know the ten commandments? \nMCCALL Yes. \nROPER What's the first commandment? \nMCCALL Thou shall have no other God before me. \nThat's not the answer Roper wanted. \nROPER Okay, forget that. What's the main one. \nMcCall is tired of guessing. \nMCCALL You tell me. \nROPER Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right? \nMCCALL Yes. \nROPER Why? \nMCCALL To save lives. \nROPER So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives? \nMcCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back to the side door. \nROPER Let's try it again. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER \nMcCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the floor. \nMCCALL My name's McCall. I'm unarmed. \nROPER (V.O.) Okay, stop. \nRoper comes through the side door. \nROPER Close your eyes. \nMcCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper turns him away from the hostage scene. \nROPER What did you see? \nMCCALL (rapid-fire) A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine. \nMcCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed. \nROPER Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nMcCall sits like a wax figure. \nMCCALL (cynically) The 6 horse is still last. \nROPER He'll be running at the quarter pole. \nON THE TRACK \nThe horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses with every stride. \nROPER (V.O.) There he goes. \nIN THE STANDS \nMcCall sits forward slightly. \nMCCALL They need to run first and second? \nROPER Yeah, first and second. \nRoper gets to his feet. \nON THE TRACK \nThe horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in front and the SIX is coming on from behind. \nIN THE STANDS \nRoper is on his feet screaming. \nROPER Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell. \nMcCall jumps to this feet and joins him. \nMCCALL COME ON RUSSELL!... (to Roper) Who the fuck's Russell?! \nROPER The jockey! \nMCCALL COME ON, RUSSELL! \nRoper and McCall cheer together. \nON THE TRACK \nThe FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the wire and... It's too close to call. \nIN THE STANDS \nMcCall, really excited, turns to Roper. \nMCCALL We won! \nROPER (disheartened) We lost. \nMCCALL (confidently) We won. \nROPER How much you wanna bet? \nMCCALL You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick. \nANGLE ON TOTE BOARD \nAs the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 4-6-8. They won. \nIN THE STANDS \nROPER Yes! \nHigh fives. \nROPER That's eight hundred bucks. \nINT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY \nRoper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, not bad. McCall pockets his money. \nMCCALL How long you been coming here? \nROPER About six years. My partner took me. \nMCCALL Is it always like this? \nROPER Occasionally you lose. \nSuddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a cellular phone and dials. \nROPER (into the phone) Roper here. (he listens) I'm on my way. \nHe hangs up and turns to McCall. \nROPER We gotta go. \nEXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY \nMarble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation in full swing. \nINT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nIt's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's talking to the suspect. \nSOLIS We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nRoper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding. \nMCCALL This does not look good. \nThe Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested traffic of a side street. HONK-SCREECH! A Toyota swerves to miss it and broadsides a parked car. The Explorer fishtails off down the street. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nThe salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror. No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes speeding up behind... \nINT. CADILLAC - DAY \nRoper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead. Roper picks up the radio. \nMCCALL Suspect heading west on Sutter now passing Jones. Can we get an intercept? \nA voice comes back. \nVOICE (V.O.) R-32-David. We are proceeding south on Hyde. Will intercept. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nKorda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground. \nUP AHEAD \na squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn and heads up the hill. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThe Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit. \nTHE VAN \nhits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back down to the pavement. \nINT. VAN - DAY \nKorda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is beyond petrified. \nTHE CADILLAC \nreaches the top of the hill. Going fast. \nINT. CADILLAC \nAs it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the accelerator. No fear. \nVAN \nKorda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a hard left. \nTHE VAN \ncuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street... \nTHE CADILLAC \narrives at the intersection a few seconds later... Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through the corner. \nTHE VAN \nWrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the hill. \nTHE CADILIAC \nDown the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near collision with Korda... \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThe Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill. \nINT. VAN \nKorda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel \nTHE STREET \nThe van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car... \nBRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nKorda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a dizzying roll... \nTHE VAN \n...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. He heads toward it... \nINT. CABLE CAR \nAs Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the passengers view him uneasily. \nTHE CADILLAC \nhits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to see Korda leap onto the moving cable car. \nCABLE CAR \nother passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back... \nRoper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is making up ground on the cable car. \nKorda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a couple of shots at the Caddy. \nINT. CADILLAC \nA bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves. \nBACK ON THE CABLE CAR \nThat makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap off the cable car. \nPedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks through... \nTHE CABLE CAR \nRoper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall points ahead... \nROPER'S POV \nThe cable car. \nROPER \nLeaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it. \nANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR \nThe clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... Then disintegrates before our eyes. \nTHE CABLE CAR \nRoper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy... \nINT. CADDY \nHe lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the steering wheel hard right... \nEXT. STREET \nThe Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... But it's working. The cable car is slowing. \nBOTTOM OF STREET \nThe crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on them. General hysteria as they flee. \nTHE CABLE CAR \nKorda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs the satchel and bails out of the cable car... \nSTREET \n...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs into an underground garage. \nTHE CABLE CAR \nGrinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in astonishment. \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nRoper moves up an interior stairway, gun in \"ready\" position. He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the garage... Footsteps maybe. \nRoper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun... \nINT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE \nLots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans beneath the cars... No sign of Korda. \nRoper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward the window. \nA dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... Roper moves on. \nNEW ANGLE \nAs a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution. \nRoper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat. \nROPER Sorry, go. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nThe woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives off. \nINT. GARAGE \nRoper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might have escaped. \nHe heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield. \nThe car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it. \nGARAGE - 2ND LEVEL \nAs the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and piles into a parked car. \nKorda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck. \nRoper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between Korda's eyes. \nROPER Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here. \nKorda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't kill him in cold blood... \nWhat he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about those rules at this moment. \nROPER You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter. \nKorda stares past the barrel of the gun. \nKORDA I don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends. \nAnd that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night. \nHe yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing this guy. \nKORDA You can't kill me like this. \nROPER What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off? \nINT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe lovemaking is over. Roper is gazing at the ceiling, thinking. Ronnie is cuddled around him. A comfortable moment... \nROPER What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him? \nRONNIE It's okay. We broke up. \nROPER (surprised) When? \nRONNIE Just now. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY \nClarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass wall. He's edgy, fidgety. Clarence doesn't like to make visits to jail. \nKorda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard. Korda takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and picks up the receiver. Clarence picks up his receiver. \nCLARENCE How ya doin', man? \nKorda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the wall. \nKORDA You gotta do something for me... this fucker, Roper, he's gotta girlfriend. She works at the newspaper. I want you to take care of her. \nClarence is totally unnerved by this request. \nCLARENCE Hey, Michael, that's not my thing. \nKorda glares at him murderously. \nKORDA You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you. \nCLARENCE Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job. \nKORDA (exploding) Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!... \nKorda starts to draw the attention of the guard. He controls himself, lowers his voice. But the viciousness is still there. \nKORDA He held a gun to my head and said he should kill me right then... He made me... \nHe doesn't finish that thought. \nKORDA You do this for me Clarence. \nClarence is getting very upset. \nCLARENCE Don't make do it, Mike. \nKORDA Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail? \nCLARENCE I won't get away with it. \nKORDA Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery. \nClarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to have to do this. \nEXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA gray San Francisco evening. It starts to rain. \nINT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nShe's cooking some kind of sauce. She has a taste. \nEXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA subjective POV watching through the window as she moves around the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRonnie pours some oil in a pan. The phone RINGS. She crosses the kitchen to answer it. \nINT. PICKUP - NIGHT \nRoper on his cell phone. Paco is on the seat beside him. \nROPER Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner for some wine. \nRoper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper switch. \nINT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRONNIE How's Paco doing? \nINT. PICKUP - NIGHT \nROPER He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. \nPaco sits there panting. Roper pulls the pickup over in front of the store. \nINT. KITCHEN - STORE \nRONNIE Okay, dinner will be ready when you get here. \nShe hangs up. \nEXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThrough the window we watch her cross back to the stove. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nRonnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back on and leaves the kitchen. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRonnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the... \nDave listens to his head. \nWALTER He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me back in. \nMCCALL You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore. \nDave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes. \nDAVE Tell my dad. \nMCCALL Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? \nDAVE Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch. \nMCCALL I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now. \nDave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns to a frown: \nDAVE I hate fucking Springfield. \nMCCALL Is that where you're family lives? \nThen with sudden swiftness. \nDAVE I still hear them, man. You can't jam them. They've got the technology, man. They've got the satellites, Jack. They keep shooting beams off those satellites. What power do I have? \nDave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls. \nMCCALL NOOOO! \nWALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR \nfreefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nMcCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below. Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out to restrain. \nINT. LOBBY - DAY \nThe crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down the stairs. Roper moves toward him. \nROPER McCall! \nNo response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it up. \nROPER McCall! \nRoper races over and manages to jump in just as the car screeches away from the curb. \nBAY BRIDGE - DAY \nMcCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him for a beat. \nROPER Where are we going? \nINT. CAR - DAY \nMoving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign that says \"Golden Gate Racetrack.\" \nEXT. RACETRACK \nEstablish grand stands. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. BETTING AREA - DAY \nMcCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up against the window beside him. Watches. \nMCCALL Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta. \nTELLER The six is scratched. \nThis throws McCall for a beat. \nMCCALL Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta. \nThe teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of steps behind, giving him some space. \nEXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY \nMcCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper sits down next to him. \nEXT. TRACK - DAY \nThe horses go into the gate. \nEXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY \nMcCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call plays over the scene.) \nMCCALL Come on four horse! Come on Seven horse! \nRoper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly how he feels. \nMcCall is screaming his head off. \nMCCALL Come on four-seven... Come on... Come on... Come on... \nThe horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid- pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a shit about the race. He looks inconsolable. \nROPER Oh you thought I was going to ask you... \nRonnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed. \nROPER Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out... \nRoper picks up his menu and peruses it. \nROPER I assume you're having your usual -- the \"air dried venison\". \nINT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON \nThe wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through. \nINT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nAs the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see \nKORDA \npushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with his back to Korda. He's on the phone. \nKORDA Got another load. \nJAIL GUARD #3 Rack 'em up. (into the phone) Look, man, if it doesn't make it down here by five it's not my problem. \nAs the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing. \nKORDA All done. \nKorda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door. \nON THE GUARDS BACK \nWe hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door. \nCLOSE ANGLE \non the door sliding shut. \nON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE \nHold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the bags. \nANGLE ON KORDA \nhanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then down through an opening in the floor and into... \nINT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nas it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for another pair... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER \nKorda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera. \nKORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY \nA female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a door at the end of the hallway and into... \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS \nThe door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of metal. \nSlowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass. \nTRACKING - KORDA'S FEET \nstep by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick glass. \nCLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE \ntrying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then... \nA VOICE (O.S.) Hey! \nKorda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD (#1) moving toward him. \nTHE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA \nKORDA ...Yeah? \nThe guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand. \nJAIL GUARD #1 You dropped your card. \nKorda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman. \nJAIL GUARD #1 You guys are the scum of the earth. \nKORDA Just tryin' to make a living. \nKorda turns and walks out the door into... \nINT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIt's the final step before getting out of the building. A small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing with a LATINO GUARD. \nJAIL GUARD #2 I don't know what to tell you, mam, your brother ain't here. Try San Bruno. \nWOMAN I just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here! \nRoper untenses. Puts away his gun. \nROPER Korda escaped. \nRONNIE And you think he'll... \nHer voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too. \nROPER Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow. \nHe puts his arms around her waist. \nROPER Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff. \nShe puts her arms around his shoulders. \nRONNIE I don't think you're old and fat enough for me. \nROPER Use your imagination. \nEXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nANGLE looking up at her window... The light goes out. \nEXT. RONNIE'S DOORSTEP - DAY \nA suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed for a six month trip around the world. \nANGLE WIDENS \nMcCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck. \nMCCALL You sure you packed everything? Maybe you forgot your bowling ball. \nRonnie stands on the doorstep. \nRONNIE I sent that ahead, wise guy. \nPaco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper calls to Ronnie from the stairway. \nROPER (V.O.) Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. \nRONNIE I think I'll stand out here in the sun. \nINT. STAIRWAY - DAY \nRoper is still very edgy. \nROPER It's better if you stay inside. \nShe climbs up the stairs toward him. \nRONNIE You've got to calm down -- \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - SAME \nRoper reaches the top of the stairs. \nROPER Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. Time to get movin'. \nINT. RONNIE'S APT. - SAME \nRoper moves into the room, listening. There's no response. \nROPER (continuing) Ronnie? \nShe doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the living room. \nROPER (continuing) Ronnie, where are you? Time to go. \nNo answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking out the bathroom, bedroom... \nROPER (continuing) Ronnie. \nThen he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning... McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen. \nRoper's lowers the weapon... \nROPER (continuing) She's gone. \nMcCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry store. \nMCCALL (nodding) Scott... \nRoper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges, a momentary tremble in his hand. \nROPER That son of a bitch. If he... \nWe PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE. \nROPER (continuing; to himself) He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the speaker. \nKORDA (V.O.) (filtered) I got your lady, Roper. (laughs) \nRoper and McCall are listening closely to the tape. \nKORDA (V.O.) (continuing) You got something that belongs to me, and I want it back. (beat) Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty- eight, by the dry docks. (beat) I so much as smell another cop, I'll be sending you parts of this bitch for a month. \nRoper punches off the tape. \nKorda reacts in mock surprise. \nKORDA Oh, shit, in all the excitement I almost forgot. She right here... \nA LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's eyes in horror go to... \nRONNIE \nTied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed. \nRoper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes. \nROPER Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this. \nHe turns back, Korda grinning at him. \nKORDA No shit, this I gotta see... \nKorda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held down with TAPE. \nKorda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade. \n(PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie. \nKorda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it. \nWe can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point. \nKORDA (continuing) Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the switch. You see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut... \nHe releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting device. He stops it again, holding the button. \nKORDA (continuing; grins) Right in half. \nHe eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control box, holding the button down. \nEXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY \nThrough the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view. \nThe CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead. \nMCCALL Hold it right there... \nHis finger tightens on the trigger... \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nKorda holds the control box towards Roper. \nKORDA But then, that's not my problem. \nHe releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda grinning at Roper... \nEXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY \nThe RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead... \nMCCALL (O.S.) Light's out, fucker... \nAnd then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING on the back of his head. \nIn shock, McCall releases his finger... \nMCCALL Jesus! \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nRoper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button, stopping the lathe... \nKORDA You see, it's out of my hands. \nRoper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his hands... \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY \nThrough the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda. \nMCCALL Roper, move... \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nBut Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire. \nKORDA Well, hate to run but I've got a plane to catch. You take good care of the little lady, hear? \nAs Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly stops, turning, gesturing to the car. \nKORDA (continuing) How careless of me. You see, there's only one way out of here, and you're standing right in the way. (grins) You could move, but then... \nHe shakes his head at Roper. \nKORDA (continuing) Sure hate to be in your shoes. \nHe turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, to himself. \nRoper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button. \nEXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY \nHe can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else. \nMCCALL What the hell's going on? \nTHE LATHE \nThe blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper hauls her away, holding her in his arms. \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR \nKorda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE attached to the side of the building. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nRoper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning lathe. \nRONNIE Scottie, Scottie... \nROPER It's all over, babe, it's all over. \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nMcCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but... \nKORDA'S CAR \nKorda is not quite dead... \nThe door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall. \nHe OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as BULLETS hit the wall around him. \nMcCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE ensuing. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER \nHEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, keeping her low to the ground. \nROPER Stay here, don't move. \nRONNIE Scottie... \nROPER Do it! \nHe pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the cavernous, machine-choked building. \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL \nFIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, runs from his cover into the opening... \nKORDA \nLeaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and runs alongside the machine shop. \nROPER \nExits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping to his side. \nROPER McCall, you all right? \nMCCALL (in pain) I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building... \nROPER Stay put. \nRoper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the other end. Roper charges on... \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY \nKorda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner of the next building. \nKORDA \nClearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view. \nROPER \nWith the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand. \nKORDA \nSpeeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging on for dear life. \nROPER (shouting) Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake! \nKorda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him. \nROPER (continuing) Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass! \nKorda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY. He can't believe it, it's all fake! \nKORDA You fuck!!! \nKorda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on. \nKorda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles. \nThen Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the cab... \nROPER \nIn the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH. \nKORDA \nClears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS hysterically... he knocked him off! \nROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK \nLeaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching the dry dock area. \nIn the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, pinning it to the floor. \n", "test1_input": "KORDA In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no \"misunderstanding\". \nRoper is as serious as we've ever seen him. \nROPER I understand you completely. \nKorda disappears back behind the door. \nEXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nRoper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for his report. \nROPER (flatly) We're going to have to take this guy out. \nThat draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely says. \nSOLIS Can't we wear him down? \nRoper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis eyes it with dismay. \nROPER I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques. (a beat) So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out? \nMcCall calmly offers his opinion. \nMCCALL Let him come out. Too many unknowns in there. \nSolis nods. That'll be the plan. \nMCCALL When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb. (to SWAT Captain) Put our best man \"highground\", Twenty degree down angle. \nThe SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS. \nSWAT CAPTAIN Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line. \nThe underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at Roper dejectedly. \nSOLIS I feel this thing going sideways on us. \nRoper tries to buck him up. \nROPER There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages... (big pause) Yet. \nINT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nThe jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The guard and one of the jewelers. \nKorda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies. \nKORDA Drag them behind the counter. \nThe two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. Her eyes are a bit far away. \nKorda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction. \nWOMAN CUSTOMER I'm not staying here another minute. \nSALESGIRL #1 (panicky) No, Mrs. Dotson. \nKorda rushes around the display case. \nKORDA Come here, hag. \nHe grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a step toward Korda. \nMANAGER Leave her alone! \nKorda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager. \nKORDA You're a brave one, aren't you? \nThe manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks about making a run at him. \nSALESGIRL #2 (pleading) Sit down, Doug. \nA long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman. Korda looks down at her. \nKORDA If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, I'll have to kill her. \nKorda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted street. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY \nRoper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store. The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store. Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the barricade. \nROPER Okay. Time to give this fucker a call. \nRoper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching the store. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. BUILDING - SAME \nA sniper team watching the store from a third floor window. \nINT.

Waiting. \n", "test1_true": "And still another sharpshooter team. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME \nThe phone is still ringing. \nROPER This fucker's not answering. \nJust then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open. A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is discharging a fire extinguisher. \nMCCALL There's your answer. He's smart. \nROPER He's cutting down the visibility. \nMCCALL And doing a very good job of it. \nA thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone. \nMCCALL Come on. Give us one clean shot. \nSWAT CAPTAIN (into his radio) All positions, you have the green light. \nMCCALL They're out. \nRoper grabs a pair of binoculars. \nHIS POV \nThrough the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward the Explorer. \nMcCall watches intently. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - SAME \nA sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the trigger. \nANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE \nLow visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The sniper tries to lock him in. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER - ROPER'S POV - BINOCULARS - SAME \nThe figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes him instantly. \nROPER It's Korda. \nMcCall sees him now, too. \nMCCALL They switched clothes. \nRoper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio. \nROPER (urgently) Hold your fire! Hold your fire! \nToo late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes down, hit by the bullet. \nROPER Shit! Where'd that shot come from? Hold your fire! \nMore SHOTS ring out. \nDOWN ON THE STREET \nThe white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nRoper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages. \nMCCALL He's got the girl. \nROPER Damnit! \nAs Roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on Solis' desk. \nROPER (grabbing the keys; to Solis) Are these yours? \nSOLIS Yeah, they are but... \nROPER (to McCall) Come on! \nAs Roper and McCall move toward the door... \nSOLIS Roper, what are you going to do? Don't take my... \nAnd Roper and McCall are gone. \nSOLIS ...car. \nDOWN ON THE STREET \nPolice come rushing onto the street. Guns drawn. The Explorer ROARS off down the block. Roper and McCall burst out of the command center building, leap into Solis' Cadillac and tear off after the van. McCall is behind the wheel. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. POLICE BARRICADES - DAY \nThe Explorer comes barreling toward it. Spectators scatter. Two squad cars SCREECH up behind the barricades, trying to block Korda's escape. The Explorer PLOWS through the metal barricades. BASHES the squad cars out of the way. And screams off around the corner. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \n", "test1_id": 402, "test2_input": "ROPER Shut the fuck up! \nThe cabby immediately clams up. \nROPER Get on your radio and get the police here. \nRoper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY \nKorda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers on his face when he sees who's waiting for him. \nKORDA'S POV \nRoper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall. \nKORDA \nDons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his receiver as Roper picks up his. \nROPER If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed. \nKorda feigns total innocence. \nKORDA What in the world are you talking about, Mr. Roper? \nRoper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the glass. \nROPER Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner. \nKorda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His countenance is now a study in hate. \nKORDA I used to have an apartment, a car, jewelry. I had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch. Now look what I have. \nHe motions around. \nKORDA You're threatening me? You think I give a fuck? You think you can scare me off? (a laugh) Why don't you come in here and kick my ass? Get some of your guard friends in here to help. I'd like that. \nRoper glares at him mounting rage. \nKORDA (smirking) He really shook you up, didn't he?... I've got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you. Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality. \nRoper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless. \nKORDA You came here to threaten me? That's a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... Go ahead. Get down on your knees. \nRoper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against the plexiglass wall. \nROPER You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you! \nThe guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out. \nINT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY \nMcCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror. \nMCCALL I'm here to help you. \nNot quite right. He adjusts his stance. This time puts a little hand movement into it. \nMCCALL I'm here to help you. Talk to me. \nHe's still not satisfied. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY \nCaptain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking for McCall. \nSOLIS We got a situation at the V.A. Hospital. The responding officer has requested a negotiator. \nMCCALL Where's Roper? \nSOLIS He's on his way. Get over there. \nEXT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY \nA VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space. \nVET #1 (rambling incoherently) I can't fight this technology. They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments. I've seen those places. Everyone is dressed in white. It's like paper clothing, man. They're not even human. \nVet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very panicky. \nVET #2 Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me in. We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way. \nBut he's not getting through to his friend. \nVET #1 I can't help this, man. Do you have any idea what those microchips look like? How small they are when they put them in your brain? \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nLeading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER #4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees. \nOFFICER #4 When we got here, he was already doing his balancing act. I was talking to him, but it made him more agitated so I backed off. \nMCCALL Why is he up there? \nOFFICER #4 Something about a microchip in his brain. \nMCCALL Who is he? \nA NURSE answers him. \nNURSE HERRIN David Adler. He likes to be called Dave. The other guy is Walter Sinclair. \n", "test2_true": "VOICE (V.O.) Somebody help me out here. Somebody stop him. \nThe nurse turns to McCall. \nNURSE HERRIN What are you waiting for? \nMCCALL Another negotiator is on his way. \nNURSE HERRIN We can't wait for another negotiator. You have to do something. \nMCCALL What about the doctors? \nNURSE HERRIN He hates all the doctors. He says they're in on the conspiracy. \nVET #1 (O.S.) Where is everybody? He's going to kill me! \nMcCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nMcCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's heart jumps into his mouth. \nDAVE Get the fuck out of here! \nMcCall is tense and stiff. He stammers. \nMCCALL I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave. \nDAVE You can't help me, man. \nSo much for McCall's opener. Now what? \nWALTER He's high on something, man. Give him some thorazine or something. \nDave ignores Walter. \nDAVE No one can help me. They're controlling my mind. \nMcCall moves a couple steps closer. \nMCCALL Who's controlling your mind? \nDAVE Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that? \nMcCall fumbles for the right response. \nMCCALL This has nothing to do with Walter. \nDAVE They want Walter dead! \nEXT. STREET BELOW - DAY \nCops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nWalter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, eyes closed, praying. \nMCCALL Dave, look at me. \nDave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead. \nMCCALL Tell me what's wrong. \nDAVE Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me. \nMCCALL How can I help you with the particles? \nDAVE It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis. \nDave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then: \nMCCALL (blurting out) They have less power over you if you look into my eyes. \nDAVE Huh? \nMcCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. Dave turns back around. \nDAVE Huh? \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT \nRoper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN. \nROPER Whata ya got? \nFIREMAN Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair. \nROPER Can you get a net out here? \nFIREMAN Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nMcCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him. \nMCCALL We've been onto them for a long time. \nA glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit. \nMCCALL Let me show you something. \nNow he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his beeper. \nMCCALL See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. I'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore. Don't you feel that? You don't have to do what they say. \n", "test2_id": 403, "test3_input": "LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK \nMcCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around his waist and legs. \nKORDA (O.S.) All right, move it. \nMcCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the hot exhaust pipe. \nROPER \nReaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long. \nAt the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice. \nKORDA (O.S.) (continuing) Throw in and your piece. \nRoper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock. \nKORDA (O.S.) And your back up. \nRoper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it. Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence. \nKORDA (O.S.) (continuing) Walk under the cranes and down the alleyway. At the end, turn right.

ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY \nMcCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper, moving fast to keep him in sight. \nHe comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across a narrow RAMP to get to the next building. \nHe looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on, removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes. \nEXT. ROPER - DAY \nLeaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading: BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY \nMcCall negotiating another precarious crossing between buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it, across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper is now walking. He heads out. \nEXT. ROPER - DAY \nWalking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the roof tops of the buildings around him. \nROPER (to himself) Where the hell are you, McCall? \nAs Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from within: \nKORDA (O.S.) Right there, Roper. \nRoper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away. \nROPER Shit. \nRoper stops, slowly turning towards the doors. \nKORDA (O.S.) Come on in, there's someone just dying to see you. \nRoper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching. \nROPER (loudly) Where are you? \nEXT.

Get your ass in here, Roper. \nJust as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind him. Roper moves inside. \nMCCALL - DAY \nLying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE, looking through the scope. \nTELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the room cast in HARD SHADOWS. \nHe MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now just inside. \nMCCALL Stay cool, real easy... \nINT.

Open the bag, dump everything on the table. \nRoper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on its side, the bottom facing Roper.

He starts to toss the envelope in his fingers... \nKORDA (O.S.) (continuing) Not that one. \nRoper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving over the pile... \nROPER (continuing) Right there, the one in front... yeah, that one.

MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nKorda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL. \nKORDA Fill it up. Just in case there's a homing device in the other one. \nRoper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45 on the bottom of the satchel. \nKORDA (continuing) Now bring it over here. \nRoper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for time, he moves forward... \nEXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY TELESCOPIC SCOPE \nWatching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the gun. \nMCCALL Oh, shit... \nHe moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow cast on the floor, still unable to see him. \nMCCALL (continuing) All right, Scott, bring him out. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY \nRoper growing closer to Korda's position. \nKORDA That's far enough. Bag on the floor. \nRoper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' in there -- all he has to bargain with. \nROPER I've kept my end. Ronnie first. \n", "test3_id": 404}

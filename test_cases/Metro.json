{"test1_input": "Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger. \nROPER Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out. \nEarl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation. \nEARL What are my chances of getting out of here? \nRoper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying. \nROPER Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City... \nRoper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard. \nROPER How ya doin'? \nThe guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces. \nROPER (to Earl) ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway. \nEarl is encouraged by that. \nEARL Really? \nROPER Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. \nRoper looks directly into Earl's eyes. \nROPER He didn't kill anybody, though. \nRoper bends over the guard. \nROPER This is gonna hurt. \nHe grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously. \nEARL Hey, leave him alone. What are you doing? \nRoper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door. \nROPER It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing. \nEarl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. He lets Roper drag the guard to the door. \nROPER I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie. \nEarl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nRoper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of them is Jennings. \nROPER (whispering to Jennings) Give me your gun. \n(NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest. \nROPER I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years. \nJENNINGS Why not keep the streak alive? \nROPER Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nEarl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's back. He's getting very agitated. \nEARL (yelling) HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE! \nThe two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from Earl. \nROPER As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith. \nRoper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave. \nROPER Give me Debbie. \nEarl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head. \nEARL Take the old guy. \nThe other hostages watch this exchange tensely. \nROPER The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie. \nEARL Am I gettin' the car? \nROPER You're gettin' the car. \nEarl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter. \nEARL Take them. \nRoper decides that this is the best he's going to get. \nROPER You two, leave. \nThe two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump up and rush out the front door. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - DAY \nMcCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops. \nFORBES This guy is good. \nMCCALL That's what they say. \nINT. BANK - DAY \n", "test1_true": "Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops and looks over his shoulder. \nROPER Oh, there's one last thing. \nEarl looks like he's right on the edge. \nEARL What?! \nROPER You want a convertible or hardtop? \nEarl thinks about that for a beat... \nROPER Hardtop. \nRoper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the bank. \nROPER (without turning around) Manual or automatic? \nEARL Automatic. \nROPER You got it. \nIn one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!... \nOne SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs. \nSWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody to \"GET DOWN\"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl. \nEARL I give up! I give up! \nRoper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - DAY \nMcCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the bank door. Their police radio squawks... \nRADIO The situation is secured. Suspect in custody. Repeat. Situation secured. \nMcCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the wave of cops rushing into the bank. \nEXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER \nRoper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car. \nRONNIE There's one for the front page. \nRoper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love... which he in fact is. \nROPER Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I can't live without you. \nRonnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that seriously. \nRONNIE Don't start. \nShe slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk off. Roper dogs her. \nROPER This baseball player you're going out with... (shaking his head) He's no good for you. \nRONNIE Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me. \nROPER I worship you. \nRONNIE You worship yourself. \nROPER Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name. \nRONNIE Greg. \nROPER Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair. \nRonnie stops. Looks him in the eye. \nRONNIE You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else. \nROPER Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters. \nRonnie smiles, but offers no response. \nROPER Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease. \nRONNIE I'm going out with Greg tomorrow. \nROPER (frowning) This Greg is really getting in my way. \nRoper gets down on his knees. \nROPER Please. I'm begging you. \nRONNIE Oh, I've got to get a shot of this. \nShe takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He rushes over to his car. \nROPER Hey, that's my car. \nA REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately. \nREPO MAN Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver Hills Financial. \nRoper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved Trans Am. \nINT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING \nLots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones; typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk. \nROPER Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight? \n", "test1_id": 402, "test2_input": "INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT \nRoper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door. Roper races out. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRoper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it open. Gun aimed. \nINT. APT. 302 - NIGHT \nA five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves. \nEXT. BUILDING - NIGHT \nRoper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches. \nINT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN \nAngle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone. \nSOLIS (on the phone) Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him. \nSolis hangs up the phone. \nSOLIS The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. \nROPER (still looking out window) He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... (beat; turning to Solis) I want to be put on this case. \nSOLIS I can't do that. \nROPER (emphatic) I want to be put on this case. \nSOLIS You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it. \nROPER Who's running it? \nSOLIS Roper... \nROPER Who's running it! \nSOLIS Kimura and Glass will head the investigation. \nRoper turns to leave. \nSOLIS Scott. Go home. Get some sleep. \nRoper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT \nTwo detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming. \nROPER Hey, hey, hey... \nRoper intercepts them. \nROPER Anything on Korda so far? \nKIMURA Solis said to keep you clear of this. \nRoper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward Solis' hallway. \nROPER I don't give a damn what Solis said. (to the detectives) If you get a lead, I want to know. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING \nRoper's pickup drives by. \nINT. PICKUP \nThru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost. \nINT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRoper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard. \nRONNIE (O.S.) Just a minute. \nRoper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings. \nRONNIE Hey. \nROPER Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. \nRONNIE (like hell) A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. (smells his breath) Jack Daniels? \nROPER I'm not drunk. Yet. \nRONNIE Maybe you should be. \nROPER You heard. \nShe nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway. \nRONNIE Yeah. I'm sorry. \nROPER Can I come in? \nRonnie opens the door reluctantly. \nINT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "ROPER That a new picture? \nRONNIE About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style. \nRoper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch and his head in Roper's lap. \nROPER Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy? (to Ronnie) He heard my voice. \nRoper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence. His words are light. His tone isn't. \nROPER How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me? \nRonnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried. \nROPER He misses me. \nShe nods. A moment's silence. \nROPER I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. \nRONNIE (a bit surprised at his openness) You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting. \nROPER It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. \nRONNIE Scott, You can't save everyone. \nROPER I've proved that, didn't I? \nShe's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises. \nROPER Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. \nRONNIE (gentle) What do you want from me? \nROPER Something I guess I can't have anymore. \nRONNIE Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again. \nROPER (surprised, hurt) You think I didn't need you? \nRONNIE If you did, you never showed it. \nROPER Ronnie... \nHe reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty. \nROPER You expecting someone? \nHer silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper. \nROPER This day just keeps getting better. \nRonnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets. \nRONNIE (soft) They're on the table where you always leave them. \nHe grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face. \nGREG Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were... \nGreg's smile fades as he sees Roper. \nROPER I was just leaving. \nRoper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him to follow Roper. She calls after him. \nRONNIE Scottie... take care of yourself. \nRoper doesn't look back. He just goes. \nEXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING \nA huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of coffee to go. He enters the warehouse. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - SAME \nCar and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse. \nINT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME \nBuilt on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt. \nKORDA If you weren't family I'd kill you. \nClarence is scared. He offers no defense. \nKORDA You told Antonucci that shit came from me. \nCLARENCE So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike. \nKorda tosses Clarence down onto the cot. \nKORDA You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement. \nCLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off. \nKORDA Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door! \nCLARENCE What happened, Mike. \nKORDA You don't want to know. \nTears start to come to Clarence's eyes. \nCLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike. \n", "test2_id": 403, "test3_input": "ROPER Shut the fuck up! \nThe cabby immediately clams up. \nROPER Get on your radio and get the police here. \nRoper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY \nKorda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers on his face when he sees who's waiting for him. \nKORDA'S POV \nRoper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall. \nKORDA \nDons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his receiver as Roper picks up his. \nROPER If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed. \nKorda feigns total innocence. \nKORDA What in the world are you talking about, Mr. Roper? \nRoper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the glass. \nROPER Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner. \nKorda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His countenance is now a study in hate. \nKORDA I used to have an apartment, a car, jewelry. I had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch. Now look what I have. \nHe motions around. \nKORDA You're threatening me? You think I give a fuck? You think you can scare me off? (a laugh) Why don't you come in here and kick my ass? Get some of your guard friends in here to help. I'd like that. \nRoper glares at him mounting rage. \nKORDA (smirking) He really shook you up, didn't he?... I've got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you. Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality. \nRoper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless. \nKORDA You came here to threaten me? That's a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... Go ahead. Get down on your knees. \nRoper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against the plexiglass wall. \nROPER You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you! \nThe guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out. \nINT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY \nMcCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror. \nMCCALL I'm here to help you. \nNot quite right. He adjusts his stance. This time puts a little hand movement into it. \nMCCALL I'm here to help you. Talk to me. \nHe's still not satisfied. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. ROPER'S OFFICE - DAY \nCaptain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking for McCall. \nSOLIS We got a situation at the V.A. Hospital. The responding officer has requested a negotiator. \nMCCALL Where's Roper? \nSOLIS He's on his way. Get over there. \nEXT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY \nA VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space. \nVET #1 (rambling incoherently) I can't fight this technology. They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments. I've seen those places. Everyone is dressed in white. It's like paper clothing, man. They're not even human. \nVet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very panicky. \nVET #2 Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me in. We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way. \nBut he's not getting through to his friend. \nVET #1 I can't help this, man. Do you have any idea what those microchips look like? How small they are when they put them in your brain? \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nLeading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER #4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees. \nOFFICER #4 When we got here, he was already doing his balancing act. I was talking to him, but it made him more agitated so I backed off. \nMCCALL Why is he up there? \nOFFICER #4 Something about a microchip in his brain. \nMCCALL Who is he? \nA NURSE answers him. \nNURSE HERRIN David Adler. He likes to be called Dave. The other guy is Walter Sinclair. \n", "test3_true": "VOICE (V.O.) Somebody help me out here. Somebody stop him. \nThe nurse turns to McCall. \nNURSE HERRIN What are you waiting for? \nMCCALL Another negotiator is on his way. \nNURSE HERRIN We can't wait for another negotiator. You have to do something. \nMCCALL What about the doctors? \nNURSE HERRIN He hates all the doctors. He says they're in on the conspiracy. \nVET #1 (O.S.) Where is everybody? He's going to kill me! \nMcCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nMcCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's heart jumps into his mouth. \nDAVE Get the fuck out of here! \nMcCall is tense and stiff. He stammers. \nMCCALL I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave. \nDAVE You can't help me, man. \nSo much for McCall's opener. Now what? \nWALTER He's high on something, man. Give him some thorazine or something. \nDave ignores Walter. \nDAVE No one can help me. They're controlling my mind. \nMcCall moves a couple steps closer. \nMCCALL Who's controlling your mind? \nDAVE Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that? \nMcCall fumbles for the right response. \nMCCALL This has nothing to do with Walter. \nDAVE They want Walter dead! \nEXT. STREET BELOW - DAY \nCops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nWalter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, eyes closed, praying. \nMCCALL Dave, look at me. \nDave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead. \nMCCALL Tell me what's wrong. \nDAVE Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me. \nMCCALL How can I help you with the particles? \nDAVE It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis. \nDave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then: \nMCCALL (blurting out) They have less power over you if you look into my eyes. \nDAVE Huh? \nMcCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. Dave turns back around. \nDAVE Huh? \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT \nRoper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN. \nROPER Whata ya got? \nFIREMAN Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair. \nROPER Can you get a net out here? \nFIREMAN Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up. \nEXT. ROOF - DAY \nMcCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him. \nMCCALL We've been onto them for a long time. \nA glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit. \nMCCALL Let me show you something. \nNow he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his beeper. \nMCCALL See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. I'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore. Don't you feel that? You don't have to do what they say. \n", "test3_id": 404}

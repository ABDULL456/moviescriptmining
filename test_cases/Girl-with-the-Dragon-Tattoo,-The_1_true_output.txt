FRODE There's less in his asset column after his conviction today. SALANDER That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean? 
SALANDER If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character. 
FRODE Are you saying he was set up? 
SALANDER That wasn't part of my assignment. 
And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either. FRODE You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. How big of a fool did he make of himself financially? 
SALANDER The judgement will just about empty his savings. This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it. SALANDER May I go? 
FRODE Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include? SALANDER Nothing that warranted inclusion. 
FRODE I'm not sure if that means yes or no. 
ARMANSKY I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated. 
FRODE Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't. 
Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data - SALANDER He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home. 
Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement. 
FRODE You were right not to include that. 
SALANDER I know. FRODE Anything else? SALANDER No. 
FRODE Please think before you say no. SALANDER I did. FRODE I don't want to be surprised by something later.

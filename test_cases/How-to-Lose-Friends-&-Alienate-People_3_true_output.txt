(FOLLOWING HER) Snipe Magazine. 
ALISON What? 
SIDNEY When Clayton left college he started this little magazine called Snipe. Fantastic. Took aim at every self-important celebrity in town. Completely fearless. It was like my magazine but twenty years earlier. 
(MORE) 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) That's why he's hired me. I am the young Clayton Harding. He looks at me and sees his glory days. 
ALISON 
(SARCASTIC) His glory days? Sharps has won fourteen National Magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than 60 percent since he took over. He's paid millions of dollars a year. He lives in a Bank Street townhouse, and weekends in the Hamptons. Clayton Harding is one of the lynchpins of the media-industrial complex. Sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window. 
SIDNEY Yeah, but don't worry. I think I might still be in time to save him. 
44 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - EVENING 44 
The phone is ringing. Sidney walks in from the bedroom, changing into his old brown suit. The answer machine kicks in. 
SIDNEY (O.S.) (over answer machine) You've reached Sidney Young. I'm sorry but my answering machine is out of order, so the voice you are hearing is actually me. The machine BEEPS. Sidney smirks at his joke and is reaching for the phone when we hear the caller - an older man, an upper-class English accent. 
OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (over answer machine) Sidney? Are you there? Sidney stops in his tracks, something complicated and fearful crossing his face. 
OLDER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Sidney? Are you there? Sidney tiptoes back out of the room. 
OLDER MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) If you're there Sidney, answer the phone. We hear the opening of Fly Me To The Moon by Julie London 
45 INT. TOWN CAR - EVENING 45 
Sidney sits in the car beside Alison and Maddox, staring out the window, entranced by the bright lights as they pass by... 
46 EXT. HOTEL - FUND-RAISER PARTY - NIGHT 46 
The rooftop swimming pool of a hotel. Flowers everywhere, including in the pool. Guests mill around drinking. We find Sidney working his way through the throng to where Alison stands. 
SIDNEY 
(MOUTH FULL) There's a couple of hundred grands worth of food here and I swear I'm the only person eating it. You want some? Alison recoils. Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the music as he eats. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) This place is amazing. It's wall to wall totty. 
ALISON Wall to wall what? 
SIDNEY Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive women. 
ALISON Do you mind? 
SIDNEY What? Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at Maddox. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Look at that. All night people have been treating us like we're royalty. In London, the journalist's motto is "Everybody hates us and we don't care." 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Well, now you're one of the High Priests of what's Hot and what's Not. So what were you two talking about? 
ALISON Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(ENJOYING THIS) Uh-oh. I don't think Miss Olsen approves of you, Sidney. Sidney watches some beautiful women pass, dripping diamonds. 
SIDNEY I shouldn't be here. I get thrown out of places like this. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX This? This is a McDonald's. I hate disease parties. (Off Sidney's puzzled look) Fund- raisers. Someone's CELL PHONE RINGS. All of the guests automatically check their cells. An OLDER ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks over - she's a little drunk. 
WOMAN Lawrence Maddox? Oh my goodness... Long time. Maddox examines her coolly. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Rachel! Lawrence barely bothers to conceal the fact he doesn't remember her. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Rachel. How are you? 
RACHEL Well, I'm just wonderful. Wonderful. How are you? Lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering. Rachel tries again.

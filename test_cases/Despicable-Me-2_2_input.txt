AGNES Whoa! 
It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion. The girls SCREAM as it jumps up and dashes towards them. 
Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls.    They are backed into a corner. It's all over. 
Then suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor. Then he sits up and-- 
Has turned back into a YELLOW MINION.    It's Kevin! 
KEVIN Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos? 
AGNES Kevin! 
The other minions dog pile on him with friendly hugs. 
MARGO Dr. Nefario! You're back! 
Reveal Dr. Nefario holding the needle. 
DR. NEFARIO In the flesh. 
Nefario produces a VIAL filled with YELLOW LIQUID. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Behold, the antidote! 
He walks over to a vat of the jelly. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use. 
He pours the antidote into the vat. 
EXT: EL MACHO'S HOUSE - LATER 
Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house. He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave and Stuart, who have been painted purple to look like Evil minions. But they are goofing around and giggling. And they still have a few yellow spots. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   92. 
GRU Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused here! 
The minions somber up. 
MINIONS Okay, okay. 
Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint. 
They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He responds back in Evil Minion gibberish. 
The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open. 
The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously. 
Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear. 
GRU (attempting to act) Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me. 
The Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this. 
Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to GROWL back. 
It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it. 
Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint. 
One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp. 
GRU (CONT'D) Run! 
They take off running. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      93. 
EXT: EL MACHO'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard. The Evil Minions give chase. 
GRU Up that tree! Hurry, hurry! 
They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either. 
With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top--a dead end.

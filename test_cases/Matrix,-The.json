That was your note, wasn't it? \nTRINITY I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't. \nNEO Who wouldn't? \nTRINITY I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo.  You are in a lot of danger. \nNEO What?  Why? \nTRINITY They're watching you.  Something happened and they found out about you.  Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go.  But this time, we can't do that. \nNEO I don't understand -- \nTRINITY You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question. \nNEO The Matrix.  What is the Matrix? \nTRINITY Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question.  That they had to see it, to believe it. \nHer body is against his; her lips very close to his ear. \nTRINITY He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes.  Your life and the world you live in will never be the same.  It's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling. \nThere is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the words like a drug, seeping into him. \nTRINITY The truth is out there, Neo.  It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to. \nShe takes hold of him with her eyes. \nTRINITY That's all I can tell you right now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good luck. \nNEO Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the man? \nShe leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers. \nTRINITY You know who. \nShe turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies. \nA SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music, pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT \nThe sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face: 9:15 A.M. \nNEO Shitshitshit. \nEXT.  SKYSCRAPER \nThe downtown office of CorTechs, a software development company. \nINT.  CORTECHS OFFICE \nThe main offices are along each wall, the windows overlooking downtown Chicago. \nRHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo without looking at him, typing at his computer continuously. \nNeo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the surface of the glass. \nRHINEHEART You have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you. \nHe stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in time. \nRHINEHEART Obviously, you are mistaken. \nHis long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard. \nRHINEHEART This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole.  Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. \nHe turns again. \nRHINEHEART The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.  Do I make myself clear? \nNEO Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly clear. \nINT.  NEO'S CUBICLE \nThe entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators. \nNeo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition. \nTALL EMPLOYEE What did he say? \nNEO If I was late again, I'm going to be fired. \nHe smirks. \n", "test1_true": "Neo glares at him, as he sinks down. \nVOICE (O.S.) Thomas Anderson? \nNeo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle door. \nNEO Yeah.  That's me. \nNeo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him the softpak. \nFEDEX Have a nice day. \nHe opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he flips it open. \nNEO Hello? \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus. \nNeo's knees give and he falls into his chair. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo? \nNEO ... no. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not sure what they're going to do. \nNEO Who's coming for me? \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Stand up and see for yourself. \nNEO Right now? \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Yes.  Now. \nNeo starts to stand. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator. \nHis head slowly peeks up over the partition. \nAt the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and points out Neo's cubicle. \nNeo ducks. \nNEO Holy fuckin' shit! \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Yes. \nOne cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents. \nNEO What the fuck do they want with me?! \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I'm not sure.  But, if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there. \nNEO How?! \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say. \nThe agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) The cubicle across from you is empty. \nNEO But what if...? \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Go!  Now! \nNeo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle just as the agents turn into his row. \nNeo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone tightly to him. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Stay here for a moment. \nThe agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to search the bathroom. \nMorpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) A little longer... \nBrown is talking to the tall employee. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay.as low as you can. \nSweat trickles down his forehead. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Now. \nNeo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around. \nStaying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING across the opening to the first office on the left. \nThe room is empty. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Good.  Now there is a window. Open it. \nNEO How do you know all this? \nMorpheus laughs quietly. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) The answer is coming, Neo. \nHe opens the window.  The window howls into the room. \n", "test1_id": 822, "test2_input": "She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away. \nIt seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets out of bed. \nINT.  HALL \nThe ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nThe core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him. \nCYPHER Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne. \nNEO Sorry. \nCYPHER No, it's all right. \nNEO What are you doing? \nCYPHER Midnight watch. \nNeo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data. \nNEO Is that... ? \nCYPHER The Matrix?  Yeah. \nThe monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations. \nCYPHER You want a drink? \nHe pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug. \nCYPHER I'll tell you, I feel for you, man.  I really do.  Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you had a real life. \nNeo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds on his back. \nCYPHER Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells. \nRed-faced, Neo finally stops coughing. \nCYPHER Did he tell you why he did it? \nNeo nods. \nCYPHER, I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he thought he found the One. \nNeo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs. \nCYPHER Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right.  Understand? \nCypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful. \nCYPHER Welcome to the real world! \nINT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nCHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak. \nCYPHER That's what he said to me nine years ago. \nThe meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream. \nCYPHER The real world.  Ha, what a joke. \nWe recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh. \nCYPHER You know what real is?  I'll tell you what real is. \nA fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher. \nCYPHER Real is just another four-letter word. \nHe laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth. \nThe restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices. \nSitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith. \nAGENT SMITH Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? \nCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth. \nCYPHER Mmm, so, so fucking good. \nSmith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth. \nCYPHER You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist.  I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.  After nine years, do you know what I've realized? \nPausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth. \nCYPHER Ignorance is bliss. \nAGENT SMITH Then we have a deal? \nCYPHER I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing!  You understand?  And I want to be rich.  Someone important.  Like an actor.  You can do that, right? \nAGENT SMITH Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan. \nCypher takes a deep drink of wine. \nCYPHER All right.  You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want. \n", "test2_true": "CYPHER I told you, I don't know them.

MAIN DECK \nSweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct coma. \nNEO Jeez, I was wondering about that. \nTANK What? \nNEO Why I was bald here but not in the Matrix. \nTANK R.S.I. \nNEO Residual self image. \nTANK Good.  Now what's this? \nHe points to one of Neo's monitors. \nNEO Life systems monitor, glucose levels. \nTANK What's that? \nNEO Main power supply to the core. \nHe follows Tank to the operator's station where he points to a red key-switch. \nTANK How about this? \nNEO Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all remaining power to generate an... E.M.P? \nTANK Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best weapon against the machines.  The problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes off, they're not coming back. \nNeo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them. \nMORPHEUS How's he doing? \nTANK We just finished the operation programs and he's showing great retention. \nMORPHEUS Good.  I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by.  We're going in. Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here. \nMorpheus walks away. \nNEO What's he talking about? \nTANK He's taking you into the Matrix to see her. \nNEO See who? \nTANK The Oracle. \nNeo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING -- \nEXT.

In the bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE begins to RING. \nIn the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team. \nMorpheus answers the phone. \nMORPHEUS We're in. \nHe hangs up. \nMORPHEUS Mouse and Cable hold the exit. Let's go. \nINT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY \nNeo follows the others down the stairwell that winds around an antique elevator shaft. \nNEO Did you have to do this? \nTRINITY Yeah. \nNEO What did she tell you? \nTRINITY Lots of things. \nNEO Any of them true? \nTrinity looks at him, then looks away. \nTRINITY Some of them. \nGIZMO Were they good or bad? \nTRINITY There's no point in worrylng.

What matters is what you believe. \nNEO I believe... \nHe stares at the fullness of her lips. \nNEO I want to kiss you. \nShe smiles. \nTRINITY I want to kiss you too... \nThe PHONE begins to RING. \nTRINITY But I want it to be real. \nShe pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old Man had been. \nShe hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal. \nThe GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the plastic WINDOW just as -- \nTrinity disappears. \nThe handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE. \nINT.

{"train": "THE MATRIX \nWritten by \nLarry and Andy Wachowski \nApril 8, 1996 \nFADE IN ON: \nCOMPUTER SCREEN \nSo close it has no boundaries. \nA blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the derma of black-neon glass. \nA PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were making the call.  The cursor continues to throb, relentlessly patient, until -- \nMAN (V.O.) Hello? \nData now slashes across the screen, information flashing faster than we read. \nSCREEN Call trans opt:  received. 2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log> \nWOMAN (V.O.) I'm inside.  Anything to report? \nWe listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, TRINITY. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Let's see.  Target left work at 5:01 PM. \nSCREEN Trace program:  running. \nThe entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers. Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10- digit phone number in the top corner. \nCYPHER (V.O.) He caught the northbound Howard line. Got off at Sheridan. Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six- pack of beer and a box of Captain Crunch.  Returned home. \nThe area code is identified.  The first three numbers suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns. \nWe begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine. \nTRINITY (V.O.) All right, you're relieved.  Use the usual exit. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Do you know when we're going to make contact? \nTRINITY Soon. \nOnly two thin digits left. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Just between you and me, you don't believe it, do you?  You don't believe this guy is the one? \nTRINITY (V.O.) I think Morpheus believes he is. \nCYPHER (V.O.) I know.  But what about you? \nTRINITY (V.O.) I think Morpheus knows things that I don't. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Yeah, but if he's wrong -- \nThe final number pops into place -- \nTRINITY (V.O.) Did you hear that? \nCYPHER (V.O.) Hear what? \nSCREEN Trace complete.  Call origin: \nTRINITY (V.O.) Are you sure this line is clean? \nCYPHER (V.O.) Yeah, course I'm sure. \nWe MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR. \nTRINITY (V.O.) I better go. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side. \nShe hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the netherworld of the computer screen. \nWhere gradually the sound of a police radio grows around us. \nRADIO (V.O.) Attention all units.  Attention all units. \nSuddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in -- \nINT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow. \nWe FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of room 303. \nThe biggest of them violently kicks in the door -- \nThe other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them. \nBIG COP Police!  Freeze! \nThe room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold- up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the computer. \nSitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is TRINITY; a woman in black leather. \nBIG COP Get your hands behind your head! \nTrinity rises. \nThe METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity turns to it, racing for the back of the building. \nThe edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other roof. \nThe cops slow, realizing they are about to see something ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself into the air. \nFrom above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she hangs in flight \nThen hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard. \nCOP Motherfucker -- that's impossible! \nThey stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto one knee. \nJust below the building are the runbling tracks of riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing easily. \nShe looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air barely reaching the last car \nAgent Brown stands, yanking out a gun. \nTrinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head. \nAhead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point where the train has begun to turn, there is -- \nA window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building. \nTrinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the turn. \nTrinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head as -- \nThe whole world seems to spin on its axis -- \nAnd she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down stairs bleeding, broken -- \nBut still alive. \nThrough the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown, still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train slides him past the window. \nTrinity tries to move.  Everything hurts. \nTRINITY Get up, Trinity.  You're fine. Get up -- just get up! \nShe stands and limps down the rest of the stairs. \nEXT.  STREET \nTrinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she sees it. \nThe telephone booth. \nObviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE begins to RING. \nAcross the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates. \nTrinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim. \nGritting through the pain, she races the truck -- \nSlamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as -- \nShe answers the phone. \nThere is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk -- \nBarreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp. \nAfter a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage. There is no body.  Trinity is gone. \nHis jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration. AGENT JONES walks up behind him. \nAGENT SMITH Did you get anything from the room? \nAGENT JONES Their next target.  The name is Neo. \nThe handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated in the crash like a severed limb. \nAGENT SMITH We'll need a search running. \nAGENT JONES It's already begun. \nWe are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall through one -- \nSwallowed by the darkness that becomes -- \nA computer screen. \nWe are on-line, inside a chat room called \"The Matrix.\" It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out. \nSCREEN JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been on this board. SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even exist and the Matrix is nothing but an advertising gimmick 4 a new game. TIMAXE:  All I want to know is Trinity really a girl? LODIII:  87% of all women on line are really men. QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism for the government. SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the system controlling our lives. TIMAXE:  You mean MTV. SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega. FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!! \nWe drift back from the electric conversation entering -- \nINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT \nIt is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with technology. \nWeed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks. \nTabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse. \nWe turn towards the center of this rat-nest of technology, following the slurping and crunching of cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find -- \nNEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a computer than living outside one. \nTRINITY What? \nNEO I just thought... you were a guy. \nTRINITY Most guys do. \nNeo is a little embarrassed. \nNEO Do you want to go sorewhere and talk? \nTRINITY No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time. \nThe MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking directly into each other's ear. \nNEO That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it? \nTRINITY I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't. \nNEO Who wouldn't? \nTRINITY I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo.  You are in a lot of danger. \nNEO What?  Why? \nTRINITY They're watching you.  Something happened and they found out about you.  Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go.  But this time, we can't do that. \nNEO I don't understand -- \nTRINITY You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question. \nNEO The Matrix.  What is the Matrix? \nTRINITY Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question.  That they had to see it, to believe it. \nHer body is against his; her lips very close to his ear. \nTRINITY He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes.  Your life and the world you live in will never be the same.  It's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling. \nThere is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the words like a drug, seeping into him. \nTRINITY The truth is out there, Neo.  It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to. \nShe takes hold of him with her eyes. \nTRINITY That's all I can tell you right now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good luck. \nNEO Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the man? \nShe leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers. \nTRINITY You know who. \nShe turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies. \nA SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music, pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT \nThe sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face: 9:15 A.M. \nNEO Shitshitshit. \nEXT.  SKYSCRAPER \nThe downtown office of CorTechs, a software development company. \nINT.  CORTECHS OFFICE \nThe main offices are along each wall, the windows overlooking downtown Chicago. \nRHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo without looking at him, typing at his computer continuously. \nNeo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the surface of the glass. \nRHINEHEART You have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you. \nHe stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in time. \nRHINEHEART Obviously, you are mistaken. \nHis long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard. \nRHINEHEART This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole.  Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. \nHe turns again. \nRHINEHEART The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.  Do I make myself clear? \nNEO Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly clear. \nINT.  NEO'S CUBICLE \nThe entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators. \nNeo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition. \nTALL EMPLOYEE What did he say? \nNEO If I was late again, I'm going to be fired. \nHe smirks. \nA featureless black van glides up to a staircase that curls down from the city's surface. \ntrinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man. \nHis name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity, exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking braces. \nGIZMO Va va va voom.  Still the hottest software around. \nTRINITY Hello, Gizmo. \nNeo hears the voices around him. \nGIZMO This is really the guy?  The guy that Morpheus thinks -- \nTRINITY Yeah. \nGIZMO But he's so old. \nTRINITY Are you going to help us or aren't you? \nGIZMO Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top and let's get the hell outta here. \nHacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van. \nA moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the underworld. \nINT.  VAN \nThe chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives, cleavers, and stainless steel clamps. \nNeo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening nervously as Gizmo gets to work. \nGIZMO Okay, first we take a little look under the hood. \nHe pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising to varying levels of magnification. \nGIZMO You're going to feel a little prick. \nHe inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors. Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens. \nNEO What are you doing? \nTRINITY We think you're bugged.  We can't take you to Morpheus until you're clean. \nGIZMO There it is. \nOn a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large intestines. \nGIZMO Hit him with 10 ccs of local. \nHacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic around Neols navel. \nUsing a device that looks like a miniature speculum, Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the tip. \nOn the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw. \nGIZMO Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. \nThe claw snags hold of the bug. \nGIZMO Gotcha! \nBut the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps itself around the soft tissue web of intestine. \nGIZMO Shit. \nTRINITY What's happening? \nGIZMO I don't know.  They've never done that before. \nNeo writhes in pain. \nGIZMO Hold him down. \nNEO Jesus!  God! \nTRINITY Do something! \nGIZMO I got it!  Maybe we can stun it. \nTRINITY Are you crazy?  That will kill him. \nWe watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about. \nGIZMO It'll work.  Come on, do it or Hacksaw will. \nNEO Do what? \nThe instant he hears the word, he knows. \nTRINITY Clear. \nNEO Oh, shit -- \nThe cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug. \nGIZMO Hit him again! \nAgain, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo yanks the speculum out. \nGIZMO Got it! \nTrinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe. She eases the tape off his eyes. \nMORPHEUS We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical.  Have you ever wondered why? \nNeo shakes his head. \nMORPHEUS As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult. \nNEO Free from what? \nMORPHEUS From the Matrix. \nNeo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself. \nMORPHEUS Do you want to know what it is, Neo? \nNeo swallows and nods his head. \nMORPHEUS It's that feeling you have had all your life.  That feeling that something was wrong with the world.  You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me.  But what is it? \nThe LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back. \nMORPHEUS The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. \nNEO What truth? \nMORPHEUS That you are a slave, Neo.  That you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A prison for your mind. \nOutside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass. \nMORPHEUS Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself. \nNEO How? \nMORPHEUS Hold out your hands. \nIn Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill. \nMORPHEUS This is your last chance.  After this, there is no going back. \nIn his left, a blue pill. \nMORPHEUS You take the blue pill and the story ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe. \nThe pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses. \nMORPHEUS You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. \nNeo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the moisture growing in his palms. \nMORPHEUS Remember that all I am offering is the truth.  Nothing more. \nNeo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The Cheshire smile returns. \nMORPHEUS Follow me. \nHe leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green from the racks of monitors. \nTrinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter. \nCYPHER Shit. \nTRINITY I knew he would. \nCypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone away from, Neo. \nCYPHER Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm afraid he might pop. \nMORPHEUS Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line? \nNeo recognizes the large man from the El train. \nAPOC Almost. \nHe and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives. \nNEO Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus. \nAPOC That's right. \nMORPHEUS Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there? \nIn the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. \nMORPHEUS I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality. \nNeo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck. \nNEO A little. \nMORPHEUS Tell me about it. \nNEO Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program. \nMORPHEUS If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world? \nNEO You might not, no. \nMORPHEUS No, you wouldn't. \nNeo whispers to Trinity. \nNEO You did all this? \nShe nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone. \nFanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing petal attached to a black metal stem. \nAbove him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks out. \nThe image assaults his mind. \nTowers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an underwater abyss. \nHis sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of Leviathan. \nBelow Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space. \nInside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby. \nFrom above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo. \nHe swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him. \nIt is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and soft polymers. \nA black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex. \nAt the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens, disengaging. \nThe cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other connective hoses snap free and snake away as -- \nThe back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo into a black hole. \nINT.  WASTE LINE \nThe pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls, sliding with the clot of gelatin. \nBanking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of cellulite. \nNeo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste. \nThe metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside the sewer main line. \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nThe metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo onto the floor. \nHuman hands and arms help him up as he finds himself looking straight at Morpheus. \nTrinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high- tech combat gear. \nMorpheus smiles. \nMORPHEUS Welcome to the real world, Neo. \nNeo passes out. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nWe have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering. \nMAN (O.S.) Do you think Morpheus is right? Do you think he could be the One? \nWOMAN (O.S.) It doesn't matter now.  But if he's wrong... \nFADE IN: \nNEO'S POV \nNeo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us, angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick. \nANGLE ON NEO \nNEO ... am I dead? \nTRINITY Far from it. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nANGLE ON NEO \nHe opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device. \nDOZER He needs a lot of work. \nMORPHEUS I know. \nDozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo. \nNEO What are you doing? \nMORPHEUS Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them. \nFluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright. \nNEO Why do my eyes hurt? \nMORPHEUS You've never used them before. \nMorpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo. Neo lays back. \nMORPHEUS Rest, Neo.  The answers are coming. \nINT.  NEO'S ROOM \nNeo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is wearing a black tank top and shorts. \nMORPHEUS This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century.  This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. \nWe GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel. \nMORPHEUS You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory.  This is Chicago as it exists today. \nThe sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out beneath us as we ENTER the television. \nMORPHEUS 'The desert of the real.' \nIn the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long-dead corpse. \nMORPHEUS We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface.  The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground. \nStill MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair. \nNEO What happened? \nMORPHEUS It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. \nIn his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather. \nMORPHEUS At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was not enough. \nIn the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light up a bloody battle field. \nMORPHEUS We don't know who struck first. Us or them.  But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined. \nWe MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us. \nMORPHEUS The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red. \nAt last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is perpetually in motion. \nThe Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside. \nMORPHEUS It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive. \nThe Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud of stain. \nMORPHEUS They discovered a new form of fusion.  All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge.  Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive.  Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. \nWe return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons. \nMORPHEUS The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat. \nOutside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields. \nMORPHEUS We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living. \nHuge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop. \nMORPHEUS All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind. \nWe see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already growing around the brain-jack. \nMORPHEUS And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves. \nWe PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the Construct. \nNEO No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible! \nMORPHEUS I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth. \nThe room without walls begins to spin. \nNEO Stop!  Let me out!  I want out! \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nHis eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair, trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck. \nNEO Get this thing out of me! \nTRINITY Easy, Neo.  Easy. \nDozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out, he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the harness. \nNEO Don't touch me!  Get away from me! \nOn his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge. \nCYPHER He's going to pop! \nVomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out. \nINT.  NEO'S ROOM \nHe blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark. Neo is stretched out on his bed. \nNEO I can't go back, can I? \nMorpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner. \nMORPHEUS No.  But if you could, would you really want to? \nNeo isn't sure of that answer. \nMORPHEUS I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age.  It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen.  I broke the rule because I had to. \nHe stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as Neo. \nMORPHEUS When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.  It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future. \nINT.  DOJO \nThey are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo. \nMORPHEUS This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.  Consider this your first lesson. \nHe assumes a fighting stance. \nMORPHEUS Attack me. \nNeo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack. \nIt is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack \nBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nWhile their minds battle in the programmed reality, the two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive chairs. \nTank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and steady rhythm of Morpheus. \nINT.  MESS HALL \nDinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency. \nMOUSE bursts in the room. \nMOUSE Morpheus is fighting Neo! \nAll at once they bolt for the door. \nINT.  DOJO \nNeo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls himself at Morpheus. \nMORPHEUS Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique. \nMorpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until -- \nNeo falls. \nPanting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo. \nMORPHEUS How did I beat you? \nNEO You -- You're too fast. \nMORPHEUS Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? \nNeo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath. \nMORPHEUS Do you believe that's air you are breathing now? \nNeo squints at him. \nMORPHEUS If you can free your mind, the body will follow. \nNeo stands, nodding. \nMORPHEUS Again. \nTheir fists fly with  pneumatic speed. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nEveryone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight, like watching a game of Mortal Combat. \nCABLE Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast! \nMOUSE You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank? \nTANK Never. \nAPOC Morpheus is right.  He's got to be the one. \nINT.  DOJO \nThe speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm with a scream. \nHe wants to beat Morpheus bad. \nFinally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the head, knocking his glasses off. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nThere are several gasps. \nMOUSE I don't believe it! \nINT.  DOJO \nMorpheus rubs his face. \nMORPHEUS You are angry with me. \nNeo pants. \nNEO I, uh... maybe. \nMORPHEUS It's all right.  It's natural. \nNEO I feel better. \nShe pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away. \nIt seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets out of bed. \nINT.  HALL \nThe ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nThe core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him. \nCYPHER Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne. \nNEO Sorry. \nCYPHER No, it's all right. \nNEO What are you doing? \nCYPHER Midnight watch. \nNeo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data. \nNEO Is that... ? \nCYPHER The Matrix?  Yeah. \nThe monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations. \nCYPHER You want a drink? \nHe pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug. \nCYPHER I'll tell you, I feel for you, man.  I really do.  Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you had a real life. \nNeo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds on his back. \nCYPHER Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells. \nRed-faced, Neo finally stops coughing. \nCYPHER Did he tell you why he did it? \nNeo nods. \nCYPHER, I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he thought he found the One. \nNeo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs. \nCYPHER Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right.  Understand? \nCypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful. \nCYPHER Welcome to the real world! \nINT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nCHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak. \nCYPHER That's what he said to me nine years ago. \nThe meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream. \nCYPHER The real world.  Ha, what a joke. \nWe recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh. \nCYPHER You know what real is?  I'll tell you what real is. \nA fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher. \nCYPHER Real is just another four-letter word. \nHe laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth. \nThe restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices. \nSitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith. \nAGENT SMITH Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? \nCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth. \nCYPHER Mmm, so, so fucking good. \nSmith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth. \nCYPHER You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist.  I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.  After nine years, do you know what I've realized? \nPausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth. \nCYPHER Ignorance is bliss. \nAGENT SMITH Then we have a deal? \nCYPHER I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing!  You understand?  And I want to be rich.  Someone important.  Like an actor.  You can do that, right? \nAGENT SMITH Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan. \nCypher takes a deep drink of wine. \nCYPHER All right.  You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want. \nNeo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright. He is the only one without sunglasses. \nMORPHEUS Do you now understand what it means when we say, if you're not one of us, you're one of them? \nNEO The agents.  They're sentient programs.  They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe. \nMORPHEUS Anyone that is still in a power plant.  That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix. \nNEO The best hacking is always traceless. \nCypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he surreptitiously drops something inside. \nIt is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as the LINE CONNECTS. \nAn early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in. \nINT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY \nAn enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can. \nMOJO Morpheus, been a long time coming. \nMORPHEUS You're looking well, Mojo. \nMojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo. \nMOJO You bringing us geriatrics now. Morpheus? \nHe spits and laughs again. \nMOJO Guess you are locking for a miracle. \nEXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes. \nINT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY \nA lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not expected. \nThe front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. \nMojo talks to the bartender, then looks over. \nMOJO All right, it's cool.  Go on back. \nThey weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET. \nA monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up. \nREX You're late. \nHe moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only door. \nINT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY \nA high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, \"Welcome Morpheus.\" \nMorpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it now leads into -- \nINT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows, his mouth agape. \nNEO What -- what happened? \nMORPHEUS This is the temple.  It is a part of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it. \nTwo PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber. \nPRIESTESS Hello, Morpheus.  We've been expecting you. \nMORPHEUS Okay, you're on your own.  Go with them. \nThey take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into another room. \nPRIESTESS Wait here.  Among the other Potentials. \nINT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY \nNeo enters and finally understands the attention given to his age.  The Potentials are all little children. \nThe room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing, others meditating or practicing their gift. \nNeo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind. \nNeo crosses to him, sits. \nThe Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make it bend. \nSPOON BOY Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon.  Mine bends because there is no spoon, just my mind. \nNeo watches as it curls into a knot. \nSPOON BOY Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend yourself. \nNeo nods, again holding up his spoon. \nNEO There is no spoon.  Right. \nHe concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the Priestess touches his shoulder. \nPRIESTESS The Oracle will see you now. \nHe eyes her, then takes a cookie. \nORACLE Make a believer out of you yet. \nINT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY \nMorpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on Neo's shoulder. \nMORPHEUS You don't have to tell me anything, Neo, because I already know what she said. \nNEO You do? \nMORPHEUS I brought you so that you could hear it for yourself.  I knew it would help. \nNeo finishes his cookie. \nMORPHEUS No one will ever ask you because it is a gift from her.  It is for you and you alone. \nEXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nStorm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns jaundice. \nCypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets. He notices several unmarked white vans. \nHe mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees the black Lincoln. \nTRINITY Here they come. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nIn the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's face and neck. \nTank is typing rapidly at the keyboard. \nTANK Weird.  This area never has this much activity. \nEXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY \nApoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel. \nINT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY \nMouse's CELLULAR RINGS. \nMOUSE Welcome to Movie-Phone. \nTANK (V.O.) They're on their way. \nMOUSE Right. \nThe phone flips shut as he jumps up. \nMOUSE Let's get to work. \nINT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY \nLight filters down the throat of the building through a caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft. Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around the antique elevator. \nNeo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs. \nA moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and moves identically to the first one. \nNEO Whoa.  Deja vu. \nThose words stop the others dead in their tracks. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nThe monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an electronic seizure. \nTANK Oh, shit!  Oh, shit! \nINT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY \nTrinity turns around, her face tight. \nTRINITY What did you just say? \nNEO Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu. \nTRINITY What happened?  What did you see? \nNEO A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it. \nTRINITY How much like it?  Was it the same cat? \nNEO It might have been.  I'm not sure. \nTrinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the rasping breath of the old building. \nNEO What is it? \nTRINITY A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something. \nShe also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nTank sees what was changed. \nTANK It's a trap! \nINT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY \nTANK Got it. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I need the main wet-wall. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece. \nINT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY \nMorpheus is guided by Tank. \nTANK (V.O.) Now left and that's it in front of you. \nMORPHEUS Good. \nHe cuts off the phone. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead. \nAGENT SMITH Eighth floor.  They're on the eighth floor. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Brown hears Smith on his earphone. \nAGENT BROWTJ Eighth floor!  Move! \nINT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY \nCops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere. \nINT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY \nSeveral cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed through the plaster and lathe. \nINT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nThey are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming their way down the greasy, black stack pipes. \nAbove them, light fills the hole they made to get inside. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nBrown turns to Smith. \nAGENT BROWN Where are they? \nINT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom. \nINT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nCypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and several thick supply pipes. \nINT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when -- \nThe WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop realizes -- \nCOP They're in the walls! \nINT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nNeo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE -- \nBULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box of soot-black space. \nINT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun barrel, lighting up the wall until -- \nA BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the BODY fall with a THUD. \nAGENT SMITH Are orders that hard to follow? I'll say it again.  Morpheus must be taken alive.  Understand? \nINT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nThey're almost falling, they're climbing so fast. \nAbove them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust. \nINT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed intestines of the building, and realizes where they are going. \nAGENT SMITH How like a rodent. \nINT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nJust below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light raking across the lathe. \nCOP I got him!  I got him! \nTrinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for cover. \nThey continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful of her hair. \nHe starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking the Cop out. \nMORPHEUS Oh, so have I. \nAgent Smith smiles. \nINT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY \nTrinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them -- \nTHROUGH a grate INTO the fight. \nEXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nSmith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding police. \nAgent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers Morpheus. \nAGENT SMITH You can't win. \nMorpheus smiles. \nMORPHEUS I already have. \nHe stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his eyes. \nAGENT SMITH Take him. \nCops swarm over Morpheus. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nTank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for Morpheus. \nTANK No! \nEXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY \nCuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut. \nAgent Jones finds Agent Smith. \nAGENT JONES The others were lost. \nAGENT SMITH You've taken care of Reagan? \nAgent Jones nods. \nAGENT SMITH Then the others do not matter. \nEXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nA manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the cover opens. \nNeo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a water-logged phone from her pocket. \nTRINITY We need a phone. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nTank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix. \nTANK We gotta find the others.  They're still alive. \nThe PHONE RINGS. \nTANK Operator. \nCYPHER (V.O.) I need an exit!  Fast! \nTANK Cypher?  I thought they had you? \nEXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nCypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car. \nCYPHER There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  They're all dead.  I still got the shakes but, Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nDozer spots the wreck. \nDOZER There he is. \nTANK I got you. \nCYPHER (V.O.) Just get me outta here. \nEXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nTANK (V.O.) Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store. \nCypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive. \nCYPHER An actor.  Definitely. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nThe PHONE RINGS.  Tank answers. \nTANK Operator. \nTRINITY (V.O.) Tank, it's me. \nEXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nBeneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung from climbing harnesses. \nNeo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Jones looks at Morpheus. \nAGENT JONES I think they're trying to save him. \nINT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY \nNeo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath. \nNEO There is no spoon. \nNeo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower than where they attached themselves. \nBOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS. \nThe counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up through the shaft as -- \nThe elevator falls away beneath them, distending space, filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar to the top. \nINT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe ELEVATOR hits the botton. \nBA-BOOM! \nThe massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds engulfing the elevator section of the lobby. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS. \nAGENT JONES Lower level -- \nAGENT BROWN They are actually attacking. \nINT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY \nHanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the door. \nINT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY \nNervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR \"DINGS\" softly and slides open. \nBlack smoke rises out of the exposed shaft. \nThe nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the churning blaze engulfing the lower levels. \nHe does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too late. \nKrack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into the shaft. \nBefore the others can react, Trinity flips out into the hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another. \nThe fight is over before it begins. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nAn enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin showering the room. \nAgent Smith smashes a table. \nAGENT SMITH Find them and destroy them! \nAgent Jones nods and touches his ear piece. \nEXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines. \nGuns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists. \nAcross the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter watches the ferocious onslaught. \nPILOT I repeat, we are under attack! \nSuddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as -- \nAgent Jones emerges. \nJust as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's coming. \nNeo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him. \nScreaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with thought-speed. \nFingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we look through the sights and gun smoke at -- \nThe Agent blurred with motion -- \nUntil the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal. \nNEO Trinity! \nAgent Jones charges. \nNEO ... help. \nHis GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of -- \nAnd finally Agent Jones. \nNeo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action. \nNEO Get up, Morpheus!  Get up! \nMorpheus sits unmoving, his head still down. \nNeo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into the adjoining room. \nHe attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN FIRE. \nQuickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room, WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving for cover. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nJust outside the Presidential Suite, three marines blister with snow-static. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nMorpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes, still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close. \nAnd when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing with fire. \nThe Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's BULLET TRAILS chase them. \nMorpheus strains at his handcuffs. \nThe Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD, RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER. \nFIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping the handcuffs, starting for the window. \nAgent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open bedroom door. \nAGENT SMITH Nooo! \nHe FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect line. \nFor an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk. \nAnd as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet buries itself in his leg -- \nKnocking him off balance. \nNEO He won't make it. \nMorpheus lunges, out of control -- \nAs Neo spins, every move a whip crack -- \nSnapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar. \nMorpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space -- \nFlying for a moment. \nThe rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord attached to a machine. \nAs their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until -- \nThey collide. \nAlmost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs, scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and clinging. \nUntil the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling down -- \nThe ground deliriously distant -- \nAs Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist. \nNEO Gotcha! \nTrinity is already pulling the copter up and away. \nAs Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine. \nHe'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he aims at something only he can see: the oil line. \nPONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood. \nTRINITY Shit-shit-no! \nNeo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE. \nNEO Oh fuck. \nTrinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building. \nMorpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall. \nThe ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow while -- \nThe Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings. \nCarried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where -- \nNeo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach himself but -- \nThe helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof like a setting sun -- \nThe coils of slack snap taught -- \nYanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as -- \nHis eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark. \nEXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will never be free of the Matrix. \nHe starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring -- \nINT.  \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY \nAs the Old Man stares. \nTrinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing close enough to kiss him. \nTRINITY Morpheus is right, you know.  It doesn't matter what he believes or even what the Oracle believes. What matters is what you believe. \nNEO I believe... \nHe stares at the fullness of her lips. \nNEO I want to kiss you. \nShe smiles. \nTRINITY I want to kiss you too... \nThe PHONE begins to RING. \nTRINITY But I want it to be real. \nShe pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old Man had been. \nShe hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal. \nThe GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the plastic WINDOW just as -- \nTrinity disappears. \nThe handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE. \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nTrinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the Construct. \nTRINITY Neo! \nTANK What the hell just happened? \nTRINITY An Agent!  You have to send me back! \nTANK I can't! \nINT.  \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY \nGUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men BLASTING, moving at impossible speed. \nFor a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME. \nGun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges cartwheel into space. \nAn instant later they are nearly on top of each other, rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other -- \nEach jamming their gun tight to the other's head. \nThey freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting, Agent Smith machine-calm. \nAgent Smith smiles. \nAGENT SMITH You're empty. \nNeo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK. \nNEO So are you. \nThe smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER. \nCLICK. \nAgent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo retreating as -- \nA knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him slamming back against a steel column. \nStunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel. \nBehind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck- snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue. \nAGENT SMITH You can't win. \nNEO I already have. \nHe attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening. \nAnd this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers. \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nTrinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing blood, his life signs going wild. \nTRINITY Jesus, he's killing him! \nINT.  \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air, hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel, where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail. \nThe keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit. Trinity screams into the headset. \nTRINITY Neo, you better get your ass back here! \nINT.  CAR \nNEO I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying. \nTANK (V.O.) I got one! \nNeo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves, slamming into him. \nTANK (V.O.) Wabash and Lake.  A hotel. \nNeo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the car up over the median. \nTANK (V.O.) Room 303. \nNeo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing lane -- \nDirectly into the charging path of an enormous truck driven by Agent Smith. \nNeo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it, rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other cars, as it EXPLODES. \nNeo is up and running even as orange and black clouds billow up behind hin. \nEXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nThree figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become the three agents. \nFurther down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding ass. \nAgents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore. \nNeo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called: the Heart of Chicago Hotel. \nOnly Agent Jones is behind him now. \nNeo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins to climb. \nINT.  SEWER MAIN \nSentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as they ready their weapons, swarming around the Nebuchadnezzar. \nINT.

ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY \nThe agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor platform. \nNeo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The doors count backwards:  310...  309... \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nMorpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.

HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nNeo can hear the PHONE RINGING. \nAgent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to find -- \nAgent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked. \nNeo can't move -- can't think -- \nBOOM. \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nNeo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life monitors snap flat-line. \nTrinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief. \nINT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY \nThree holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper. \nAgent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no chances. \nAGENT SMITH Check him. \nINT.  HOVERCRAFT \nThrough the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes in their armored housings. \n", "test1_input": "MORPHEUS (V.O.) Outside, there's a scaffold.  You can use it to get to the roof. \nLeaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is several offices away. \nNEO No! It's too far away. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it. \nNeo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm. \nNEO No way, no way, this is crazy. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo.  There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold.  The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you. \nCLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at the scaffold. \nNEO This is insane!  Why is this happening to me?  What did I do? I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck! \nHe climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the frame, he steps onto the small ledge. \nThe scaffold seems even farther away. \nNEO I'm going to die. \nThe WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand. \nHe watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him. \nNEO This is insane.  I can't do this! Forget it! \nHe climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door. \nNEO I didn't do anything! \nEXT.  SKYSCRAPER \nThe agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan. \nTrinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle. \nTRINITY Shit. \nINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR \nA wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at a table alone. \nWe MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the monitor were a window. \nAt the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter. \nSmith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope slaps down on the table between them. \nNeo glances at the name on the file: \"Anderson, Thomas A.\" \nAGENT SMITH As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. \nHe opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at the file or at him. \nAGENT SMITH It seems that you have been living two lives.  In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company.  You have a social security number, you pay your taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage. \nThe pages continue to turn. \nAGENT SMITH The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for, including the unauthorized use of the D.M.V. system for the removal of automobile boots. \nNeo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit. \nAGENT SMITH One of these,lives has a future. One of them does not. \nHe closes the file. \nAGENT SMITH I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are here because we need your help. \nHe removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice- blue. \nAGENT SMITH We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.  He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. \nHe leans closer. \nAGENT SMITH My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing.  It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future.  That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life. \nNeo tries to match his stare. \nAGENT SMITH We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice. \nNeo nods to himself. \nNEO Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a real good deal.  But I think I have a better one.  How about I give you the finger -- \nHe does. \nNEO And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter. \nAgent Smith puts his glasses back on. \nAGENT SMITH You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson. \nNEO You ain't seen nothing yet. \nAGENT SMITH The irony of your situation is that you have no choice. \nNEO You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.  I know my rights. I want my phone call. \nAgent Smith smiles. \n", "test1_true": "The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to feel the muscles in his jaw tighten. \nThe standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic. \nNeo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his mouth is gone. \nWild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair. \nAGENT SMITH You are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or not. \nSmith nods and the other two rip open his shirt. \nFrom a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long, fiber-optic wire tap. \nNeo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the electronic device animates, become an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm. \nThin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord -- \nBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it worms its way inside. \nINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nScreaming, Neo bolts upright in bed. \nHe realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a deep, everything-is-okay breath, when -- \nThe PHONE RINGS. \nIt almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force. \nHe answers it, saying nothing. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.). This line is tapped, so I must be brief. \nNEO The agents -- \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead. \nNeo feels sick. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) I don't know what you are thinking right now but I want you to understand that I will not give up on you until you give up on me. \nNeo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Do you still want to meet? \nNEO ... Yes. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) Take the Howard line south. \nCLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done. \nEXT.  EL TRAIN \nAn EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails. \nINT.  TRAIN \nIt is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching everything nervously. \nThere is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as the door is opened. \nNeo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC and he walks straight at Neo. \nAPOC Come with me. \nNeo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and two police officers rush in, drawing their guns. \nApoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There is no upcoming station. \nApoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo slams against the metal rail. \nThe doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his balance, Apoc shoves him backwards -- \nHe flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls from, the raised tracks -- \nHurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, a truck races under him and -- \nHe crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty boxes. \nINT.  TRUCK BED \nStill shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is next to him, talking into a cellular phone. \nTRINITY We got him.  Call the chop-shop. \nShe hangs up. \nTRINITY Listen to me, Neo.  You have to, trust us. \nShe tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches for his face. \nNEO What are you doing? \nTRINITY This has to be done for your protection and ours. \nShe seals his eyes shut with the tape. \nTRINITY You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us, you're one of them. \nEXT.

APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY \nTrinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until -- \nCYPHER (V.O.) Hello, Trinity. \nTRINITY Cypher?  Where's Tank? \nCYPHER (V.O.) He had an accident. \nTRINITY An accident?  What about Dozer? Is Dozer there? \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nHe walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it hanging in its coma-like stillness. \nCYPHER You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you, Trinity.  I used to dream about you... \nHe nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of it. \nCYPHER You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this. \nWe INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main deck. \nTRINITY You killed them. \nAPOC What?! \nSWITCH Oh God. \nWearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the silent bodies. \nCYPHER In a way you're very lucky.  Most people never know why they die. One minute they're alive, the next they're dead.  No warning. Nothing.  That's why I thought maybe I should tell you.  It seemed the least I could do. \nHe stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils up out of him. \nCYPHER You see, the truth, the real,truth is that the war is over.  It's been over for a long time.  And guess what?  We lost!  Did you hear that?  We lost the war! \nTRINITY What about Zion? \nCYPHER Zion?  Zion is a part of this delusion.  More of this madness. That's why this has to be done. It has to end.  Now and forever. \nShe suddenly sees the entire dark plan. \nTRINITY Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion. You gave them Morpheus for the access codes to Zion. \nCypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to Apoc's body. \nCYPHER You see, Trinity, we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here.  It's in the Matrix. \nTRINITY The Matrix isn't real! \nCYPHER Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die. \nHe grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and yanks it out. \nCYPHER You tell me which is more real. \nApoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then falls dead.  Switch screams. \nCYPHER Welcome to the real world, right? \nHe laughs. \nTRINITY Somehow, some way, you're going to pay for this. \nCYPHER Pay for it?  I'm not even going to remember it.  It'll be like it never happened.  The tree falling in the forest.  It doesn't make a sound. \nHis hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes hold of her plug. \nShe suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered. \nTRINITY Goddamn you, Cypher! \nCYPHER Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove that the message is true. \nHe stands over Neo. \nCYPHER If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug, is there? \nShe turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next. \nCYPHER If he is the One, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me. Because if he dies like the others that means Morpheus was wrong. How can he be the One if he's dead? \nHe takes hold of the cord when -- \nShe hears an EXPLOSION and a scream. \nCypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and the sights of the plasma rifle. \nTANK How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing you're about to die? \nNEO It's Tank!  He's alive. \nCypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head off. \nINT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY \nThey're both listening, trying to figure out what is happening when the store PHONE starts to RING. \nTrinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws his arms around her.

NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY \nA Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago. \nA military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily armed Marines begin to deploy. \nAgent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by columns of Marines.

PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nInside, he finds Agent Smith. \nAGENT JONES There is a problem.  Reagan has failed to secure the hardware. \nAgent Smith stares out the window. \nAGENT SMITH Never send a human to do a machine's job. \nAGENT JONES But if Reagan has failed, why haven't they pulled the plug? \nAGENT SMITH Haven't you learned by now, that it is impossible to understand why they do the things they do? \nHe turns. \nAGENT SMITH Continue as planned.  Trace his signal to locate their position and deploy an extermination unit. \nMorpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked up to various monitors with white disk electrodes. \nAgent Brown begins running a trace program. \nINT.  MAIN DECK \nNeo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold sweat. \nNEO What are they doing to him? \nTANK They're cracking his mind. \nNEO How? \nTANK They inject virus-like serums to break down the system.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time. \nNEO How much time? \nTANK Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this. \nTank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit. The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical one. \nTANK When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know. \nNEO The access codes to Zion. \nTANK If an agent got inside Zion's mainframe he could do anything. Disable the defense system. It would be the end of us. \nHe looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly. \nTANK We can't let that happen.  We have to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be protected. \nTrinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and she starts kicking hin. \nTRINITY Goddamnit!  Goddamnit! \nTANK We have to pull the plug. \nTRINITY No! \nTANK We don't have any other choice. \nThose words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She walks past him and gets into her chair. \nTANK Trinity, what are you doing? \nTRINITY I'm going in after him. \nTANK Morpheus could conform at any minute -- \nTRINITY If he does I'm sure you'll do what has to be done. \n", "test2_id": 823, "test3_input": "TANK You saw that place.

PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite, staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering with brilliant sunlight. \nAGENT SMITH Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of people just living out their lives... oblivious. \nAgent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a hypodermic needle. \nAGENT SMITH Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?  Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.  No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost. \nAgent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and plunges down. \nAGENT SMITH Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.  But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. \nAgent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react violently to the injection. \nAGENT SMITH The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.  Which is why the Matrix was re-designed to this:  the peak of your civilization. \nHe turns from the window. \nAGENT SMITH I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about. \nHe sits down directly in front of Morpheus. \nAGENT SMITH Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution. \nHe lifts Morpheus' head. \nAGENT SMITH Like the dinosaur.  Look out that window.

MAIN DECK \nNeo goes to his chair and begins strapping in. \nTRINITY What do you think you're doing? \nNEO You need help.  I'm coming with you. \nTRINITY No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape. There's no way you're going back in. \nNEO Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something that I'm not. \nTRINITY What? \nNEO I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle told me. \nTrinity is stunned. \nNEO She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn.  She told me maybe next life. \nTRINITY Did you tell Morpheus? \nNEO Why?  It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted to believe.  But Morpheus is the one that matters.  He's more important than me and we both know it. \nHe straps in. \nNEO I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help him, then I'm not even what I think I am. \nTRINITY What are you? \nNEO His friend. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is hunched over, his body leaking and twitching. \nAGENT SMITH I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species.  I've realized that you are not actually mammals. \nThe life signs continue their chaotic patterns. \nAGENT SMITH Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.  But you humans do not.  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. \nHe leans forward. \nAGENT SMITH There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.  Do you know what it is? A virus. \nHe smiles. \nAGENT SMITH Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.  You are a plague.  And we are... the cure. \nINT.

He's resisting. \nAGENT BROWN How? \nAGENT SMITH I don't know.  If I knew... \nAgent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to agents. \nAGENT SMITH Leave me with him. \nAgent Brown and Jones look at each other. \nAGENT SMITH Now! \nINT.

NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY \nA dark wind blows. \nINT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY \nIn long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the revolving doors. \nNeo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances. \nDark glasses, game faces. \nSeveral plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED WHISTLE of THROWING STARS. \nThe cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and Trinity do not even break stride. \nINT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY \nAgent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him. \nAGENT SMITH Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm going to be honest with you. \nHe removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his shoulder. \nAGENT SMITH I hate this place.  This zoo. This prison.  This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell, if there is such a thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it. \nHe wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose. \nAGENT SMITH Repulsive, isn't it? \nHe lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both hands. \nAGENT SMITH I must get out of here, I must get free.  In this mind is tlie key. My key. \nMorpheus sneers through his pain. \nAGENT SMITH Once Zion is gone, there's no need for me to be here.  Do you understand?  I need the codes.  I have to get inside Zion.  You have to tell me how. \nHe begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh. \nAGENT SMITH Tell me!  Tell me! \nThe skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus. \nAGENT BROWN What were you doing? \nAgent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece. \nAGENT JONES You don't know. \nAGENT SMITH Know what? \nAgent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what he is hearing. \nINT.

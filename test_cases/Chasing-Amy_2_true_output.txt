She hits him with her pillow. 
THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS 
1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the picture.  Alyssa gave him. It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to her and shakes his head 'no'. 
2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look. Alyssa sticks her tongue at him. 
3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the tape herself, 
4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face. He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs. 
5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden again, this time with the painting hung completely upside down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze. 
6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging out with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up and throws it across the room. 
7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop. She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, eating her out (no, we don't see anything!). 
INT OFFICE - DAY 
Holden draws.  A book is thrown in front of him.  He looks up.  Banky stands there. 
BANKY Check out page forty eight. 
Holden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty Eight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head at Banky and flips it open. 
On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'. 
HOLDEN (looking up) So? 
BANKY Did you see the nickname? 
HOLDEN 'Finger Cuffs'. 
BANKY And...? 
HOLDEN And... she had a weird nick-name. What's your point? 
BANKY Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'? 
HOLDEN I suppose you do. 
BANKY I do. (takes a seat) You remember Cohee Lundin?  Left Hudson and went to North our senior year? 
HOLDEN Yeah. 
BANKY Well, I ran into him at Food City the other day, and we got to talking, and I mentioned that you were dating Alyssa, and he said.. 
CUT TO COHEE LUNDON.  In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY, addressing the camera. 
COHEE Alyssa Jones?  Shit.  I know Alyssa Jones.  I mean, I know Alyssa Jones, you know what I'm saying? Me and Rick Derris used to hang our with her for awhile, right?  Just hanging around her house after school, 'cuz her parents were like never home, and shit.  And one day, Rick just whips it out, and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit; chasing her around the living room - I was dying.  But you know what the crazy bitch did? She fucking drops to her knees, and just starts sucking him off right in front of me!  Like I wasn't even there man!  I almost died!  But that's not the fucked up part - the fucked up part was Rick, man - right in the middle of it, he turns to me and he's pointing at her and he says "Cohee." Just like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like I'll give it a shot.  And I start pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz I figure any second she's gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, right?  But yo, check this shit out - she's all into it man!  She don't try to stop me or nothing!  She's all wet and shit, and I just went to work, know what I'm saying?  Me and Rick are going to town on this crazy bitch, and she's just loving it, all moaning and shit!  It was fucked up! So Rick's the one that came up with the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had us locked in tight from both sides - like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger cuffs! 
BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky. 
HOLDEN He's full of shit. 
BANKY Cohee's a lot of things, but an exxagerator he's not.  The dude's Catholic. 
HOLDEN She's never even been with a guy.

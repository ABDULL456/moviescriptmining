AIBILEEN (CONT'D) God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me. He was just twenty-four years old. The best part of a person's life. 
SKEETER Oh, Aibileen. 
AIBILEEN But he'd like we's doing this. He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day...After my prayers last night, I got some stories down too. Skeeter nods. Aibileen opens her notebook and reads. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just turned fourteen years old. Daddy had left us, so I dropped out a school to help momma with the bills. 
INT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MORNING 
A congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the large choir. Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her ear. Yule suddenly leans back, shocked, shaking her head "no." Minny watches from two pews back. Her curiosity is peaked. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Alton's momma died a lung disease. I loved that baby, and he loved me. That's when I learned I could make children feel proud of theyselves. 
INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK 
Miss Stein sits at her desk reading Aibileen's stories. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) Alton used to always be asking me how come I's black... 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
AIBILEEN It just ate him up, so one time I told him it cause I drank too much coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen his face. 
Skeeter laughs as she writes down Aibileen's story. 
SKEETER This is great. You have no idea how much I appreciate this...But I just have to ask. What changed your mind? 
AIBILEEN 
(WITHOUT PAUSE) Miss Hilly Holbrook. 
INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING 
Hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel. The pleats of her navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion. A room full of JUNIOR LEAGUE MEMBERS sits up and quiets down. Half the girls are pregnant and most all drink TAB and are smoking. Skeeter sits in the back next to Elizabeth. 
HILLY We're running behind on our "coat drive," girls. So hurry up and clean out those closets...But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots. The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Y'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year? More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly beams. Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Now for some exciting news...I wanted y'all to be the first to know...My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November! Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up. 
HILLY (CONT'D) He's runnin' on a platform of health. Protecting our children. Protecting our way of life. So, I, with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative. This sets off a room of whispers. 
HILLY (CONT'D) Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? I gave it to you a month ago. Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics. 
ELIZABETH I gave that to you myself! 
SKEETER I, ah...Well, I- 
HILLY Would you please stand, Skeeter? As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads. 
SKEETER I'll have it in there soon. Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel. 
EXT. LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY 
Skeeter turns a corner and sees Hilly leaning on her car. 
SKEETER Hilly? Do you need a ride? Hilly shakes her head with little emotion. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) I'm sorry about the newsletter. Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) With Momma being sick and- Hilly erupts with excitement. 
HILLY He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time. This Saturday night. 
SKEETER Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before. Maybe it's a sign. 
HILLY Don't you dare say that! 
SKEETER You know I won't be his type. Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders. 
HILLY It's your time, Skeeter. And damnit, I'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him. 
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Minny is again wearing her maid's uniform. She puts two plates of food down on the kitchen table. She sits next to her daughter, SUGAR, 15. Sugar wears a brand-spanking-new maids's uniform. 
MINNY Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like to not feed ya on try-out day. Sugar takes a bite of toast. 
MINNY (CONT'D) I still say you're too young to be waitin' on white peoples...Now, Sugar, I want you to listen to me, and you listen to me good. Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes. 
MINNY (CONT'D) These are the rules for working in a white lady's house. Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out. 
MINNY (CONT'D) Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet. Sugar nods.

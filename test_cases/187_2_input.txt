Trevor eyes them, finds what he was looking for in the book... 
TREVOR (addressing class) Since some of you seem to have an interest in anesthetics, I've prepared a little demonstration. 
Glances over at Rita now.    Checks the wall clock. 
TREVOR Rita, bring your friend in the cage over here, please. 
Bringing the cage over... 
RITA His name's Snowball. Like 'dat lil' pig dude from Animal Farm. 
TREVOR (coolly impressed) You've read Animal Farm? 
CESAR (above the din) ... schoolgirl. 
RITA (snapping a look) Shut up, Cesar. 
TREVOR You read Animal Farm, Cesar? 
CESAR No, but I fucked a sheep. 
Stevie and Paco love it. 
TREVOR Cesar, come up here. (gesturing) I want you to have a front row seat for this. 
Surprisingly, Cesar does what he's told as Trevor removes an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next to Snowball's cage...

TREVOR And remove the 'lokes.' 
Cesar removes his dark glasses.       His eyes are bloodshot and vapid. 
TREVOR Why your eyes so red? 
CESAR (lying) Mus' be pink-eye, sir. 
CESAR (eyes Trevor's pocket watch) Nice watch, homes. Can I have it? 
Disregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box. He puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer. 
TREVOR (pointing) Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there? 
She does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish. 
TREVOR (referring to text) Cesar, read Young's rule for us. Page 564. At the top. 
CESAR (like it's above him) I ain't gonna read 'dat shit. 
TREVOR Rita, give Cesar your book.    Let 'im read. 
Rita places her book on Cesar's desk. 
CESAR Forget it. 
Jeers from the class, "Come on, read".       "Hurry up, Cesar." 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                     53 
TREVOR (prompting him) 'Young's rule...' Go on. 
Rita points to the passage in the book.        Cesar slaps her hand. 
RITA (reacting) ... Chunt. (Choont.) 
CESAR Stoopit bitch. 
TREVOR Touch her again, Cesar, and you'll answer to me personally. 
Rita knits her eyebrows at Trevor.        Cesar laughs. 
CESAR You like her, Mr. G? 
Class erupts. 
RITA (shrinking) Shut up! 
TREVOR (genuinely) Settle down, everyone. We all have to learn how to forgive and get along. C'mon, Cesar, read. Please. 
At first Cesar doesn't budge.         Now grudgingly he looks down at the book... 
CESAR (attempting to read) ... Young's rule... ff... fo... 
TREVOR ... Formulates. 
Cesar heaves the book across the room: Class erupts, "Refer 'im," "Send 'im tuh Hyland." Trevor walks over and picks up the book. Class now settles. Watches Trevor closely to see what he's going to do. Trevor gazes at Cesar...

TREVOR ... I say everyone deserves another chance. Whadda you say, Cesar?

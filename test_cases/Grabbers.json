OCEAN - NIGHT \nAcross the inky swell, a river of moonlight cuts a path to a lonely fishing tug drifting with the tide. THE MERRY WIDOW. \nINT. MERRY WIDOW GALLEY - NIGHT \nA light bulb waltzes with the sway of the boat. Three shabby Irish fishermen unwind after dinner, playing cards. \nThe eldest and scruffiest (the SKIPPER) reveals his hand to a young deckhand (GREG). Read 'em and weep. \nGREG You can't be serious? \nLaughing, the Skipper unspools himself from the cramped table as he and ROY, the bloated first-mate, clamber above deck. \nGREG Every bloody night. \nEXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nRoy and the Skipper check the hauled in nets, until ... \nA SILENT ARC OF LIGHT SLICES ACROSS THE SKY.     It careens downwards in a furious trajectory and -- \nBOOM!!   A mile off their port it collides with the sea. \nROY Did you see that? \nSKIPPER ... Yeah. \nROY A flare? \nThe Skipper watches the water.     Unsure. \nGreg leaps on deck brandishing a clutch of cards. \nGREG Ye cheated! There's five aces!    I counted 'em! \nThe Skipper brushes past Greg, distracted. \nSKIPPER Secure the lines. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          2. \nGreg looks to Roy. \nGREG Not so funny now, huh? \nRoy plucks one of the five aces from Greg's hand and flips it over. Its backing is red. \nROY It's from a different deck, ya muppet. \nHe sticks it to Greg's damp forehead and carries on as ordered. Greg turns the remaining aces over. They're blue. \nGREG ... Shite. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT \nFoam rises as bubbles crest violently. Closing in, the Merry Widow casts its searchlight across the churning surf. \nINT. PILOTHOUSE / EXT. OCEAN \nThe Skipper steers carefully, holding a radio mic. \nSKIPPER (INTO MIC) Haven Point. Haven Point. Haven Point. This is Fishing tug Merry Widow. Call sign echo whiskey niner ait fife. Position five nautical miles west of Erin Island. Responding to unknown distress flare. Over. \nThe Skipper pulls back on the throttle, sloshing to a stop. \nHe taps the sonar screen.     A hazy shadow engulfs the readout. \nSKIPPER Definitely something ... \nCOASTGUARD (O.S.) Hold your position, Merry Widow, rescue chopper on its way. Over. \nGreg drops the mic and edges outside. \nEXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nThe deck swims with water.      Greg holds his breath, listening. \nGREG Skipper? \nThe abandoned C.B. mic swings to and fro.        Almost playfully. \nCOASTGUARD (O.S.) Merry Widow, how many aboard? Over. \nGreg rounds the pilothouse, breathing heavily. \nSuddenly what looks like a weird, headless black snake feels its way towards his boots. Greg turns and bolts. \nHe scrambles to the stern amongst the nets and snatches a gutting-knife with both hands. \nTrapped against the rail, panting, he prays for help but -- \n-- HE'S DRAGGED OVERBOARD.      His legs round in the air as he cascades into the sea. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT \nJust beyond the Merry Widow, he surfaces gasping. \nGREG Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.   Oh Jes-- \nHe's gone. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       6. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT \nIn the moonlight the isolated Merry Widow reposes mournfully. \nG   R   A   B   B   E   R   S \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nCIAR\u00c1N O'SHEA lies face down on a sofa. His bed for the night. He gropes a dry bottle of whiskey as a mobile phone RINGS. He stirs awake. It's no surprise he looks like shite, but to be fair he's not bad looking after a wash. \nO'SHEA Uh ... Yeah? \nSomeone we'll meet later as SGT KENIFICK replies. \nKENIFICK'S VOICE (via speaker phone) O'Shea, I take it you've left already because if you haven't, you're late. That ferry gets in at nine. \nO'Shea rises, eyes closed.       Mouth dry. \nKENIFICK'S VOICE Where are you? \nO'SHEA ... On the way. \nKENIFICK'S VOICE So you're in the car? \nO'SHEA ... Yeah ... \nKENIFICK'S VOICE So you're driving while on the phone?! \nO'SHEA ... No. \nKENIFICK'S VOICE In the name of God, I don't b-- \nO'Shea hangs up and drops his whiskey bottle in a bin where it CLATTERS with yesterday's bottle, and the day before's. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          7. \nEXT. O'SHEA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nAn isolated house at the foothills of a mountain.    A white Garda patrol jeep leaves the scene and -- \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - MORNING \n-- rambles along the sunny coast.   At the wheel, O'Shea is a very hungover, droopy eyed Garda. \nEXT. ERIN ISLAND - MORNING \nLush green hills and whitewashed bungalows, pastel beaches and multi-coloured fishing boats. Enchanting. \nEXT. MARINA FERRY DOCK - DAY \nColourful crowds of FAMILIES (TEENS, KIDS, PARENTS) file onto the MAINLAND FERRY as it lies moored in the harbour. \nGARDA LISA NOLAN hustles through the masses dragging a trolley bag and passing a sign that reads: \nOILE\u00c1N \u00c9IRINN, C\u00c9AD M\u00cdLE F\u00c1ILTE Welcome to Erin Island \nLisa opens a map and wrestles with it in the wind.   Soon defeated, it blows out of her hands. \nLISA I'll take it black, thanks. \nKenifick's mobile RINGS and he silences it. \nKENIFICK So you can have my desk while I'm gone. O'Shea will tell you, 'tis mostly administrative, processing permits and that sort. You might catch the odd bit of commotion every now and then but half the island's leaving for the show in Dungary so it'll be dead all weekend. \nLISA I'm sure we can find something to do. \nO'Shea rolls his eyes and passes Lisa her coffee. \nLISA Ta. \nShe takes it and sits at her desk, feeling her surroundings. \nO'SHEA (whispered to Kenifick) Is she really necessary? \nKENIFICK You tell me. \nLisa carefully arranges her desk how she likes it.     Neat. \nO'SHEA You're only gone two weeks.      I can handle two weeks. \nKENIFICK You could.     But you wouldn't. \nKenifick's mobile PINGS.      He checks the text message. \nKENIFICK Don't be late, I said.      What did I say? \nHis phone RINGS again. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          11. \nKENIFICK I'm coming, I'm coming.    Right, I'm off. \nLISA Not a bother. \nKENIFICK Rightio. Reports and files in the top drawer, anything you need, O'Shea will be here to show you round. O'Shea? \nO'SHEA You're gonna miss your boat. \nKENIFICK Sl\u00e1n. \nKenifick leaves. An uncomfortable silence fills the air like two strangers in an elevator. Lisa sips her coffee. Hates it. O'Shea slumps at his desk, throws his feet up and sighs. \nKenifick barges back in and O'Shea falls over himself to straighten up, burning himself with his coffee. \nKENIFICK Won't go far with no tickets.    See you in a fortnight. Be good. \nHe snatches them and leaves. O'Shea recovers and notices Lisa stifling a smile. The office phone RINGS and O'Shea sluggishly reaches for it. But Lisa beats him to it. \nLISA Garda Nolan. \nEXT. FISHING PORT (BY MAHER'S PUB) - DAY \nAt the dock PADDY BARRETT sorts his lobster traps.   All he's short is a parrot and a wooden leg. \nHis traps appear empty, some mangled, but before he can protest one of the oblong traps leaps. He watches it and like a magic trick it leaps again. \nHe squats down and gazes between the seaweed strewn cage. Nothing to be seen thanks to the seaweed. He prods it and lo, it shifts violently. Hopping mad. \nPaddy rises, wipes his frowning forehead with his cap and gestures to a fisherman packing ice crates on the dock. \nTADHG MURPHY saunters over.    An alpha male in a beta body. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            12. \nPADDY Take a look at this. \nPaddy gently kicks the lobster trap, spurring it. On cue, it haphazardly jumps across the wet dock. Tadhg snickers. \nTADHG He's a biggun. \nPADDY He's not a lobster. \nTADHG Then what is it? \nPaddy shrugs.   Tadhg kneels down and peers inside. \nSPLAT! A GEYSER OF GOO SPRAYS IN HIS FACE!        Tadhg staggers to his feet, spitting furiously. \nTADHG Oh ya bastard, Paddy!      Ya knew it was gonna do that. \nPADDY I didn't.    On me life. \nTadhg wipes away the slime with his sweater. \nTADHG Eurgh, the smell. \nPADDY So what is it? \nTADHG I dunno, it's a feckin octopus or something, it's covered in seaweed. But 'tis no feckin' lobster! \nSMITH (writing in a pad) One second. \nLisa's eyes light up at Smith's dismissal of O'Shea. A kindred spirit. Once Smith's ready, he ignores O'Shea and removes a glove to shake Lisa's hand. So very English. \nSMITH Smith. \nLISA Lisa. \nO'Shea stares at her.   Typical. \nO'SHEA Smith's a marine psychologist or something, did I get that right? \nSMITH No.   It's marine ecology. \nO'Shea shrugs, whatever. \nLISA That was quick. \nSMITH More fortunate really. I'm based here doing studies for the department of the marine. \nSmith hands O'Shea the tip of a tape measure. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       16. \nSMITH Hold this, please. \nO'Shea doesn't have a choice. Smith walks the length of the whales, stepping around Lisa and touching her as he goes. \nSMITH So how long are you here? \nLISA Two weeks. \nSMITH Oh, wonderful. Wonderful.   Are you staying nearby? \nO'Shea interrupts, deliberately: \nO'SHEA So are they dead?! \nSMITH Hmm?   No, they're just sleeping. \nSmith and Lisa share a smirk. O'Shea notices and lets the tape measure go, snapping back on Smith's fingers. Ouch. \nO'SHEA Slipped. \nO'Shea and Smith trade looks. \nLISA So what happened? \nSMITH Well they're pilot whales. It happens with them from time to time but no one really knows why. \nLisa notes deep spider-vein gashes on the whales' bodies as if they were whipped with a huge cat-o'-nine-tails. \nLISA What are those marks? \nSMITH Not sure. Possible scratches off the rocks while washing up here. \nLISA They didn't beach themselves? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            17. \nSMITH No, they died at sea. \nO'SHEA All of them? At once? \nSMITH It's a strange one all right. \nO'Shea considers the ocean before him. \nEXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - DAY \nA charming little shithole. \nINT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - DAY \nPaddy kicks open the bathroom door.   He plugs the bathtub and lets the tap run, filling it. \nHe shuffles out and returns wearing a welders mask and dragging the lobster trap. He lifts the trap over the bath rim and drops it into the bath water where it BUBBLES. \nHe removes his mask and peers in at it.   What the feck? \nEXT. DERELICT SITE - DAY \nA dilapidated mill, long since operational. A sign reads \"KEEP OUT\".   The jeep pulls up and O'Shea and Lisa step out. \nO'SHEA Hey, Daly, Cooney about? \nOn the rim of a demolished \"pit\" DALY points to a ramp. Years of labouring have turned Daly into one big freckle. O'Shea follows Daly's directions up a ramp towards the demolished frame of a building. \nDaly elbows his MATE, ogling Lisa. \nDALY Now that is one arresting woman. \nO'Shea leans on the counter, a whiskey before him. Avuncular proprietor BRIAN MAHER watches from behind the counter. \nON A PUB TV: the white helicopter of the Coastguard circles the Merry Widow boat. Footage taken earlier in the day. \nRTE REPORTER (V.O.) (over TV images) -- search and rescue was called off as a search and recover operation became priority. A telling sign that the missing fishermen are believed to have perished. \nLisa approaches the counter/reception and hands Brian a key. \nLISA Hi, do you have an iron? \nBRIAN We do indeed. \nBrian moves to get it and Lisa spots O'Shea, throwing her. Shoeless, she rises up on her toes. Gaining two inches. \nLISA Hi. \nAn awkward silence. \nO'SHEA Would you like a drink? \nUNA MAHER eavesdrops while wiping the counter.   Una has a face you could confide in, but shouldn't. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       21. \nLISA Another time, maybe. \nBrian hands Lisa the iron. \nLISA Thanks. (TO O'SHEA) See you tomorrow. \nO'SHEA Tomorrow's Sunday. \nLISA Oh, right. Well, I have a key so ... see you Monday then. \nShe walks off and Una moves in, wiping under O'Shea's drink. \nUNA Sparks flying there, huh. \nO'SHEA What? \nUNA Do you like her? \nO'SHEA She's all right. A bit uptight. \nUNA You should talk to her. \nO'SHEA I do talk to her.    I talked to her all day. \nUNA God, ye're all the same. \nBRIAN Ah leave him off, Una. \nUNA Listen to you. (to O'Shea; about Brian) Eight years I was waiting for him to get down on his knee. Have ya ever heard the like of it? My family thought I was mad wasting me time on him. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          22. \nBRIAN Ah feck them. \nUNA Ah feck you, Brian. \nUna shuffles off. \nBRIAN Same again? \nO'SHEA Go on. \nBRIAN I tell you what though if I weren't, you know, I'd be up them stairs like a shot. \nBrian feels Una's stare from across the bar.    He smiles at her, placating. \nGrinning to himself at the far end of the counter, Paddy fixes O'Shea's stare. \nO'SHEA What is it, Paddy? \nPADDY Wouldn't you like to know? \nO'SHEA No, not really. \nO'Shea turns back to his drink. \nPADDY But you would, though. \nO'SHEA Nope. \nPADDY You would! If you were to know what I know you'd want to know. \nO'SHEA All right, tell us then. \nPaddy shuffles closer, all excited. \nPADDY Right, between you and me, I caught meself a sea monster today. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011   23. \nO'Shea changes weight to his other leg and accidentally kicks over Lisa's side-table. \nO'SHEA Feck. \nIt clatters to the floor, knocking her toiletries over. \nO'SHEA Sorry. \nLISA It's OK. \nHe helps her pick them up -- \nO'SHEA (notices a 'Stress Ball') What's that? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        26. \nLisa grabs it off him, mortified as he rises with a headrush. \nO'SHEA Whoa, that last drink's gone straight to me head. \nLISA Just your head? \nO'SHEA Well, other places too. \nO'Shea grins suggestively, reading her wrong. \nLISA Do you get this drunk every night? \nO'SHEA Just high days and holidays. \nO'Shea rests against the wall.       Eyes drooping. \nLISA Let's get you to bed. \nO'SHEA Now you're talking. \nEXT. GARDEN PATH - NIGHT \nPaddy crashes his bicycle into a fence and staggers in the gate, mumbling something about bastards and fences. \nINT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaddy pours himself a drink of what looks like homemade potcheen. Still muttering. \nTHUD!    The bathroom door rattles.    He looks at it, wide-eyed. \nINT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe door yawns opens and Paddy creeps in, wearing his welders mask. He gazes into the tub and removes his mask. There just as he left it is the lobster trap, but it's BROKEN. \nPaddy leans down and checks the trap as behind him reflected through the slimy residue of his bathroom cabinet's mirror something black and slithery crawls up the wall behind him. \nWe see it but Paddy doesn't until a HISS. Paddy turns and the GRABBER spits a barbed tongue and whips itself onto his face. Paddy slams against the bathroom mirror, as if leveled by a punch. The mirror shatters, obscuring the scuffle. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         27. \nPaddy tears it off his face, gasping and flings it away. Blood seeps from a three point puncture wound on his neck. \nPADDY You dirty ... \nPaddy stamps on it, whatever it is. Again and again, until out of breath, he staggers from the bathroom. A moment later he returns with a standing lamp and continues beating it. Over and over and over until he's exhausted. \nPADDY Bastard. \nEXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nThe warm glow of light from within would attract every moth within a mile if it were a dry Summer's night, but it's not. It's raining and it's attracting something far more sinister. \nINT. BEDROOM / BUNGALOW - NIGHT \nIRENE MURPHY, cocooned in a bathrobe and slippers, snatches a pair of socks and a sweater off the floor. Muttering, she sniffs the sweater and recoils. It reeks. \nOn a mission she marches through the open plan home passing Fisherman Tadhg gazing at the TV. \nIRENE Tadhg, you're stinking. Would you get in the bath already, I can smell you from here. \nTADHG I'm watching this. \nIRENE (TO HERSELF) What were you doing at all today? \nIrene enters the kitchen -- \nEXT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \n-- and dumps it in a wash basket for tomorrow's load -- \nA BANG against the window. Irene startles. She leans, hands cupped around her eyes pressed up against the glass, staring out into the darkness. Any second now she's going to be pulled through ... only not. She tightens her robe instead. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011     28. \nIRENE (TO HERSELF) God, 'tis blowing a gale out. \nTADHG (O.S.) What? \nA WEIRD, PITCHED ROAR takes Irene's breath away.    Whatever snatched Tadhg sounds unnatural, huge and mean. \nSoot tumbles down the chimney drawing Irene's attention. \nShe runs and kneels before the fireplace and receives a blast of black soot to the face. She coughs and sputters and reaches up to close the chimney chute. Fumbling, whimpering. \nINSIDE THE CHIMNEY CHUTE \nSomething descends towards her, gaining speed.   Irene grabs blindly at the clasp ... \nHer eyes dart open. That's not the clasp! She SCREAMS and flies up the chute like a mouse sucked up a hoover. And as her CRIES die out all that's left in the open fireplace is a pair of orphaned fluffy pink slippers. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - MORNING \nLisa DINGS the reception bell.   Una stumbles to her call. \nUNA Good morning. Sleep well? \nLISA Grand, thanks. Do I have something to sign? \nUNA Oh yeah.   The big one. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          31. \nUna grabs her bill and hands it to Lisa. \nLISA How's the weather looking? \nUNA Oh, there's a storm coming. \nLISA Really? Are the gulls flying low or something? \nUNA No, it's on the telly. \nUna gestures to the TV weather report. Lisa smiles.   Of course. She fishes out her credit card. \nUNA So, you're working with O'Shea? \nLISA Temporarily. \nUNA He's a nice fella isn't he?    Quite a catch. \nLISA Depends what you're fishing. \nUna hands Lisa her receipt to sign and watches her writing. \nUNA Single? (off Lisa's nod) So's O'Shea. Well, widowed. \nLisa looks up. \nLISA Widowed? \nUNA Why do you think he's here? Sure there's no want for him round this neck of the woods but I suppose he wanted the peace. Or his superiors thought he did. He doesn't say, God love him. \nLisa smiles uncomfortably and hands her receipt to Una. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        32. \nUNA So will you be sticking to the same room all week? Because we have a few doubles. There's more room in those, you know yourself. \nUna winks knowingly. \nLISA The single room is fine. \nUNA Are you sure now? You never know if you want to stretch your legs later on. Give it a week and we'll be booked solid, so we will. \nLISA I'll think about it. \nLisa hightails it. \nINT. CELL, GARDA STATION - MORNING \nPanned out on a rubber mattress you'd swear O'Shea was dead if he wasn't SNORING like a Granddad. \nThe heavy cell door flies open and SLAMS off the wall.   Lisa stand in the doorway as O'Shea jerks awake. \nLISA Morning. \nO'SHEA Wha..? \nLISA How much does a place like this go for? I mean it's close to the beach, all mod-cons. It's perfect. \nO'SHEA I ... uh, what happened? \nLISA Section four point one of the Public Order Act. It is an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger themselves or any other in the vicinity. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       33. \nO'SHEA You arrested me?! \nLISA For your own good. \nO'SHEA Let me out of here. \nSmith takes hold of its tongue and extends it three foot with a barbed tip like a mace. Off O'Shea and Lisa's awed faces. \nLISA That's not a tongue. \nO'SHEA It's a weapon. \nPADDY It spits like a frog and strangles ya. Whippet fast, and sharp. \nSMITH I'm guessing it bleeds its prey like a leech. Consuming the blood, like some sort of vampiro toothis. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       36. \nO'SHEA Vampiro what? \nSMITH Toothis. It's a rare deep sea squid but this isn't that, not in Irish waters. No, this is something totally different. Something ... alien. (off their looks) In that it's undocumented. \nPADDY It's gotta be worth a fortune. \nSMITH But here's the thing... \nSmith picks up a sponge, daubs it in a tray of water and -- \nSMITH -- When I tried to clean some dirt off of it -- \nPADDY I stood on it a few times. \nSMITH -- this happened -- \n-- he delicately dabs the tip of a tentacle. The Grabber's skin reacts, rehydrating. Smith watches it expectantly. \nSuddenly the tip twitches.    Smith smiles at them. \nSMITH All this thing needs to survive is blood ... and water. \nO'Shea frowns, watching it. \nPADDY Could you put it on the eBay, do ya think? \nSMITH You are not putting this on eBay. You're lucky she didn't kill you. \nO'SHEA She? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           37. \nSMITH Yeah, it's a female from what I can tell. \nPADDY How can you tell? \nSMITH It's got no testicles. \nA long silence, Paddy nods.    I see. \nSMITH And ... she was pregnant. \nHe reveals an EGG SPAWN. Gelatine and gooey. Inside is a baby Grabber; a Jack-in-the-box type creature aka a JUMPER. \nLISA That's disgusting. \nLisa recoils: it stinks.   Smith toys with it, marveling. \nSMITH We're dealing with something extraordinary here. And if it looks like this when it hatches, then this species nests on land. \nO'Shea and Lisa share a look.   Uh oh. \nINT./EXT. PATROL JEEP - DAY \nO'Shea switches gears as they make their way along the coast. \nLISA Do you reckon those things had anything to do with those dead whales? \nO'Shea considers her, thinking. They pass the promenade and O'Shea cranes his head to see something. \nLISA What is it? \nO'SHEA That's Declan Cooney's car. \nEXT. BEACH PROMENADE - DAY \nCooney's car sits abandoned, its door open and airbag flat. O'Shea and Lisa pull in behind it and step out of the jeep. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            38. \nO'SHEA Cooney?! \nO'Shea takes a LEPRECHAUN KEYCHAIN from the ignition, then notes some unusual scratches along the car's body work. \nLISA Where could he be? \nO'SHEA Nowhere without his keys.    Do you believe in coincidences? \nLISA Not really. \nO'SHEA Neither do I. \nLISA Oh the Divine Mother of Jesus -- \nLisa leans sharply out of its way as down below: O'Shea sneaks a sip of his flask. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          41. \nLISA Watch out! \nO'Shea looks up to see \nTADHG'S SEVERED HEAD spinning towards him.    BOP!   Headbutted in the face, O'Shea clutches his nose. \nO'SHEA Aw Jesus Cock! \nLisa looks down at the gawping severed head, sickened. \nLISA You broke its nose. \nINT. DOCTOR'S SURGERY - DAY \nDr Gleeson replaces a sheet over Tadhg's head as Lisa paces on a mobile phone, O'Shea watching. \nO'SHEA What killed him, Jim? \nDR GLEESON The fact he's just a head! \nDr Gleeson turns back, writing. \nDR GLEESON Jesus what do you think? You bring me someone with a head cold or a headache and I could do something. You bring me just a head and you're taking the piss. \nLISA (INTO PHONE) So when can they get here? ... (for O'Shea's benefit) Tomorrow? ... And what about the state pathologist? \nDR GLEESON They could bury him in a shoebox. That's not right. \nLISA (hand over receiver) Doctor, we need to know. \nDR GLEESON I don't know. A tiger? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            42. \nO'SHEA A tiger?! \nLISA I can't say that. \nDr Gleeson loosens his tie. \nDR GLEESON I'm telling you his head was torn off. By something big. \nO'Shea shares a look with Lisa. \nINT. GARDA STATION - DAY \nO'Shea uploads crime scene photos of Tadhg's bungalow onto a laptop as Lisa paces on the phone. \nLISA (INTO PHONE) No, no, don't put me through I've already spoken to -- ugh. Thanks. \nLisa sighs.   She's been at this a while, it seems. \nO'Shea pulls his hip flask from his jacket pocket and furtively sneaks a sip, savouring it. \nPADDY Holy Christ, wait till I tell ya! \nO'Shea chokes on his drink, coughing.     He spins to face Paddy, quickly hiding his flask. \nO'SHEA Jesus, Paddy. \nPADDY What?   What's wrong with ya? \nO'SHEA What is it? \nPADDY Come look for yourself. \nLisa looks at O'Shea.   A silent exchange.   Lisa hangs up. \nINT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - DAY \nA demolished wall offers a new entrance to the backyard, where amongst rubble, Paddy's scratched bathtub lays. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       43. \nPADDY How am I supposed to wash meself? \nO'Shea thinks... \nINT. PADDY'S HOUSE - DAY - SECONDS LATER \nO'Shea unrolls a map of Erin Island on the living room table. He points at four spots on the map. A zig-zag pattern. \nO'SHEA OK, we're here. Here's where Cooney's car was abandoned. Here's Tadhg and Irene Murphy's house and here's where the whales washed up. \nLISA OK, so what does that mean? \nO'Shea stares blankly. \nPADDY We're here. \nEXT. BEACH, CAVE MOUTH - DAY \nThey stand before the cave mouth, taking it in. Dark and oppressive and claustrophobic. Water drips within. A wave washes up behind them, drenching their feet. \nPADDY Tides coming in. Another hour and this place will be under water. \nO'SHEA Wait here. \nPADDY You can be sure of it. \nLisa and O'Shea turn on their high beam flashlights and venture into the cave, Mulder and Scully style. \nWater drips from the cave walls while the sound of crashing waves echoes throughout. \nAt the cave mouth, the dregs of a wave wash over Paddy's boots. He looks into the cave, anxiously. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       47. \nVenturing further into the shadowy cave, Lisa finds an arched entrance to the rising ocean as fog creeps around her feet. \nO'Shea rounds some rocks, finding Lisa and seeing her flashlight has found a fisherman's shredded slicker. (The remains of the Merry Widow's Deckhand Greg.) \nLISA Are we missing some fishermen? \nO'SHEA (CALLS OUT) Hello! \nLisa jolts, startled by O'Shea. \nLISA My heart!    What are you doing? \nO'SHEA Just checking. Well, if you know of a better way? (CALLS AGAIN) Hello?! \nLISA What are you expecting?   \"Helloooo, 'tis only me.\" \nA SHADOW rises up stealing the light. O'Shea and Lisa turn. They lift the flashlights and take in the horrifying sight. \nO'SHEA Run! \nThey take off, running for the slim cave mouth. Their lights dancing in the darkness as they scramble for the exit -- leading onto the beach. The narrow gap allows just one person at a time. And at a push. Lisa edges through first. \nINT./EXT. BEACH CAVE OPENING - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nO'Shea waits behind Lisa, watching behind them, and sees the light of his flashlight go dark, swallowed by something coming his way. \nO'SHEA Lisa!   Hurry! \nLISA I'm trying! \nO'SHEA Move your arse! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         48. \nO'Shea pushes on her arse as she squeezes through. \nLISA Get your hands off my arse! \nO'Shea shoves harder. \nLISA I swear to God, if you don't stop! \nLisa kicks back at him, but he keeps pushing. She tumbles onto the seaweed strewn sands, drenched by the incoming tide, as O'Shea squeezes through next. Soon, wedged in himself. \nO'SHEA If I die in here I want you to know it's all your fault! \nLISA Oh shut up. \nLisa wraps her arms around O'Shea, cheek-to-awkwardly- intimate-cheek and pulls, dragging him loose. With effort. \nThe Grabber rushes towards O'Shea, gaining speed.    Almost on him when he escapes, seconds to spare. \nBAM! The Grabber fills the gap in the rock face, trapped by its own bulk. It snarls as one of its tentacles slithers out towards them, but quickly retreats back inside. \nLISA The size of it. \nThey back up, horrified. \nO'SHEA It's OK. It can't get us on dry land. Not when it's not raining, it can't. \nWHIPAH! A barbed tongue shoots out from the darkness of the cave and lances O'Shea's Garda hat clean off his head. O'Shea blinks, feeling his bare head. \nO'SHEA ... What? \nA THUNDER-CRACK from the ominous rain clouds. \nLISA Leg it! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       49. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nPaddy steps out of the way of an oncoming wave and kicks something with his heel. He kneels down and finds an EGG. \nSMITH OK, it's an alien. \nO'Shea feels his wounds. Furious, he grabs one of the mops surrounding him and jabs at the Grabber with the handle. \nO'SHEA You vicious little fu--! \nThe Grabber bites down on the handle and hangs on. O'Shea suddenly takes the full weight of it. It totters above their heads, swaying. Lisa and Smith duck. \nLISA Ah!    Jesus! O'Shea! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        52. \nO'Shea drops it onto the floor and Lisa yanks a steel cabinet over, pinning it down. Trapped, the Grabber thrashes. \nO'SHEA We need to kill it. \nSMITH No! You can't! It's the scientific discovery of our time, imagine all that we could learn FROM -- \nThe cabinet flips,   exposing the Grabber. Smith SCREAMS and brains it with his   stool. Scared shitless, O'Shea and Lisa pile in with their   boots. All three whacking and stamping until they're sure   it's dead. \nSweating and in shock, they catch their breath. \nSMITH I think we got it. \nO'SHEA (PATS SMITH) Good man. \nO'Shea flicks the Grabber goop out of his hair. \nSMITH It's still moving. \nLISA We need to get help. \nO'SHEA They'll never make it across the water. \nLISA If those eggs hatch, with no whales to eat -- \nSMITH -- they'll head in land to feed. \nO'SHEA Finishing each other's sentences now? \nLISA What? \nO'SHEA Nothing. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       53. \nPADDY They're hatching. \nThe trio turn to notice Paddy has joined them looking down at the smooshed Grabber. O'Shea considers Paddy. \nO'SHEA It took three of us to get that thing off me. \nPADDY I woulda helped but I've a bad back, gives me shocking pain, you know yourself. \nO'SHEA How are you still alive? \nPADDY Diet and exercise. \nO'SHEA No, when that thing attacked you. You should be laid out in a box right now, but you're not. What makes you so special? \nPADDY I was always lucky. \nO'Shea disregards him and takes a swig of his flask as Lisa considers the bloody sick. Queasy. \nSMITH Mustn't have liked your blood much. \nLISA What have you been eating? \nO'Shea stills, hearing that question. \nO'SHEA (TO PADDY) You were drunk! \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY \nStorm clouds gather over the idyllic drinking hole as gales jeer and waves pile on the pub's neighbouring harbour. \nINT. DR GLEESON'S SURGERY - DAY \nDr Gleeson peers at the Grabber's severed head in a beaker, gawping away like a fish head. He squirms. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       54. \nDR GLEESON Grabbers? \nSMITH No, it's a cryptozoological amphibious sanguivore. \nLISA (to Dr Gleeson) Not a tiger. \nDr Gleeson removes his glasses to stare at O'Shea. \nDR GLEESON Where are you getting all these heads? \nO'SHEA Come on. \nShe leaves, grinning. \nBRIAN Great. It's her birthday next week now she thinks this is something for her. \nDR GLEESON She's in for a shock. \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY \nO'Shea, Lisa, Smith, Brian and Dr Gleeson huddle. \nO'SHEA Listen, the only people that know about this are us and it's gotta stay that way or we'll have a panic on our hands. \nThe group confer, sharing glances. \nLISA How drunk are we talking here? \nSMITH Paddy levels of drunkenness. \nThey laugh loudly. \nDR GLEESON You're gone off your game, boy. \nLISA No offence but I don't think my body can handle Paddy levels. \nPADDY It takes years of practice. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011      58. \nBRIAN If those things do come for us, we'd be lambs to the slaughter if bombed out of our brains. \nLISA And with everyone hammered there's no one in a fit state to call the shots. The non-alcoholic shots. \nDR GLEESON Yeah but single someone out and they'll be sought as the only meat on the menu. \nLISA But what's to keep us safe from ourselves, forget what's outside, we could fall over and break our necks trying to conga. Statistics prove put a large number of people in a confined space, ply them with booze and -- \nPADDY -- you've got a hooley. \nLISA That's not what it said. \nO'SHEA This will work. And I'll keep order. I won't be drinking. \nLisa almost steps back to take a closer look of him. \nLISA You?   We'll both do it. \nSMITH That would put you both at risk.    I suggest it's just O'Shea. \nO'SHEA Thanks. (TO LISA) Only one of us need risk it and I know these people and this island better than you. It should be me. \nSMITH I agree. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         59. \nLisa ushers O'Shea aside (leaving the others talking amongst themselves). \nLISA I see what you're doing here but have you forgotten you're a dependent alcoholic organising a piss up in a brewery! I'll do it. It'll be easier. \nO'SHEA Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink. I know that. So do you.     I can do this. \nPADDY It's gonna rain any minute. \nLisa looks at him, holding his stare.   O'Shea doesn't flinch. FINALLY -- \nLISA OK. But just so you know, I don't drink. I've never even been drunk. I don't know if I can. \nO'SHEA Of course you can. And you'll be the best drunken Guard this country's ever seen. You'll probably get promoted. \nLISA Ah stop. \nO'Shea smiles encouragingly. He takes out his flask and hands it to her. Suddenly he seems taller. \nSMITH Right, if we're doing this we'll need a blood test from a healthy subject. Lisa, you're the fittest person here. \nLISA (BLUSHES) You charmer. It's true, though. \nO'SHEA Brian, I want a table of everything Paddy had last night. \nBRIAN What night was last night? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           60. \nPADDY Saturday night. \nLISA Oh you gotta be joking me! \nPADDY Oh it was a big one. \nBRIAN Comin' right up. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY - LATER \nThe table has six empties on it. Lisa sees double that though as she grips her seat for balance. \nThe patrol jeep parks at the chapel. \nEXT. CHAPEL - DAY \nBrian, O'Shea and Lisa make their way towards the chapel doors. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nINT. CHAPEL - DAY \nFR POTTS, an incredulous elder statesman, finishes mass.    His eclectic congregation of forty or so ISLANDERS bless themselves -- FISHERMEN, HOUSEWIVES, OAPs, Una, etc. \nFR POTTS Mass has ended, go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen. \nO'Shea, Brian and Lisa enter the back of the chapel. \nO'SHEA Is this everyone? \nBRIAN It's Fr Potts last mass, so everyone that didn't leave yesterday for the thing in Dungary. \nO'Shea and Lisa walk up the aisle towards Fr Potts as people rise to leave, some chatting to each other as they go. \nO'SHEA Father, do you mind if I say a few words? \nFR POTTS Go mad. \nO'Shea takes to the pulpit. \nO'SHEA Can I have your attention please? \nThe congregation looks up, considering O'Shea.   MAMIE, a grey haired granny, tuts to her neighbour. \nMAMIE Oh here we go. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       64. \nO'SHEA Folks, just a quick announcement, at Maher's Tavern tonight we're having a bit of a shindig and you're all coming to join us for what will be a great night's craic! \nA wall of silence. \nUNA You're throwing a party? \nO'SHEA Yeah. \nUNA Why? \nO'SHEA Who needs a reason to have a laugh? \nLisa gestures to O'Shea, still drunk but she'll field this one. \nLISA It's a welcome party for me. \nLisa seems very proud of herself for coming up with that. \nUNA A welcome party? But you're leaving in a fortnight. \nLISA So it's a goodbye party.    Whatever. \nUNA You only just got here. \nLISA (TO O'SHEA) What's her problem? \nO'SHEA What we mean to say is -- \nA FISHERMAN rises to leave. \nLISA -- Hey bucko! Where are you going? This party's for your benefit. And all of you are gonna be there too. It's the law! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       65. \nLISA (CONT'D) And I swear to God I'll arrest any one of you who isn't. Chalk it down! \nLisa glares at the congregation. \nFISHERMAN Are you coddin' us, love? \nLISA What's your name? \nHe wilts. \nO'SHEA What Garda Nolan means is we'd love your company. There's no point going home to a cold, empty house in weather like tonight when we'll be right across the street from here and we'll have music and craic and company -- and a FREE BAR! \nBRIAN What?! \nHILDA, a stout woman, grabs her coat. \nHILDA Sold! \nO'SHEA That's the spirit! So c'mon, it's a party and the drinks are on us! \nShe staggers off. \nINT. PUB KITCHEN - NIGHT \nSmith sips his vodka coke, watching the back door and standing by with the walkie talkie. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \nPaddy sips his pint by the front door while Una dances with Hilda, Mamie and others. \nINT./EXT. PATROL JEEP - NIGHT \nO'Shea and Lisa sit on stakeout outside the pub, rain pelting against the windscreen. \nLISA I dunno, you know? \nShe doubles up, laughing.     O'Shea fights off a smile. \nLISA C'mere. Listen. Listen. At the end of the day, you know? I dunno. I'm so into you right now. Joke. (MUFFLED) Kinda. \nShe watches his reaction and stifles a burp. \nO'SHEA How much have you had? \nLISA Not enough to fancy you. \nO'SHEA Then keep drinking. \nO'Shea puts the breathalyser in her mouth. \nO'SHEA Blow. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       69. \nLISA That's it, is it? You think I think I fancy you. That's the sitchuashun we got, huh? \nO'SHEA (OFF BREATHALYSER) No more for you. \nLISA Well I do. So whatcha wanna do 'bout it? Arrest me? \nShe smiles coyly.   Or tries to. \nO'SHEA You know as flattering as it is to hear a beautiful drunk slurring her feelings for me, now's not the time. \nLisa scoffs, then something (slightly) sobers her. \nLISA Why do you drink so much, Ciar\u00e1n? \nO'SHEA For the craic. \nLISA Yeah right, and I work everyday 'cause I'm driven. \nLisa hears herself aloud.    The admission sinks her. \nLISA Always chasing them goals, you know? Always chasing. Always running. \nO'Shea considers her, recognising her vulnerability. \nO'SHEA You're too hard on yourself. \nLisa wells up, the drink making her emotional. \nLISA I feel like I've known you for years. I don't know why. \nO'SHEA Maybe because I put years onto people. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        70. \nLISA ... Yeah.    That's true. \nThey gaze at each other until O'Shea looks away first.   Lisa hiccups. As ladylike as possible. \nLISA I'm sorry about your wife, O'Shea. I really am. \nO'SHEA My what? \nLISA Una told me, how she died.    I'm so sorry. \nO'SHEA Una said what?   Of all the stories. Una is the biggest gossip going. You shouldn't listen to her. No one died. We just ... we didn't work out. \nLISA Oh.    Ah shite, I'm sorry. \nO'SHEA You're grand. \nLISA ... Did you split because ... because of your alcoholickissness? \nO'SHEA I didn't drink back then. No, she met someone else. It happens. \nO'Shea hides it well but this hurts.    Lisa notices. \nLISA Feck her, O'Shea. If you want I'll find her and do her in for you? \nDr Gleeson sneaks out, spots the Patrol Jeep and ducks into the alcove -- out of sight. \nHe leans against the wall, peeing. Rain runs down the corrugated roof. Relief. For now. He zips up, turns and sees ... JUMPERS. Dozens of them. Dr Gleeson chills. \nLimbless bouncing piranhas. They move clumsily, regularly toppling over as they hop, leap and jump. They're not very intelligent or agile but they're inquisitive. And starving. \nFor a moment there's a curious stand-off, and then a Jumper hops closer startling Dr Gleeson. \nDR GLEESON Whoa, feck off! \nDr Gleeson kicks it like a football and it launches through the air, SQUEALING. With beaks gaping, spiked tongues curling, the rest of the Jumpers move in on him. \nINT./EXT. PATROL JEEP - NIGHT \nO'Shea tosses a peanut into the air to catch in his open mouth but he misses as he stares, slackjawed at -- \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \n-- Dr Gleeson staggering blindly in the rain, a Jumper clamped onto his head, swallowing him down to his nose. \nDR GLEESON Christ Almighty, me head! \nO'Shea bounds from the jeep, hurley in hand.   Lisa flanks him, staggering with a golf club. \nO'SHEA Jim, don't move! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           74. \nDr Gleeson stumbles forward as Jumpers maul him and others circle like fat toddlers around an ice-cream truck. He falls to his knees before O'Shea and Lisa. \nDR GLEESON Get it off! Get it off! \nLisa stamps the group as if scaring off a load of stray cats. \nLISA Git!   G'wan! Shag off! \nThe Jumpers keep their distance as O'Shea drags the Jumper off Dr Gleeson's head, like tugging on a wedged welly. He pulls it off and the Jumpers disperse into the shadows. \nO'SHEA You OK, Jim? \nDr Gleeson catches his breath, gasping, his hair stood up on his head like a gelled explosion. \nDR GLEESON I had to piss. \nSuddenly the silhouette of a tree behind Dr Gleeson comes alive. They're not branches, they're tentacles. Flashes of lightning reflect off its slick, oily skin as -- \nA TORNADO OF BLACK FEELERS SLITHER FORWARD.    25 foot of ugly. \nOff Lisa and O'Shea's horrified faces, Dr Gleeson turns to meet Medusa on a bad hair day. \nThe Grabber seizes him, lifts him high and dangles him over its jaws like plucked grapes. Then drops him before he can scream. Devoured like a banana in a blender. \nDr Gleeson's dead. Or at least incredibly injured. The Grabber spits a pip: Dr Gleeson's head. It lands at Lisa's feet. No, he's definitely dead. \nLISA Fuck that. \nLisa bounds for the jeep.     The Grabber ROARS!   Spittle flying out of its gaping maw. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \n\"The Irish Rover\" bellows on the JUKEBOX. People clap and jig. Una swings Fr Potts, linked onto him, until he flies loose of her and staggers into Paddy's table. Wahey! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         75. \nFR POTTS Jesus Christ, Una. \nEveryone's having a ball.

Driving drunk. \nO'SHEA WAIT!    Oh Jesus Mary Mother of God. \nShe slams on the brakes.      Skids. \nLISA Shite.    Get in. \nO'Shea catches up and dives in the backseat. \nO'SHEA Drive!    Drive! \nLisa does, but reversing towards the Grabber. \nO'SHEA AHH, THE OTHER WAY!      THE OTHER WAY! \nThey ram into the Grabber, the car jolting violently. \nO'Shea and Lisa drag the heavy table into position. \nOMITTED \nINT. PUB KITCHEN - NIGHT \nFinally Brian sets the wick in the nozzle of the super-soaker alight, pumps furiously and aims it out the door. \nBRIAN All right you ugly bollocks, have some of this shit! \nHe takes squirts and ... nothing happens.   Except the gun tip melts and lights ablaze. \nBRIAN Ahh, Christ! \nThe Grabber ROARS getting closer. \nO'SHEA That's gonna blow!   Get rid of it! \nBrian tosses the super-soaker outside and slams the door, double-bolting it, just in time as Una sways in, drink in hand, to find O'Shea, Lisa, Smith and Brian in a right state. \nUNA (SLURRED) What's goin' on? \nO'SHEA Nothing! \nBOOM! A bright flash of fire blossoms outside.   O'Shea barricades the door with furniture. \nUNA What was that? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011      79. \nBRIAN What was what? \nBrian grabs a glass of wine. \nBRIAN Here, honey, have a drink. \nUNA I have a drink. \nBRIAN Have two. \nUNA I've drunk enough. \nO'SHEA Move back. \nTHUD!    The door rattles. \nUNA (CALLS OUT) Who is it? \nBRIAN It's nobody, honey. \nLISA Who wants toast? \nSMITH I do. \nO'SHEA Is every one all right? \nLISA Grand. \nBLEURGH!    Smith vomits against the wall. \nUNA Mother of Jesus! \nPOP!    Lisa's toast arrives.      She butters it. \nO'SHEA Is this what I'm like when I'm drunk? \nLisa stares at him, chewing toast.       Eyes swimming. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       80. \nLISA You're worse. \nO'Shea hustles every one out of the kitchen. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nO'Shea pushes through the oblivious patrons towards the bar. Brian flicks the taps. They hiss and sputter. \nBRIAN (TO O'SHEA) We're dry. \nPADDY We're what?! \nBRIAN Unless someone goes outside to change the kegs, we're done drinking for the night. \nPaddy's devastated. \nPADDY No!    NO! \nHe thumps the counter. \nPADDY I was just gettin' a taste for it. \nO'SHEA I know. \nLISA What are we gonna do now? \nO'SHEA Fuck knows. \nO'Shea takes out and checks the flare gun. Two cartridges. He looks around him, looking for ideas. He sees something -- GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          99. \nO'SHEA I've got an idea. \nLisa clocks something, too.   On the other side of them. \nLISA I've got an idea too. \nO'SHEA What's your idea? \nLISA Why, what are you thinking? \nO'SHEA I'M THINKING-- \nThe Grabber lurches forward sounding the starter pistol and storms towards them. \nLISA (at the Grabber) Wait! We're not ready! \nO'SHEA Run! \nLISA Give me the keys! \nO'Shea tosses Cooney's leprechaun key-chain at Lisa. She reaches to catch it but it sails past her drunken hands. \nLISA Got 'em.   Shit! \nLisa staggers after the keys and snatches them off the footprints she left in the cement, now dry and rock hard. \nLISA Got 'em! \nO'Shea runs the incline of the ramp, gunning for the pit. \nINT./EXT.

DERELICT SITE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nO'Shea finds the pit as the Grabber follows him, ROARING. He darts across the metal ladder laid over the pit like a rickety bridge. The concrete hole waiting to swallow him up. \nThe Grabber edges towards the pit, snarling.     It reaches the edge and stalls, feeling its surroundings. \nO'Shea is almost at the other side of the ladder when the Grabber snatches hold of it and yanks it away from under him. \nO'Shea just makes the safety of the rim giving him a foothold with a twenty foot drop onto shards of broken barrels and iron girders beyond that. If he slips he's dead. \nThe Grabber considers him, edging no further. O'Shea sees the oil tanks, he aims the flare gun at the drums. Finger on the trigger, ready and waiting. \nO'SHEA Come on, you langer. Just a little closer. Move. Hey, you want me, you're going have to come across and get -- \n-- WHIPAH! The Grabber's barbed tongue shoots across the pit and lances the air around him. O'Shea's well within reach. \nO'SHEA Awwwwww bollocks. \nWHIPAH! O'Shea jumps left. WHIPAH! He jumps right. Inches to spare each time as O'Shea tries to take aim while ducking. \nHe fires and the flare misses the oil drum. It strikes an exposed girder and lands in the pit, glowing and smouldering. \nHe ducks the tongue and reloads, balanced precariously. \nINT./EXT. BULLDOZER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nLisa jacks the screwdriver into the ignition and turns. The ENGINE rumbles to life along with the radio. She moves to put on her seat-belt but stops herself. Feck it. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            101. \nShe flips the lights on, full beam. Releases the hand-brake. Steels herself and slams the foot down, switching gears.

He looks up to Una, Brian, Lisa and Paddy watching him. He forces the best smile he can muster. \nO'SHEA We'll be fine! \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \nThe Grabber retreats into the darkness. \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT - LATER \nBrian opens the door to a supply closet. O'Shea and Lisa flank him. The closet's full of innocuous cleaning products, blankets, etc. \nBRIAN It's just linen and cleaning stuff. Nothing we can really use. \nFISHERMAN Why can't ya just shoot it?     Ye guys must have some guns. \nBrian closes the closet. \nO'SHEA We're the Gardai. Not the LAPD. (off their faces) An Garda Siochana will succeed not by force of arms or numbers, but on their moral authority as servants of the people. \nLisa gasps. She grins at him with drunken pride.    O'Shea almost blushes. \nFISHERMAN We're bolloxed. \nBRIAN Yep. \nBrian shuts the door. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       87. \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT \nO'Shea watches the windows. \nO'SHEA Something's not right.   It can't be that hungry. \nEavesdropping, Paddy chimes in. \nPADDY It's the female. It's following her scent. Sure didn't she slime you in the lab? Like with me bathroom and Tadhg Murphy. \nO'SHEA Tadhg Murphy's dead! \nSome hallway people whimper, overhearing O'Shea. \nO'SHEA No, no, Tadhg Murphy's fine. He's at the festival on the mainland. \nLISA And so's his wife. \nThe Islanders gasp.    Irene's dead too?!     Ah fuck. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \nTHUD!    A dead sheep slams the door (as Cooney did). \nINT. LISA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrian peeks out the bedroom window.     Brian rounds the corner, back towards O'Shea et al ... \nBRIAN It's swinging one of Tommy Riordan's sheep at the door. \nPaddy, Lisa, Una and O'Shea look.     THUD!   THUD! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011      88. \nLISA My cat does that, then leaves it on the doorstep as a present. \nPADDY A mating ritual. \nTHUD!    CRASH!   BANG! \nO'SHEA What the hell does that mean? \nPADDY It'll try to mount you, somehow. Failing that it'll most likely rip you limb from limb in frustration. \nO'SHEA Grand.   Ah sure what can ya do. \nLISA Play hard to get. \n", "test2_input": "THUD!    The Grabber ROARS and slithers off into the shadows. \nHILDA Oh, God.     What does it want? \nO'Shea looks at the scared Islanders. He's what it wants. The sound of WINDOWS SHATTERING. Islander's whimper. \nUNA It's not gonna stop, is it? We won't survive the night. We're on a sinking ship. \nBrian breathalyses himself sorrowfully. \nO'SHEA What's your reading? \nBRIAN Too drunk to drive a car but not drunk enough. We're sobering up. All of us. \nO'Shea nods tensely. \nBrian consoles Una as another loud THUD shakes the floor and the ceiling light shade above them. \nUNA We can't just sit here. It'll bring the walls down around us. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011   89. \nPADDY What if we threw a bomb at it? \nBRIAN Have you got semtex on you? \nPADDY Not on me, no. \nBRIAN How about we like push it off a cliff or something. \nUNA Or electrocute it?   I don't know. \nPADDY I vote we feed it Father Potts. Unless it eats shit it'll choke to death. \nFR POTTS I beg your pardon. \nFr Potts perks up from the darker corner. \nPADDY Feck, is he in here? I was joking, Father. I apologise. \nFr Potts disregards him. \nUNA If we can't destroy it, what can we do? \nO'SHEA (to Fr Potts) What about the phones? \nFr Potts shakes his head.   Nothing. \nO'SHEA OK, we know it does two things: it drinks blood and it breathes water. We took away one, we could take away the other. \nUNA What do you mean? \nO'SHEA We need to keep it away from water. Dry it out somehow. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         90. \nPADDY (re. the rain) Look outside. \nO'SHEA There's got to be some way we can stop it, fight fire with fire. \nLisa notices her police boots from the day before, seeing the chalky stains all along them. An idea! \nLISA The Grabber! Not the Grabber- Grabber, the mechanical one! (off their confusion) The big yoke, with the arm and the thing and you know? That big aul whatchamacallit you crush things with. The feckin' thing at Cooney's site! What's it called? \nPADDY A Grabber? \nLISA Exactly! With that thing you could grab it, hoist it up and trap it. It's raining now but it has to stop some time right? And when it does it'd be stuck. Once the sun comes up it'd cook. That'd dry it out. \nO'Shea's eyes brighten, he smiles at Lisa.    She smiles back, properly proud of herself. \nPADDY You think you can catch that thing? \nUNA Sure 'tis lepping about all over the shop. \nBRIAN You'd need some sort of...? \nO'Shea clenches the leprechaun key-ring in his fist. \nO'SHEA -- A death trap. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        91. \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nO'Shea moves to a window to clock a white PICKUP TRUCK parked outside in the rain. His purposeful stride instilling confidence in the others. O'Shea's back in charge. \nO'SHEA (TO BRIAN) Have you got the keys to your truck? \nBrian checks his pockets. \nBRIAN They'd be in the kitchen.     On the table, I think. \nO'SHEA I need them. \n", "test2_true": "BRIAN She's right. \nPADDY You might not get past them, but someone else could. \nFR POTTS You'd be talking about the drunkest person we got. \nAll eyes fall on Lisa as she licks her dry mouth.   Off their LOOKS -- \nO'SHEA Absolutely not, it's too risky. Paddy you go. \nPADDY What?   Feck off!   Brian should go. \nBrian considers it.   Una's having none of it. \nBRIAN I could try... \nUNA Not a hope. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            92. \nLISA (rises, swaying) Slow down there. I'll do it. \nO'SHEA No.   It's too dangerous. \nLISA Which is exactly why you'll want the best drunken guard this country's ever seen. Right? \nLisa looks at him, holding his stare.     O'Shea smiles. \nINT. TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT - LATER \nThe gang rally around Lisa at the stairway blockade.       O'Shea hands her the nail-gun. \nO'SHEA If you get in trouble.      Pull the trigger. \nShe takes it in her hands, drunkenly marveling. \nLISA Oooh, savage. \nShe pulls the trigger and a nail stabs the wall inches from Paddy's head. \nO'SHEA Careful. \nBRIAN You missed. \nPaddy throws Brian a withering look. \nO'SHEA Just get the keys and come right back. I'll do the rest. \nFr Potts blesses her. \nLISA Got it.    Just the keys. \nThey pull away debris, allowing a gap. Lisa and O'Shea's gaze holds a second longer than necessary. Lisa smiles. \nLISA I'll be all right. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         93. \nINT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT - INTERCUT \nLisa scrambles through.    Una steals a glimpse downstairs. \nUNA Look what they've done to the carpets! \nBrian consoles Una as O'Shea and Paddy seal the gap. \nSuddenly Lisa TRIPS and slips down some stairs. Waking the dead. O'Shea, Brian, Una and Paddy gasp, listening. \nLisa picks herself up. \nLISA IT'S OK!   I'M ALL RIGHT! \nO'SHEA Shush!!    Keep your voice down! \nPADDY She's a goner. \nO'Shea looks at Paddy, then at Brian. \nBRIAN How are you gonna get to the truck? \nO'SHEA Run very fast. \nUNA Love, you're not that fast. \nFR POTTS You'll need a decoy. \nPADDY I got it. If its you it wants, then we give it what it wants. We fashion a dummy, dress it up like bait and confuse the shite out of it. It won't know where to look when there's two of you. \nFR POTTS And how the hell do we make a dummy? \nO'Shea looks at Paddy, he likes that idea. \n", "test3_input": "O'SHEA Improvise. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          94. \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \nJumpers mill about, tearing the place asunder. One studies itself in a mirror, until it can't stand itself any more. It attacks the mirror and knocks itself out. \nAnother chokes while trying to eat a pool ball.   Lisa rounds a corner, slumping lazily against the wall. \nLISA Focus. \nShe takes a deep breath and moves in amongst them. She sidesteps over one and dips her hand into a peanut bowl. She palms them into her mouth, chews and scans the room. \nA Jumper leaps onto the counter beside her. POP! It collapses back. Another Jumper climbs onto her foot. \nLISA Get off. \nShe kicks her leg and the Jumper flies off and smacks into the JUKEBOX, turning it on. Mundy's \"Galway Girl\" blasts. \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT \nBrian, Una, Fr Potts, O'Shea and Paddy grab supplies. A mop, a broom, a coat rack, marigold gloves, twine. The MUSIC BLEEDS UPSTAIRS: \nUNA I love that song. \nPADDY What is she doing at all? \nThey begin assembling something as O'Shea masks his concern: \nO'SHEA Hurry. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nINT. PUB KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLisa searches for the keys. She scans the floor, finding the full bottle of potcheen Smith drank. \nShe tucks it in her jacket pocket and continues searching as behind her the back door slowly opens; its lock broken. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         95. \nTentacles reach inside, snaking silently towards her as she finds Smith's Zippo lighter and holds onto it. \nShe spots the keys under a stove and reaches, straining. Her face flush with the floor as the tentacles close in. Suddenly a stray tentacle knocks a dangling skillet -- \n-- CLANG! Lisa spins and fires the nail gun as tentacles rush towards her. \nA hail of nails stab the wall and BLOW OUT the wall mounted fuse box -- BANG! \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT \nSudden DARKNESS is met with SCREAMS! \nMAHER'S PUB \nLisa dives into the main bar and flips the Zippo lighter as the Grabber seizes her leg. \nThe lighter falls beyond reach and takes fuel off the coat rack. Flames crawl high upon the jackets and coats. \nLISA UH FIRE!   FIRE! \nThe Grabber drags Lisa across the pub floor. \nINT./EXT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nPaddy, Brian and O'Shea slot the mop into the coat rack and slide a broom through the horizontal gap, its clear now they're building a scarecrow. O'Shea puts his jacket over it, dressing it. Una sniffs the air in the hall. \nUNA Do you smell smoke? \nINT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nLisa grabs hold of the bar counter foot rail, but she's quickly pulled from it and slides into the \nPUB KITCHEN \ntowards the gaping jaws that fill the backyard door frame. She grabs broken bottles off the floor and stabs at the tentacle, glassing them. She grabs Dr Gleeson's board with a nail in it and slams it home. It uncoils around her feet. \nFree, she runs for the pub front door. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           96. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY WINDOW - NIGHT \nO'Shea frantically pulls apart the blockade as smoke funnels up towards them. People panic. \nFR POTTS We're going up in flames! \nO'SHEA Where is she? \nBRIAN You gotta go now. \n", "test3_true": "BRIAN We can't wait, son. \nO'Shea opens the hallway window and climbs out.   He nods towards Brian awaiting his cue: do it. \nINT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT \nBrian flings the window open towards the rain. \nPADDY Yoohoo! Come and get me, you rotten bastard! \nPaddy, Fr Potts, Brian and Una pick up O'Shea's scarecrow decoy and chuck it out the window into the back yard. Brian shuts the window and SPLAT-BANG! \nEveryone jumps back!   Startled as -- \n-- the Grabbers's mouth fills the window, kissing glass. It crawls upwards, smudging the window. Folks stare, horrified. \nBrian looks back at O'Shea's open window.   He runs to it. \nEXT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT \nO'Shea drops onto the back wall and shimmies along it. \nBRIAN Run, O'Shea, run! \nO'Shea looks back at Brian and sees pitching itself over the roof of the pub -- the GRABBER. It cascades towards him like a sticky spaghetti slinky, tentacles tumbling. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         97. \nSuddenly skidding around the corner, spewing up mud, comes Lisa in Brian's old pickup. She parks right below O'Shea. \nO'SHEA Lisa? \nLISA Would ya come on for fuck sake! \nO'Shea's never been so pleased to see her behind the wheel. \nINT./EXT. PICKUP - NIGHT \nTHUMP!   O'Shea jumps in the pickup. \nO'SHEA GO! \nLISA I'm breaking so many laws. Drinking on duty. Driving under the influence. Speeding. Driving without lights on. \nO'SHEA PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON! \nLISA (SHE DOES) Ah that's better. \nThey tear off, leaving the Grabber behind.     ROARING! \nINT. UPSTAIRS WINDOW - NIGHT \nBrian, Paddy and Una watch from the window. \nPADDY Good luck, boy. \nBrian hands Paddy an axe.      (Burying the hatchet.) \nBRIAN Let's bury the hatchet, Paddy... into the heads of those feckin' things! \nPADDY Jumpers. \nUNA Come on! \nPaddy takes the axe and the trio turn to go to work. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       98. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nBrian's pickup races along, splashing through a puddle and leaving an empty road in its wake, that is until the Grabber appears over the hill, ripping along and gaining on them. \nEXT. DERELICT SITE - NIGHT \nRain dribbles down the \"KEEP OUT\" sign as the pickup smacks into it, knocking it down. Lisa and O'Shea bail out and regard the empty site. Lisa runs towards the trucks as -- \n-- O'Shea makes a beeline for the site's gennie. He starts it up and light fills the site from big work lamps dotted about. \nO'SHEA It's following me, so you get the crusher and I'll lure it into position. \nLisa backs into O'Shea, dread painted on her face. \nLISA It's gone. \nO'SHEA What is? \nLISA The crusher, the JCB. It's gone. It's not here anymore. \nOn that -- A ROAR! They turn and see the Grabber staring at them from across camp. It stalks forward like a cat approaching its prey. O'Shea and Lisa back up, keeping their distance. No sudden movements. \nLISA Ciar\u00e1n. \n"}

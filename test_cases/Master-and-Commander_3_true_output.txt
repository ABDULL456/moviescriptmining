The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back at them. 
JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine, TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot. 
LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the hip. 
JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling, swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other with barely room to fall. 
The Acherons are gradually forced back across their quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship. 
285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON 
JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK and killing the pikeman. 
To either side, privateers are trying to reach them, shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish. 
Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and foe alike. 
KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream. 
AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat- cleaver right and left. 
286.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON 
A commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended Surprise, and leads a counter-attack over onto her quarterdeck. 
CALAMY Look to our quarter-deck! 
287. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE 
BLAKENEY, dirk in hand, turns to face them, as does HOWARD and his men, but they are gravely outnumbered. 
288.   FORECASTLE, ACHERON 
CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the Surprise, calling for others to follow. 
Calamy This way! Follow me! 
289. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE 
STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's surprising skill. 
CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees stabbing at the legs of the attackers. 
290.   WAIST, ACHERON 
JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern, the defenders falling back in disarray. 
291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON 
PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side. 
A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them. 
The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN. 
292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON 
CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a team as they move toward the stern. 
292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON 
Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack. Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall. 
293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON 
JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale. 
294.   IN THE WATER 
Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat, clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull. 
295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP 
Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on. 
296.   BELOW DECKS 
JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners. 
Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers. 
He makes his way through to the Great Cabin. 
297.   GREAT CABIN, ACHERON 
Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

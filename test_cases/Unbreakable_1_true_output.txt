FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street. 
THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE. 
A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not bleeding. 
HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES. 
About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole. It's front is on fire. 
Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND. 
Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced surface of the road. 
He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame. 
THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious. 
DAVID Megan... 
She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel. 
David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move. 
The heat from the fire is tremendous. 
David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength. 
WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY RIPS OPEN. 
David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding. 
David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her down gently. 
DAVID Megan? 
He just stares at her. She doesn't respond. 
A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road. David waves frantically. The truck slows. 
David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open. 
Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at David. 
MEGAN(soft) I thought I was dead. 
Beat. 
DAVID Me too. 
The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David. 
DRIVER Is she all right? 
DAVID I think her leg is fractured. 
DRIVER Are you injured? 
Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the driver. 
DAVID(soft) My shoulder's hurt. 
The driver nods. 
DRIVER Hold on. I got a C.B. in the truck. 
The driver moves back to his truck. 
David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car on fire. 
CUT TO: 
PRESENT: EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT 
David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF THE PHONE RINGING. 
He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat piles.

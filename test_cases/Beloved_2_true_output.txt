PAUL We was just starting to feel a little like a family ourselves. 
SETHE Is that what's got your teeth on edge? 
PAUL I can't place it. It's a feeling in me. 
SETHE You wanna feel somethin!? ... Feel how it is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody there not worrying you to death about what you got to do each day to deserve it. And if that don't get it, feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything God made liable to jump on you. Feel that! 
PAUL I know every bit of that, Sethe. I wasn't born yesterday and I never mistreated a woman in my life! 
SETHE Well, that makes one of you in this world. 
PAUL (surprised) One? Not two. 
SETHE No. Not two! 
PAUL What Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by you. He never left you. 
SETHE Ha, what'd he leave then if not me, huh? 
PAUL I don't know but it wasn't you. That's a fact. 
SETHE Then he did worse - he left his children. 
PAUL You don't know that. 
SETHE HE WASN'T THERE! He wasn't where he said he would be! I had to pack my babies off ahead of me, on their own, so I could stay behind to look for him...Underground agent said by Sunday we had to leave.. Sunday came and he wasn't there. 
PAUL He couldn't get out of the loft, I expect. 
Forgetting himself, Paul let that slip out. 
SETHE Loft? What loft? 
PAUL (hesitates) The one over your head... The one in the barn. 
Sethe stops dead cold. It's no use... 
The MEMORY TAKES OVER: 
INT. BARN - THE PAST. 
Violent, rapid images of Sethe being raped and beaten held down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S BOYS. Sethe, pinned down, stares up at the loft...Camera rises up... 
There, in the loft, hides HALLE...The expression on his face is that of a man broken in two... 
END of MEMORY. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. 
Sethe wraps her arms tightly around herself and asks; 
SETHE He saw? He told you he saw? 
PAUL You told me. The day I came here. You said they stole your milk. I never knew what messed Halle up. That was it, I guess. I seen him the day after you left. Says where you been Halle? All he says to me was "the loft". I asked him what he meant not going with you but he never answers me. But I knew was something broke him. Not one of them years of Saturdays, Sundays and nighttime extra never touched him. But whatever he saw go on in the barn that day broke him like a twig. 
SETHE He saw them boys do that to me and let them keep on breathing? 
PAUL A man ain't a Goddamn ax, Sethe. Chopping, hacking, busting every Goddamn minute of the day. Things get to him. Things he can't chop down cause they inside him. The last time I saw him, I knew he was broken for good... 
SETHE What did he say? 
PAUL Nothing. 
SETHE What did you say? Didn't you say anything to him? 
PAUL I couldn't. 
SETHE Couldn't?! Why the hell not?! 
C.U. on PAUL who doesn't want to explain - or even remember - as we cut to: 
MEMORY: 
EXT. SWEET HOME - DAY. 
PAUL HAS A BIT IN HIS MOUTH CHAINED TO A WAGON. 
He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men, by Three white Men. The bit jerks his head back, saliva spills uncontrollably out of his mouth. His hands are chained behind him. His feet chained together at the ankles....Another chain is connected to an iron belt and stretches to a wagon. He is being lead away with forty five other prisoners... 
PAUL (VO) I tried to kill Brandywine - man Schoolteacher sold me to. Don't know what possessed me...Me and about 45 other prisoners were being walked from Kentucky to Virginia...then on to Georgia. Two places I don't ever want to see again. 
He is lead past the milk shed, when he sees: 
HALLE, alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting by the butter churn. HALLE'S FACE IS COVERED WITH BUTTER AND CLABBER. He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands. 
The White Men laugh. Paul is aching to scream out to him but the iron bit holds down his tongue. 
As Paul is lead past Halle, A ROOSTER named MISTER is SITTING ON A TUB in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee. 
WHITE MAN Look at Mister there... (referring to the rooster) You go tell these niggers where to go there Mister! Crow'em right outta here! 
Mister crows and the white men laugh. 
Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Paul's face. He struggles to keep a view of Halle, until he is out of sight. 
END OF MEMORY. 
EXT. PORCH. - EARLY EVENING. 
Paul approaches Sethe, touching her gently. 
PAUL I didn't mean to tell you that. 
SETHE I didn't plan on hearing it. 
PAUL I can't take it back but I can leave it alone. 
Sethe, instead of collapsing from the information, she seems hardened. 
PAUL Let's do that..let's leave it alone now. 
SETHE (more to herself) Let it alone. Just sit down and leave it be! Yeah that would be nice. Would be even nicer to lose it altogether - if I had my choice. Halle did. Other people's brains stopped, went crazy. How sweet that would have been. Me and Halle squatting by that churn, smashing cold lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in the world..

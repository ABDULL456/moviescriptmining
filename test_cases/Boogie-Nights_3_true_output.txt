So remember that I'm your friend and 
listen to what I tell you now: Give in, Jack. 
You've gotta give. For you, for your business 
and your livelihood -- accept the future. 
Don't fight it, because you can't win. 
Look for the new blood, go to Floyd Gondolli, 
go to video, give up your battle -- the 
filmmaking is over, Jack. 
The Officers take him away. Jack watches him leave. DOLLY IN CLOSE ON JACK.

CAMERA HOLDS A LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP AT JACK, KURT and ROCKY. They look into CAMERA. HOLD. 
JACK 
Well there we go. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
Yeah. 
ROCKY 
Lot of stuff on there to learn. 
JACK 
That's it. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
No turning back now. 
JACK 
The future. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
That's right. 
ROCKY 
The quality is, uh -- 
JACK 
It's not what we're used to. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
We can make it work, I think. 
ROCKY 
It's . . . potential . . . 
KURT LONGJOHN 
Yes. 
JACK 
You can't beat the price. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
No you can't. 
JACK 
This is the future and we can't deny 
it anymore because the past is too expensive. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
I'm scared. 
ROCKY 
Me too. 
JACK 
It's gonna make us rich. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
Yep. 
ROCKY 
It's a rather pretty thing, isn't it? 
REVERSE ANGLE: A new VIDEO CAMERA is sitting on the table in front of them. This is the thing they've been discussing. 
KURT LONGJOHN 
We can still tell good stories, Jack. 
JACK 
No. It's about jacking off now, Kurt. 
No more stories . . . that's over.

That's great, guys. That's so great. 
JEROME 
It's gonna be a great opportunity to run 
the store my way. Y'know. Get those guys 
off my back and run the store my way. 
CAMERA picks up and follows Dirk who walks over to Jack's table -- 
ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE 
Jack is sitting with a handsome young kid, JOHNNY DOE (aged 18.) Dirk arrives; 
JACK 
. . . and it's tough is what I'm saying. 
JOHNNY DOE 
Right. 
JACK 
Hey, Dirk -- here you are. You havin' 
a good time? 
DIRK 
Uh-huh. 
(re: Johnny Doe) 
Who's this? 
JOHNNY DOE 
Hi . . . I'm Johnny Doe. You're Dirk 
Diggler -- it's great to meet you. 
JACK 
Dirk, meet Johnny Doe . . . New Kid On The 
Block. He's interested in the business. 
Dirk nods his head, picks up his sunglasses from the table and walks off across the dance floor. Jack turns back to Johnny Doe; 
JACK 
He's pretty tired, Johnny. He's also shy. 
Anyway: What I'm saying to you is this: 
It costs money, you got ten, fifteen people 
standing around, and that's just to make 
sure the lighting is right -- 
Jack continues chatting with Johnny Doe, he looks away for a moment. 
JACK'S POV: Dirk meets up with Todd Parker and they walk out the door. (40fps) 
Jack turns back to Johnny Doe. Continue a bit with party stuff/etc. Jack has his dance w/Becky.

This stuff burns. 
DIRK 
It's crystal. 
ROLLERGIRL 
That's why. Shit, why didn't you 
tell me -- you don't need to do that much -- 
You only have to do bumps with crystal. 
DIRK 
Yeah, well . . . mind your own business 
or get your own or whatever --

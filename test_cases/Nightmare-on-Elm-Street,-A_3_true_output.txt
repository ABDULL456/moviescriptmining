ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives raised.  NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past him for the door.  She makes it to safety, then turning back.  She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild with pain and fury. 
NANCY Hey fuckface -- can't catch me! 
The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY. 
194.  INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                    194. 
As NANCY clears the hall and makes the stairs, KRUEGER lurches through the shattered doorway after her. 
195.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         195. 
The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the front door, banging against it with terrified fury. 
NANCY (screaming) Come on -- he's in here! Daddy!  Don't let him kill me too! 
Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall with a horrible sound! 
NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and screams through the bars. 
NANCY (CONTD) HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!! 
KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY dives behind the couch. 
CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire. 
CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK. 
WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room. 
NANCY peeks out from behind the couch.  The man lies in a smoking heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again. 
NANCY (CONTD) Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the bastard! 
KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits. 
NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house. 
196.  OMIT                                                               196. 
197.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              197. 
She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man thundering after her. 
ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR.  NANCY brakes at the wall. Nowhere left to hide. 
THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her. 
KRUEGER Ready for these? 
198.  ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other    198. side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it straight over the head.  The heavy container shatters, showering its contents over every square inch of the man. 
He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after him with a box of kitchen matches.  Before the man can realize what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in KRUEGER's face. 
There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific BALL OF FIRE.  Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full pyrrhic rage. 
199.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     199. 
NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment. Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a great RINGING CONCUSSION.  It sends him windmilling backwards and down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and flames. 
NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home. 
No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again and again against the door from the cellar. The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK, THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED.  Then there's just silence. 
NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen. 
As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we 
CUT TO: 
200.  INT.  GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                             200. 
The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber gloves.  Pale and sweating. 
CORONER Found you something, Donald. Should remind you of something... 
The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON.  THOMPSON stares at it without touching it.  A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp, attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...

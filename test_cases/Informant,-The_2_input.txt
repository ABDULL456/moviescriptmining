49 INTERIOR HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM- CONTINUOUS 49 Whitacre buttons his shirt and puts his tie back on. He looks out the hotel room window at the snow. In the parking lot a high school kid drinks a beer while trying to write his name in urine in the snowbank. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) They're all different. Every flake is it's own one-of-a-kind version of itself. And some people still don't believe in God. I mean what more proof do you need than that-- Herndon and Shepard re-enter. 
WHITACRE Hey, how'd I do? 
SHEPARD Mark, we have some problems... 
WHITACRE Wait a minute, I watched the machine, I didn't see any changes... 
SHEPARD Mark, you don't know how to read a polygraph. 
WHITACRE I've heard these things, they're not always 100 per cent accurate. I've been telling the truth. Definitely. Herndon plays the bad cop. 
HERNDON Mark, you splattered the walls with ink. Come on now, extortionists don't just leave their name and number then go away. 
Draft; 1/15/03 48. 
Whitacre nods-- his eyes water, He sighs. 
SHEPARD (CONT'D) I know it's tough keeping it all bottled up inside, keeping it a secret. But, there's only one good choice for you. That's all there's ever been. There's something you're hiding, something you're keeping from us. But, the only way to protect yourself is to be completely honest. 
WHITACRE Okay. Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic 302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION. 
SHEPARD You realize this document can be used against you in a court of law. Whitacre nods grimly. 
HERNDON What happened with Fujiwara and the saboteur? A beat. 
WHITACRE I made it up. I had to... Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates open. Shepard transcribes the confession. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) .We've had problems at the plant with viruses, we're way behind projections. Dwayne was thinking about shutting us down and everyone was on me to fix it. 'Let's just blame it all on Whitacre.' That's how it is there. It was my job they were talking about. We just moved here from Europe-they made me VP. 
SHEPARD And the reason you agreed to help ADM purchase a new bug? 
Draft: 1/15/03 49. 
WHITACRE I wanted to be part of the team. I thought it would help my relationship with Mick if he thought I would do something like that. 
HERNDON And what about the price fixing? It isn't over is it? There's no "new attitude." 
WHITACRE 
(DEFEATED) There's been meetings all along-- in the past three weeks even. Nothing's changed... Again, Whitacre's mind allows him to be two places at once... 
WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.) 
(UNDER) (OVER) .and not just in Lysine-- Mick Andreas or his Dad? citric acid, gluconate. One They'd never lie for me. They guy, he was forced to leave say we're in it together. the company because he What a joke. Team building wouldn't do it-- the off-site meetings at the some gluconate guy...he's out of a lake in Wisconsin-- I can't job now. They had me go to protect these guys if they're Chicago and meet with the breaking the law. Hey, I guys from Ajinomoto to try tried. Anybody could see the and set volume levels for choices I had. I did my best lysine production. It's a for ADM. You don't see them matter of dividing up the here in the electric chair. market between the producers It's all "Make us lysine, and then setting a workable Mark." "Handle the FBI, price. There's another Mark." "Crap us out some meeting in about a month. money, Mark." 
SHEPARD If there's anything else you want to add, now's the time. You need to tell us. 
WHITACRE No, that's the full story. 
HERNDON We want tapes, mark. He slides the confession across to Whitacre who nods and signs. He gives both agents Christmas cards and smiles. 
Draft: 1/15/03 50. 
WHITACRE I'll give you all the tapes you want. Merry Christmas you guys. 
50 INTERIOR PARKING GARAGE ADM- MORNING 50 Whitacre aims the FERRARI into his designated parking space and gets out of the car. 
STEADICAM FOLLOWING WHITACRE He walks toward the building. As the camera arcs around to lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud-- NOT IN VO. To nobody... 
WHITACRE Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March seventeenth, 1994. I have just parked my car and am now entering the office... Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's a little off this morning... s-- WHITACRE (CONT'D) Terrance Wilson, President of our corn businesses, did you speak with our friends in Japan? 
TERRY WILSON He wasn't in. 
WHITACRE I heard from Mimoto last night-- he is pissed. He said there's not going to be any peace in lysine until we bring production down like we promised. Theelevator doors opens. 
TERRY WILSON In 92 we did exactly what we told them we would do in terms of volume. Exactly. Right now, there's no promise. 
WHITACRE He said he'd like to talk to you at some point... 
Draft: 1/15/03 51. 
L 
TERRY WILSON Be right there lookin' at him. Say, "listen here you little mousy motherfucker." Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world. 
WHITACRE That was Terry Wilson talking about setting volume and price levels with our Japanese competitor-- Ajinomoto Corporation. Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself. 
WHITACRE (CONT'D) By the way, there was no discussion with Mimoto last night. That was all for illustration purposes only. I wanna make that clear- no discussion with Mimoto last night. He turns off the tape recorder.

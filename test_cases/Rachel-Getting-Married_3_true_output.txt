KYM Here. 
RACHEL Besides I'm in my dress!

PAUL Ooo! Can I see?! 
Paul starts up the stairs. 
RACHEL/EMMA No! 
PAUL Okay, okay! 
Paul has stopped half way up the stairs. He turns to Kym, beams at her. 
PAUL Kymmie, what can I make you? 
KYM Actually there's a meeting I have to make. And I have to pee in a cup. And register as a general biohazard. 
PAUL I'll drive you. 
KYM (heading downstairs) Just tell me which car I should take. Paul doesn't say anything. Carol floats to Paul's side. 
KYM Which car? 
PAUL Would you do me a favor, Kymmie...? 
KYM I have a license... 
PAUL You wouldn't believe my insurance. And I'm not... that comfortable. Could we figure something else out?

Kym pedaling up on a bouncy, high tech racing bike that is far too big for her. She bangs herself in the crotch as she dismounts.

KYM Hello? Hello? 
Kym stops a baby-faced NURSE. 
KYM Hi. I'm here to pee in a cup. 
NURSE (over her shoulder) She needs to pee in a cup. (back to Kym) Someone will be right with you. 
KYM Okay. I'm trying to get to a meeting. 
NURSE The meetings are over in the other building. 
KYM I know that. 
NURSE Someone will be right with you. Have a seat. Several people are waiting in chairs. They look at Kym.

Randy leaves, Jack shakes Mrs. Hammen by the shoulders. 
JACK Get hold of yourself! Get hold of yourself! 
DR. RUMACK (to Jack) Get back to your seat; I'll take care of this. 
Jack leaves; Rumack shakes Mrs. Hammen by the shoulders. 
DR. RUMACK Calm down. Calm down. Get hold of yourself! 
Sister Angelina taps Rumack on the shoulder. 
SISTER ANGELINA (to Rumack) Doctor, you're wanted on the phone. 
Sister Angelina starts shaking Mrs. Hammen. 
SISTER ANGELINA Everything will be all right. Please get hold of yourself. 
We see a line of passengers behind Sister Angelina waiting to shake Mrs. Hammen.

As Kramer rushes through the lobby, he is approached by a series of religious zealots. In quick succession he decks each one karate style, shooting the last zealot twenty feet away with a .44 Magnum.

INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT 
AIR CONTROLLER #1 (into phone) This guy doing the flying has no airline experience at all. He'll be a menace to himself and everything else in the air... (he pauses to listen) ...Yes, birds too. 
Kramer enters, picks up clipboard, and reads it. 
McCROSKEY (into phone) Okay, okay. He's a terrible risk, but what other choice have we got? 
McCroskey hangs up phone. 
McCROSKEY Well, that's the whole story, Rex, everything we know. 
KRAMER All right, Steve, let's face a few facts. 
Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair of sunglasses. 
KRAMER As you know, I flew with this man, Striker, during the war. He'll have enough on his mind without remembering those days when -- well, when things weren't so good. 
McCROSKEY Well, right now things aren't so good. And while we're talking there are a hundred and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a decision. 
KRAMER Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long time ago... 
A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer. 
KRAMER ...but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's gonna fold up. 
McCROSKEY Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn and talk this guy down! You're going to have to let him get the feel of this airplane on the way; you'll have to talk him onto the approach; and so help me, you'll have to talk him right down to the ground! 
A watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the table. 
KRAMER Very well then. Put Striker on the speaker. 
McCROSKEY Okay, you can use the radio over there. Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking. 
He pulls a flask trom the drawer and takes a swig. 
INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT 
Kramer at dispatch radio. He picks up mike. 
KRAMER Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex Kramer speaking. 
McCroskey joins Kramer at dispatch radio. 
INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 
DRAMATIC MUSIC as we see Striker's ominous look of recognition. 
STRIKER (dramatically) Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and clear.

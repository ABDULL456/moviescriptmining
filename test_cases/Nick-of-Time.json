The doors start to close. \nGene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go? \nGENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard. \nBODYGUARD Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one. \nELEANOR GRANT Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters. \nShe smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE. \nELEANOR GRANT Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that. \nGENE steps aboard, shakes her hand. \nINT. \"RED ELEVATOR\" - DAY - 12:29PM \nThe elevator begins to rise. \nELEANOR GRANT Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is. \nKRISTA We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con. \nINSERT FLOOR INDICATOR \nWe are on the third floor. \nThe doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise. \nGENE Governor... \nIt comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed. \nGENE I need your help. \nELEANOR GRANT What can I do for you Mr....Watson? \nGENE Its'...ah...about my daughter.... \nThe elevator slows and stops on the next floor above. \nINSERT FLOOR INDICATOR \nWe are on the fourth floor. \nBehind GENE, the doors open. \nMR. SMITH (O.S.) Room for one more? \nGENE freezes. \nELEANOR GRANT I think we can accommodate you. \nShe offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board. \nELEANOR GRANT Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. \nMR. SMITH A pleasure to meet you, Governor. \nThe car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to GENE. \nELEANOR GRANT You were saying?  Your daughter....? \nGENE I... \nELEANOR GRANT Yes? \nANGLE ON MR SMITH \nYes??? \n", "test1_true": "What to do now? \nGENE She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. \nELEANOR GRANT Of course.  I wish everything were that easy. \nKRISTA I've got the pen if you've got the paper. \nGENE looks at her. She smiles back. \nKRISTA How about that? \nHe looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, the one MR. SMITH gave him. \nKRISTA Is that something precious? \nGENE No, that's,..that's fine \nHe gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the envelope. \nELEANOR GRANT What's her name? \nGENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt - do it! GENE pulls his eyes away. \nGENE Her name? Her name is Lynn. \nELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket. Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA talking to him. \nKRISTA It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic. \nHe gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the sweat from his face. \nKRISTA If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble. \nHe is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is. \nHe looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. There is the hint of a gun on his hip. \nGENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is the SECURITY MAN staring at him? \nELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph. \nELEANOR GRANT Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too. \nGENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to stop the shakes. \nThe doors open, startling him. \nINT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM \nELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and applause. \nGENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH. \nThe doors close and the elevator descends. \nINT. \"RED ELEVATOR\" - DAY - 12:29PM \nMR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes. \nMR. SMITH She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!? \nHis fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs GENE into a corner, physically terrified. \nMR. SMITH Are you 'fucking with me!? \nGENE The gun... \nMR. SMITH What about the gun? \nGENE It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it. \nMR. SMITH You... \nHe raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket. \nMR. SMITH You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one. \n", "test1_id": 63, "test2_input": "He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. GENE looks out and down. \nGENE'S POV \nThe van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM \nLYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES takes a look. \nMS. JONES That's pretty good. \nLYNN I've done much better ones than this. \nMS. JONES You have, huh? \nLYNN Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home. \nMS. JONES That's good. (checks her watch) That's good, sweetie pie. \nINT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM \nThe elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible. \nMR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket. \nMR. SMITH There, all loaded. Ready for the hunt. \nThe elevator, doors open into the lobby. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:29PM \nMR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping his wife with a video camera. \nVIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM \nWe see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith.  He turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a read-out of the TIME: \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM \nBack in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the Men's Room. \"Huey's Polished Act\" and below that, hand- lettered, \"Disabled Veteran\" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish black man, reads a \"Smithsonian\" magazine. \nHe sees GENE and perks up - a customer. \nHUEY Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...? \nBut GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room. \nHUEY (calling after him) You don't see your face, you don't pay! \nHUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM \nGene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes. He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  Gene spins around.  It is MR. SMITH, of course. \nMR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY \nGENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM \nHUEY sets down his magazine again. \nHUEY Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. \nIt's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. GENE looks around. \nMR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view. \nHUEY Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective. \nGENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair. \nThe gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary. \n", "test2_true": "12:45  -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant  -  Pacific Rim Multi-Cultural Conference  -  Pool Deck  -  Fourth Floor \nGENE looks at his watch. \nECU WATCH \nThe minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches. \nANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM \nHe works away at GENE's shoes. \nHUEY So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels? \nIt's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry. \nGENE I'm...I'm visiting. \nGENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand. \nHUEY What do you do, if I may be so bold? \nGENE (looking at MR. SMITH) I'm just an accountant. \nHUEY Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right? \nANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM \nHe takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair. \nANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM \nHUEY Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning \"in the middle\", but if you ask me it means \"just plain mean\". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it? \nGENE No. No, it doesn't. \nThe Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY. \nGUSTINO Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'? \nHUEY It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it. \nGUSTINO laughs, waves. \nGENE I have to do something. \nHUEY What's that? You have to speak up. (taps his ear) I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps. \nGENE I said I have to do something. \nHUEY I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail. \nGENE Is within himself. \nGENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here. She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all over the house. \nHUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his chair? \nGENE Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. She'd do something. She'd do something. \nHUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live one. \nHUEY Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks. \nHUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor. He pays HUEY with a twenty. \nHUEY You got anything smaller? \nGENE Keep it. \nHUEY It's a twenty. \nGENE Keep it. \nGENE is thinking about something. \nHUEY Well...thanks muchly... \n", "test2_id": 64, "test3_input": "HUEY (still not looking up) Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective. \nGENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine aside, swings into action... \nHUEY So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to... \n...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes. \nHUEY (as he looks up) You got a complaint? \nGENE looks down at him. \nGENE You remember me? \nHUEY I remember. The big tipper. \nGENE Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about. \nHUEY Oh, man... \nGENE Please. Something is going to happen... \nHUEY What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair. \nGENE Please... \nHUEY Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty? \nHUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. From behind him: \nMR. SMITH Come on, let's get some privacy. \nGENE He's deaf. \nIt spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at HUEY's \"Disabled Veteran\" sign. \nGENE He can't hear a word we're saying. \nMR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing - \"What the fuck?\" He almost says it aloud, then: \nMR. SMITH You wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, Mr. Watson? (to HUEY's back) Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't hear me? Nigger? \nHUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to do?  He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a jive-ass grin. \nHUEY Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that?  You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army... (does a snappy salute) ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay. \nMR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair. \nMR. SMITH (loudly) Yeah, sure, give me a shine... (looks at GENE) ...shine. \nHUEY goes to work on his shoes. \nMR. SMITH I'm putting your toy back in your pocket, Mr. Watson. \nUnseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being transferred to GENE's pocket. \nMR. SMITH It's all wound up. Now let's get out your itinerary. \nGENE does. \n\"1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century - California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and Brendan Grant\" It is the last entry. \nGENE One thirty. California Ballroom. \nMR. SMITH (glances at HUEY) That's right. That gives you... \nHe looks at his watch. \nMR. SMITH ...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together. \nGENE Let me talk to her again. \nMR. SMITH No. \nGENE I want'to talk to her. \nMR. SMITH Forget about it. \n", "test3_true": "MR.

Walk out there and twist her arm off? \nMR. SMITH doesn't reply. \nGENE It would be a lot less trouble just to let me talk to her. \nThey stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie. \nMR. SMITH (into it) Come Back. \nMS. JONES (O.S.) (filtered) Yeah. \nMR. SMITH Put her on. \nMS. JONES (O.S.) What gives? \nMR. SMITH Just put her on. \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) Daddy? \nGENE grabs the walkie-talkie. \nGENE Yes, sweetie, it's me. \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) I'm tired.

There's...there's something Daddy has to do. \nLYNN To be a hero? \nINT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM \nMR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ. \nGENE No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right? \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) All right. \nGENE He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you. \nMR. SMITH That's enough. \nHe reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down. Back to the walkie-talkie: \nGENE Will you promise me that? \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) I promise. \nGENE All right. Kisses to you. \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) No...kisses to you. \nGENE No. Kisses to you. \nLYNN (O.S.) (filtered) No, kisses to... \nMR. SMITH grabs the walkie-talkie. \nMR.

{"train": "NICK OF TIME \nWritten by \nEbbe Roe Smith & Patrick Duncan \nMarch 1995 \nFADE IN: \nINT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM \nUnion Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still grand. \nA sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main concourse-says the \"San Diegan\", number 2 64, is due at 12:00. \nSet above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter. \nTHE TIME - \nWe see the big hand slam into \"7\". \nA loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San Diego, Del Mar... \nEXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM \nThe \"San Diegan\" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, grinding stop. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine. \nDoors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura... \nINT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM \nA MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his beefy counterpart. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc... \nTHE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo... \nThen he looks up to the big clock. \nThe minute hand slams into the \"8\". \nANNOUNCER ...and points north. \nHe resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs. \nMR. SMITH Look sharp. \nThey stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the crowd. \nMS. JONES That one. \nMR. SMITH Nah.  Hates his wife. \nThey're talking about a couple in their forties.  She motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband follows with the suitcases. \nWHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by. \nMS. JONES I hate rollerblades. \nEXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM \nThe train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within the train: \nGENE Lynn!  Lynn!! \nGENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her. \nGENE Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK? \nLYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at the big clock. \nGENE Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call. \nINT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM \nMR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE. \nWHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on the couple. \nMR. SMITH Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.- \nMS. JONES Young love. \nThe couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows. \nMR. SMITH (sotto voce) Foreigners! Fuck! \nMS. JONES Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they? \nMR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with. \nINT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM \nGENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has wandered a few yards away. \nGENE Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey! \nHe reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, one on each side, too close for a father's comfort. \nGENE Watch that! Lynn, come here! \nShe does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. MR. SMITH has noticed GENE. \nGENE at the phone. \nGENE Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late. \nThe TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand- filled ashtray next to him. \nGENE Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now. \nHe hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS. \nGENE (to LYNN) Ready? \nLYNN Nods. \nGENE Let' s do it. \nHe picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing nasty things to knees and wrists. \nGENE Whoops. \nHe stands over them with LYNN. \nGENE Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right? \nLYNN Right. \nANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM \nMR. SMITH Perfect. \nHe starts forward. \nMS. JONES (not so sure) Perfect. \nShe follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge. \nMR. SMITH Could I see some identification, sir? \nGENE What? \nMS. JONES (ditto with the badge) I.D. Could we see some? \nGENE Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do? \nBullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see... \nThe van is gone! \nANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM \nHe stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step. \nA LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her. \nLITTLE GIRL Mama! \nShe pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder. \nUntil a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station. \nIt's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more confident. \nThen, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in behind him speaking in his ear. \nMR. SMITH You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. (into walkie-talkie) Do it. \nMS. JONES (O.S.) (filtered) Go ahead, sugar Die. \nLYNN (V.O.) (filtered) Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling Daddy. Come in, Daddy. \nGENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man. \nGENE Lynn! \nLYNN (V.O.) (filtered) I can hear you good. Can you hear me? \nGENE Yes. Yes, I can hear you. \nMR. SMITH That's enough. \nMS. JONES (V.O.) (filtered) 'Daddy has to go now. \nLYNN (filtered) He has to say \"over and out\". Daddy, you have to say \"over and out\". \nGENE Over and out. \nMR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie. \nMR. SMITH Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it! \nGENE (softly) At one thirty my little girl is dead. \nMR. SMITH Unless you do what you're told. Go do it! \nHe pushes GENE on, toward a cab. \nMR. SMITH And don't forget I'll be watching you. \nGENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the stand. \nEXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM \nThe CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab. \nCABBIE Where to, sir? \nGENE The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is? \nThe CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into the cab. \nINT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM \nThe CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped by: \nCABBIE Amtrack? \nGENE What? \nCABBIE You just come in on Amtrack? \nGENE Uh, yes.. \nELEANOR GRANT Somebody did. \nKRISTA turns to an Aide. \nKRIST A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems. \nThe elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to close. \nGene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go? \nGENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard. \nBODYGUARD Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one. \nELEANOR GRANT Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters. \nShe smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE. \nELEANOR GRANT Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that. \nGENE steps aboard, shakes her hand. \nINT. \"RED ELEVATOR\" - DAY - 12:29PM \nThe elevator begins to rise. \nELEANOR GRANT Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is. \nKRISTA We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con. \nINSERT FLOOR INDICATOR \nWe are on the third floor. \nThe doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise. \nGENE Governor... \nIt comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed. \nGENE I need your help. \nELEANOR GRANT What can I do for you Mr....Watson? \nGENE Its'...ah...about my daughter.... \nThe elevator slows and stops on the next floor above. \nINSERT FLOOR INDICATOR \nWe are on the fourth floor. \nBehind GENE, the doors open. \nMR. SMITH (O.S.) Room for one more? \nGENE freezes. \nELEANOR GRANT I think we can accommodate you. \nShe offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board. \nELEANOR GRANT Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. \nMR. SMITH A pleasure to meet you, Governor. \nThe car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to GENE. \nELEANOR GRANT You were saying?  Your daughter....? \nGENE I... \nELEANOR GRANT Yes? \nANGLE ON MR SMITH \nYes??? \nHe indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. GENE looks out and down. \nGENE'S POV \nThe van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM \nLYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES takes a look. \nMS. JONES That's pretty good. \nLYNN I've done much better ones than this. \nMS. JONES You have, huh? \nLYNN Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home. \nMS. JONES That's good. (checks her watch) That's good, sweetie pie. \nINT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM \nThe elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible. \nMR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket. \nMR. SMITH There, all loaded. Ready for the hunt. \nThe elevator, doors open into the lobby. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:29PM \nMR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping his wife with a video camera. \nVIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM \nWe see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith.  He turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a read-out of the TIME: \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM \nBack in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the Men's Room. \"Huey's Polished Act\" and below that, hand- lettered, \"Disabled Veteran\" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish black man, reads a \"Smithsonian\" magazine. \nHe sees GENE and perks up - a customer. \nHUEY Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...? \nBut GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room. \nHUEY (calling after him) You don't see your face, you don't pay! \nHUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM \nGene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes. He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  Gene spins around.  It is MR. SMITH, of course. \nMR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY \nGENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM \nHUEY sets down his magazine again. \nHUEY Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. \nIt's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. GENE looks around. \nMR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view. \nHUEY Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective. \nGENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair. \nThe gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary. \nGENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket. \nGENE Can I get out to Flower Street from here? \nHUEY Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there. \nHUEY nods toward the bar. \nGENE Thanks. \nGENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for the boys in white. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM \nGENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is still there. A bus pulls up. \nGENE walks past MR. SMITH. \nMR. SMITH You get another chance in ten minutes. \nGENE Then I have time for a drink. \nHe heads up to the bar. \nMR. SMITH All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just one. I don't want you... \nBut GENE is long gone. \nINT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM \nGENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked. \nREPORTER So where was I? \nBARTENDER I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime. \nGENE hears this and glances towards them. \nREPORTER Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers. \nGENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street. \nREPORTER The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations. \nThe BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and out the smaller door onto Flower Street. \nREPORTER We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest. \nEXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM \nGENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving through the traffic. \nOnce across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab. \nNo MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks out the gun. \nINT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM \nThe first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead. \nGENE (a gasp) Lynn! \nMS. JONES (O.S.) Shhh. You'll wake the baby up. \nMS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles. \nMS. JONES (softly) What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, \"What's behind the seat?\"  Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison? \nGENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. He lowers the gun, defeated. \nMS. JONES Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see. \nEXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY \nGENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM \nKrista looks at Gene. \nKRISTA Yes, you're right, I don't understand. \nGENE Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me. \nKrista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help. \nKRISTA Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our... \nGene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, unnoticed by anyone else. \nGENE (sotto voce) No! You have to listen to me. \nKrista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene. \nKRISTA I'm listening, I'm listening. \nANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM \nELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming LOCAL POLITICO. \nELEANOR GRANT My friends, my good friends... \nANGLE ON THE CROWD \nGene and Krista are gone. \nEXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM \nHidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause. \nGENE Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter.  They want me to kill Eleanor Grant \u0097 or they'll kill my daughter. \nKRISTA tries to edge away. \nKRISTA All right, let's just...let's get security in on this. \nGENE No! You can't! They're in on it. \nKRISTA I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked. \nGENE I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd... \nGENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her. \nGENE Look, how did I get in here with this!? \nKRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact. \nKRISTA I don't know. \nGENE You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me. \nKRISTA It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances. \nGENE looks at her intently. \nGENE You're right, it is. (beat) Here. \nGENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers. \nGENE Will you trust me now? \nShe stares at the gun, at the strange man. \nKRISTA I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to. \nGENE The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. \nKRISTA He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute. \nShe steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S voice is heard. \nELEANOR GRANT (O.S.) ...I remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. A phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news... \nKRISTA checks her watch. \nShe grabs GENE and pushes inside. \nINT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM \nUpscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair. KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE. \nGENE (to KRISTA) We have to hurry. \nKRISTA I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor. \nBRENDAN GRANT What? What are you talking about? \nKRISTA We need people we can \"trust. We only have a few moments... \nBRENDAN GRANT This is...this is insane. How do you know this? \nGENE I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her. \nBRENDAN GRANT You are!? (to KRISTA) You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!? \nKRISTA I had to. Her Security people may be involved... \nThere is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, perhaps wearing glasses. \nMYSTERY MAN Is there a problem, Brendan? \nBRENDAN GRANT There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor. \nGENE Not hired. They're blackmailing me. \nMYSTERY MAN Who is this \"they\"? \nGENE I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble.  Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen... \nMYSTERY MAN And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks?  I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me... \nKRISTA He brought a gun onto the pool deck. \nMYSTERY MAN (beat) What? \nKRISTA He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a \nMYSTERY MAN I see. Where is this gun? \nKRISTA I Have it. \nMYSTERY MAN Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it? \nKRISTA It looks real. I don't know anything about guns. \nMYSTERY MAN Could I see it? \nKRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it awkwardly, examines it. \nMYSTERY MAN My goodness. It certainly looks real. \nHe looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite. \nMYSTERY MAN What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly. \nGENE turns, to see who he is talking to. \nANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM \nMR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch. He takes the gun, shoves\" it- into the pillow and goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills. \nBRENDAN GRANT Jesus Christ! \nMR. SMITH (calmly, staring at GENE) Yeah, I'd say it's real. \nMYSTERY MAN Are you out of your fucking mind!? \nThe door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly. \nOFFICER TRUST Somebody mind telling me... (sees KRISTA's body)) What the hell happened!? \nMR. SMITH Help me get her off the rug. \nMR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through with this. \nMYSTERY MAN It's too late for that. \nBRENDAN GRANT There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor! \nMYSTERY MAM What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge. \nBRENDAN GRANT (breathing easier) Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker. \nOFFICER TRUST He won't be doing any work once I get through with him. \nMYSTERY MAN And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they could. \nBRENDAN GRANT laughs. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM \nOFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the other way, walk. In an undertone: \nGENE I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work. \nMR. SMITH Do you now, Mr. Watson? \nGENE I kill her - and you kill me. \nMR. SMITH Keep your voice down. \nGENE Even if you don't, Her Security men will. \nINT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 12:58PM \nThey reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE turns on him. \nGENE How am I supposed to get away? \nMR. SMITH That's not my problem, Mr. Watson \nHe gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it. \nMR. SMITH (into the walkie-talkie) Come back. \nGENE How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone? \nMR. SMITH (into the walkie-talkie) Come Back....Fucking Radio. \nMR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys off, hisses at GENE: \nMR.SMITH I told you she'd be alright, if you do your job. \nGENE And I'm supposed to trust you? \nMR. SMITH What choice do you have? \nThe elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously. \nMR. SMITH After you. \nINT. \"BLUE\" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM \nThey step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR. SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear. \nMR. SMITH Look out there! You see the van? \nThe van can be seen below on Flower Street. \nMR. SMITH You see it?! \nWHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up the walkie-talkie. \nMR. SMITH Come back. \nMS. JONES (V.O.) (filtered) Yeah. \nMR. SMITH Do it! \nHe jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear. \nHUEY (still not looking up) Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective. \nGENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine aside, swings into action... \nHUEY So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to... \n...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes. \nHUEY (as he looks up) You got a complaint? \nGENE looks down at him. \nGENE You remember me? \nHUEY I remember. The big tipper. \nGENE Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about. \nHUEY Oh, man... \nGENE Please. Something is going to happen... \nHUEY What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair. \nGENE Please... \nHUEY Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty? \nHUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. From behind him: \nMR. SMITH Come on, let's get some privacy. \nGENE He's deaf. \nIt spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at HUEY's \"Disabled Veteran\" sign. \nGENE He can't hear a word we're saying. \nMR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing - \"What the fuck?\" He almost says it aloud, then: \nMR. SMITH You wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, Mr. Watson? (to HUEY's back) Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't hear me? Nigger? \nHUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to do?  He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a jive-ass grin. \nHUEY Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that?  You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army... (does a snappy salute) ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay. \nMR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair. \nMR. SMITH (loudly) Yeah, sure, give me a shine... (looks at GENE) ...shine. \nHUEY goes to work on his shoes. \nMR. SMITH I'm putting your toy back in your pocket, Mr. Watson. \nUnseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being transferred to GENE's pocket. \nMR. SMITH It's all wound up. Now let's get out your itinerary. \nGENE does. \n\"1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century - California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and Brendan Grant\" It is the last entry. \nGENE One thirty. California Ballroom. \nMR. SMITH (glances at HUEY) That's right. That gives you... \nHe looks at his watch. \nMR. SMITH ...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together. \nGENE Let me talk to her again. \nMR. SMITH No. \nGENE I want'to talk to her. \nMR. SMITH Forget about it. \nHUEY Just about. \nHe gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away. \nHUEY Two dollars, if it pleases you. \nMR. SMITH It doesn't. I remember when it was a fuckin' quarter. \nHe throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks away: \nMR. SMITH Twenty-five minutes. \nTO HIS BACK: \nHUEY Thanks for the tip. \nHUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other. \nHUEY Mister, what are you dragging me into? \nGENE I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect... \nHUEY Cover your mouth. \nGENE What? \nHUEY This gorilla's watching you, is that right? \nGENE That's right. \nHUEY Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off. \nGENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY pretends to work on his shoes. \nHUEY That was your kid on the walkie- talkie? \nGENE My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them. \nHUEY In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom. \nGENE There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her. \nHUEY What are you supposed to do? \nGENE Kill the Governor. \nHUEY checks his perimeters, then: \nHUEY I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation? \nGENE One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it. \nHUEY Who? \nGENE The Governor. If I could just talk to her... \nHUEY Oh, Jesus ... \nGENE No way, there's nothing you can do to help me. \nHUEY Then why'd you drag me into it? \nGENE (getting emotional) It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl. \nHe gets out her picture, stares at it. \nGENE It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. \nHUEY Yeah, all right, listen... \nGENE (running on) So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... \nHUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot, snapping him from his downward spiral. \nHUEY Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time? \nGENE I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that. \nGENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him. \nBARTENDER Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop. \nMR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves. \nT.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Left field bleachers heard from. \nT.V. REPORTER Laughs. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM \nMR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST comes up behind him. \nOFFICER TRUST Where is he? Did you lose him? \nMR. SMITH Shut up. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM \nElsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be clocks everywhere. \nA. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris. \nThe souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the logos of various LA sports teams. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM \nThe restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have clocks. \nEverywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch. \n1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick over one number in a thunderous chorus. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM \nHe's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the chair - \"Gone to Lunch\" and there is a clock face with moveable hands. \"We'll be back at 1:30.\" \nGENE (sotto voice) Let's all hope so. \nAnd he enters the Men's Room. \nAcross the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM \nGENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs to the door, keeping a lookout. \nHUEY Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade with Gustino. The big guy's coming. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM \nMR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM \nHUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, uncomfortable, to say the least. \nHUEY C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy. \nGENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small for GUSTINO. \nGUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door. \nHUEY comes back from the door. \nHUEY Gustino! Drop 'em! \nGUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's pants still up. He drops them. \nHUEY And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you? \nHUEY leads GENE to another door. \"Service Personnel Only\". He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in. \nHis eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles. \nMR. SMITH smirks and leaves. \nINT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM \nHALL OFFICER looks suspiciously, and finally sits back down. \nINT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY \nGENE uses the key to let himself into \nINT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM \nLit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands over her, not knowing how to begin. \nGENE (softly) Excuse me... \nELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes. \nELEANOR GRANT Who the hell are you? \nShe sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting his hand on top of hers on top of the phone. \nGENE No, please. \nThey stare at each other for a beat. \nShe bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up to the bed. \nEleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not fearless. \nGENE Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you. \nELEANOR GRANT My security people are right next door. \nGENE I appreciate that. \nELEANOR GRANT One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over. \nGENE If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already. \nELEANOR GRANT That's...a comfort to hear. \nGENE I have a problem. \nELEANOR GRANT Ah. \nGENE Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant. \nShe studies him. \nELEANOR GRANT I remember you...in the elevator. \nGENE That's right. \nELEANOR GRANT You were very nervous. \nGENE It was because I had this...in my pocket \nHe slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in. \nGENE I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say. \nShe smiles. \nELEANOR GRANT (friendly as can be) Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time. \nVery slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of constituent... \nGENE Krista Brooks is dead. \nShe freezes, slowly replaces the phone. \nELEANOR GRANT How do you know that? \nGENE I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun. \nShe turns to him. \nELEANOR GRANT You shot her? \nELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging the room into blackness. \nELEANOR GRANT (in the blackness) Franco! Franco.' \nGENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes in, pulling a gun. \nINT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM \nThe HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite \nINT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY \nGENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the button. \nINT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM \nELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame. \nFRANCO What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!? \nShe hesitates. \nELEANOR GRANT I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, Franco. \nINT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM \nThe service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light. \nHUEY Well? \nGENE I don't know. \nHUEY What are you going to do now? \nGENE I don't know. I have to get back. \nGENE keeps moving fast.  HUEY limps to keep up \nHUEY What are you going to do!? \nGENE This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. \nHUEY watches him disappear. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM \nMR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the bar with their equipment. \nOFFICER TRUST (O.S.) (alarmed) Where is he? \nMR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him. \nMR. SMITH In the john. \nHe looks at his watch. \nOFFICER TRUST Get moving. \nMR. SMITH You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control. \nOFFICER TRUST It's time. It's time now. \nMR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM \nA different watch. The minute hand moves to: \nIt is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car. \nLYNN Where are we going? \nMS. JONES Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all. \nShe pulls the van out into traffic. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM \nBRENDAN GRANT Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. \nELEANOR GRANT You sent my assistant on an errand. \nBRENDAN GRANT (trying to look sheepish) I've been a bad boy. \nANGLE ON ELEANOR \nIt was not what she wanted to hear. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:26PM \nMr. Smith pushes Gene toward the escalators. \nINT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM \nAll sorts of MEDIA PEOPLE hover around, CAMPAIGN WORKERS wearing political buttons and REGULAR FOLKS round out the crowd. People are eating, drinking, and talking. \nThere are a couple of bars, one at each end of the room. Dessert tables are strategically placed around the room. On the speaker's platform at one end is a podium with some chairs arranged behind it. \nOne of the POLITICO'S takes the podium microphone. \nPOLITICO Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our Governor. Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. Brendan Grant. \nThe crowd applauds warmly. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM \nGENE and MR. SMITH move down the hall, following the signs to the California Ballroom. The entrance to it looms ahead. \nINT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM \nBRENDAN GRANT at the podium. \nBRENDAN GRANT Ladies and gentlemen of the press, campaign volunteers, and those of you who were looking for any excuse to take off work for the afternoon... \nPolite laughter. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM \nGENE is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our friend, the SECURITY MAN with the metal detector. He gives MR. SMITH a nod over GENE's shoulder and sends GENE to join the crowd beyond. \nINT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:28PM \nVIEW THROUGH CAMERA \nThe Video Camera clumsily tracks past the CROWD, and comes tosettle on GENE who is walking into the room, not quite sure where he is going. \nUP ON THE PODIUM: \nBRENDAN GRANT We have with us today the first woman Governor of our great state... \nGENE is pushing forward into the crowd. He looks back, seems surprised, begins turning, searching for someone as: \nBRENDAN GRANT Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What can I say about her....that won't get me in trouble when I get home tonight. \nLaughter. \nLose the video camera effect. \nANGLE ON GENE - 1:28PM \nGENE, in the midst of the crowd, can't locate MR. SMITH. Confusion clouds his face. \nHe finds himself near the T.V.TECHNICIAN from the bar. The TECHNICIAN is talking into a walkie-talkie. \nT.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you reading me? \nHe gets nothing but static. GENE's eyes move to the back of the room. \nBRENDAN GRANT She's a woman who loves our great state. \nT.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN Charlie... (gives it up) I can't get shit on this stupid radio. \nGENE looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back. \nBRENDAN GRANT A brilliant legislator. \nANGLE ON GENE \nHe looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking very dead. \nHe careens toward a door. \nANGLE ON PODIUM \nOn the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays, half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered with blood. \nBRENDAN GRANT My God, he did it! \nThe Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath.  Her eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst suspicions confirmed. \nBRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and fear on his face. \nINT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY \nGENE bursts through a door. He is followed speedily by OFFICER TRUST. \nOFFICER TRUST You little son of a bitch. \nHis attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness. The HUGE DISH PLATE CART, fully loaded, comes flying toward them pushed by GUSTINO. The cart smashes into OFFICER TRUST, throwing him against a wall, dishes clatter and smash. \nGENE raises a hand to the darkness and takes off. \nINT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY \nThe dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes flutter open. \nELEANOR GRANT Are you all right, Franco? \nFRANCO (painfully) I'd be better if they'd put sleeves on these damn vests. \nShe touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands. Their eyes lock. It's curtains for BRENDAN. \nEXT. HOTEL TAXI STAND - DAY \nThe van pulls into a waiting area. \nINT. LOBBY - NEAR SHOESHINE STAND - DAY \nHuey turns and spots a van arriving outside the hotel. He realizes who it could be. \nINT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM \nGENE 'bangs out of a door, comes to a failing and sees: \nMR. SMITH has reached the spiral stairway. He starts down it, two and three steps at a time. \nGENE moves along the railing. \nMR. SMITH is a whole floor below him. He looks up, sees GENE and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth. \nGENE pockets the gun climbs the parapet. And jumps! \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM \nGENE lands right on top of MR. SMITH. The walkie-talkie flies over the railing and into the water of the central fountain. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:30PM \nMS. JONES (on the walkie talkie) It's time....You read me?  I don't hear from you I'm going ahead now. \nCHECKS HER WATCH: \nINT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:31PM \nMR. SMITH and GENE roll down the steps, fighting. MR. SMITH basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue on. GENE somehow pulls himself up and tackles MR. SMITH. He gets in a few lucky shots before MR. SMITH overpowers him, beats him again finally .sending him flying into the fountain pool. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:31PM \nMS JONES looks to the back seat at LYNN. \nLYNN Why do you keep looking at me? \nMS. JONES That's my job. I'm your babysitter. \nMS. JONES Fuck you! \nShe loses it, hauls out her cannon. \nBAM! \nHUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie- talkie.. \nMS. JONES Gimme that thing! \nHUEY's wounded leg is twisted under him. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY \nLynn is terrified by the gunfire and looks for someplace to go. \nEXT. THE VAN - DAY \nMS. Jones jumps on the wounded HUEY who is stunned but bravely clutches the Walkie Talkie under him. \nMS. JONES Goddammit, give it to me, you Sunnavabitch! \nShe sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away from her, but she's really tough...and mad.  The gun fires wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street. \nINT. THE VAN - DAY \nLYNN tries to open the van door to escape. The van's door flies open. MR. SMITH stands there, gun in hand.- \nMR. SMITH Daddy blew it. \nHe points the gun. Lynn jumps back in terror and clambers back in the van.  She goes over the seat as he FIRES... \nThe back window SHATTERS. \nMR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat. This time he won't miss. \nLYNN has nowhere to hide. \nBAM! BAM! \nBut it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised, wide-eyed. He pivots... \nEXT. TAXI STAND - DAY \n...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR. SMITH'S gun slides from his hand. \nMR. SMITH Very good...Mr. Watson. I told them...I could make a killer out of you. \nHe drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face. \nANGLE ON GENE \nHe rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to pick Lynn up. \nANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY \nShe has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside the van. \nHUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the side of her head. She is knocked aside and out. \nHUEY There's nothing like a good wing- tip. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - LATER - 2:26PM \nAt HUEY's shoe-shine stand, GENE and HUEY sit in the shoe- shining chairs. They are variously bandaged. LYNN is on GENE'S lap. She clings to him, .her face buried against him. \nThey are guarded by COPS. \nHUEY What time is it? \nGENE looks at his wrist, gives an ironic smile. \nGENE Lost my watch. \nA hub bub catches their attention. \nANGLE ON LOBBY AREA-BELOW - 2:26PM \n", "test1_input": "MS. JONES Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that? \nLYNN Everybody does? \nMS. JONES Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out. \nShe puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in end. \nMS. JONES This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack! \nLYNN Laughs. \nMS. JONES It goes in that little hole. \nLYNN Let me do it. \nShe plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN gets a big smile on her face. \nLYNN (loudly) It's loud! \nShe goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, etc., oblivious to all else. \nMS JONES Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters. \nMR. SMITH Let's get down to business. \nGENE Who are you? You're not the police. \nMS. JONES Brilliant. \nMS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. It hurts. \nMR. SMITH Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt. \nGENE You wouldn't... \nMS. JONES Try us. \nHe looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair. \nGENE Get your hands off her. \nHe makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder. \nMR. SMITH Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand that? \nGENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having a hard time focussing. \nShe slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. SMITH Do you understand? \nGENE Yes, yes, I understand. \nMR. SMITH Good. \nHe takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in GENE'S lap. \nMR. SMITH This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson? \nGENE Yes, I'm listening. \nMR. SMITH She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here. \nHe gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises. \nMR. SMITH When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this. \nMR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun. \nMR. SMITH ...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that? \nIt takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain. \nGENE You're out of your mind. \nMR. SMITH What's your point? \nGENE I will do no such thing. \n", "test1_true": "A \"snap!\" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken a carrot stick. She breaks another. \nMS. JONES Don't worry. We'll take good care of the kid. \nShe gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking his watch. \nMR. SMITH It is now 12:16. If the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30... (holds up a walkie- talkie) ...I call my partner, your daughter is dead. \nHe looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES. \nMR. SMITH And what happens if I don't call you? \nMS. JONES I kill her anyway. \nMR. SMITH Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you understand? \nHe taps the manila envelope. \nMR. SMITH The woman in the picture... \nHe indicates the back seat with his head. \nMR. SMITH ...or your daughter. \nGENE looks at his daughter. \nGENE Oh, my God... \nMR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope into GENE'S pockets. \nMR. SMITH God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her. \nMS. JONES Only you. \nMR. SMITH You're wasting time. \nHe reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out, then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to undo her seatbelt. \nLYNN Where is my daddy going? \nMS. JONES wraps a big arm around her. \nMS. JONES He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero. \nLYNN My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers? \nMS. JONES Just like Power Rangers. \nEXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM \nMR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it. \nMR. SMITH Let's test this thing. You on? \nHe holds it up for GENE to hear. \nMS. JONES (O.S.) (filtered) Reading you. \nMR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket. \nMR. SMITH You'11 need some cash. (re: the wallet) I'll hang onto this for the time being. Oh, and... \nHe grabs one of GENE's hands. \nMR. SMITH You'll need these. \nHe dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas Regal bag. \nMR. SMITH Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a wastin'. \nGENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him a shove away from the van and into the midst of... \nEXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM \n...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream. \nAmid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the \n", "test1_id": 63, "test2_input": "The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it up. \nEXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM \nGENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what it is. He looks around. \nVALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and going. No one pays particular attention to him. \nGENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away. \nGENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it. \nMR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE goes into the hotel. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM \nGENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air- conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance. \nHIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM \nSuddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by someone high above. \nCLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM \nGENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he starts tracking all around him, seeing...something. \nGENE Oh, my God. Oh, no. \nHe desperately fumbles in his pocket. \nFacing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a huge, rolled up banner. \nGENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of it in your best red, white, and blue: \n\"RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR\" \nAnd an addendum: \n\"HERE TODAY!\" \nGENE Oh, shit. \nIt dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. \nOn some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several years her junior. These have the caption, \"Governor Grant and husband Brendan\". \nGENE Oh, sweet Jesus... \nHis eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, walkie-talkie in hand, watching him. \nGENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and gives GENE a move of the head - \"Get to it.\" \nGENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him, then slides out the itinerary. \nThe itinerary says \"California Educators' Association - 12:00 noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant\". \nGENE checks his watch. \nHe looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays. \nGENE Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is? \nGUSTINO points up. \nGUSTINO Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs. \nGENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns back. \nGENE Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. \nGUSTINO smiles. \nGUSTINO No problem. \nINT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - \"YELLOW STAIRWELL\" - DAY - 12:26PM \nGENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs. \n", "test2_true": "The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene ascends. \nGENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination. \nINT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM \nGENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room.  He walks that way. MR. SMITH follows. \nINT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM \nGENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS. \nGENE plows on through... \n...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT. \nBRENDAN GRANT (laughs) Whoops! \nThe two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN, earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man. \nBRENDAN GRANT Nice body check. \nHe continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION. \nBRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel, and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it into a positive force. \nHe slides a familiar hand around her waist. \nBRENDAN GRANT You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right. \nAnd he is hustled away. Right past an election poster featuring him and Governor Grant. \nStill stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches the Governor's husband, but keeps walking. \nINT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM \nIt is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes in. \nA WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's just copped. \nGENE Excuse me, is the...thing over? \nWOMAN Yes. You didn't miss much. The food...chicken again. \nGENE Eleanor Grant is gone? \nWOMAN Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these... \nBut GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing through a combination of relief and agony. \nMR. SMITH is suddenly next to him. \nMR. SMITH Check your itinerary. Move along. \nGENE gets out the itinerary. \"12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY - Bona Vista Lounge\". \nGENE This says \"invitation only\". \nMR. SMITH Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you. \nMR SMITH digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens it to Gene's lapel. \nMR. SMITH This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor. \nGENE Where did you get these? Who are you? \nMR. SMITH I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving. \nINT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE \"RED\" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM \nGENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage!  She is a handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the elevator. KRISTA pushes the button. \nELEANOR GRANT They-didn't hear a word I said. The mike was too low on the podium. \nKRISTA How much did we pay for that room? \nCHIEF AIDE We didn't. \n", "test2_id": 64, "test3_input": "MR. SMITH (O.S.) I know what you're thinking. \nGENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it. \nGENE What would you do in my place? \nMR. SMITH Me? \nHe flips the walkie-talkie, catches it. \nMR. SMITH The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch. \nHe flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie- talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below. \nMR. SMITH goes ballistic. \nGENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST. \nGENE There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun. \nOFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE. \nOFFICER TRUST So do you, Mr. Watson. \nAnd OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie- Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH. \nOFFICER TRUST You got this under control? \nMR. SMITH Yeah. \nOFFICER TRUST It doesn't look like it. \nMR. SMITH It's under control. \nOFFICER TRUST It better be. \nOFFICER TRUST walks away. \nMR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie- talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him to an isolated corner. \nMR. SMITH I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur. \nWAITER M (O.S.) Gentlemen... \nThe WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres. \nMR. SMITH Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker. \nGENE shakes his head. \nMR. SMITH Have a cracker, Mr. Watson. \nGENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on. \nMR. SMITH There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch. \nWe see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting. \nMR. SMITH Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why. \nGENE What...? \nMR. SMITH Tell me why I miss him. \nGENE He's dead? \nMR. SMITH That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. \nGENE How should I...? \nMR. SMITH Tell me why he's dead. \nGENE stares at him for a beat. \nGENE You killed him. \nMR. SMITH That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved. \n", "test3_true": "MR. SMITH I loved that motherfucker but I got the call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. I'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat. \nA wave of applause catches their attention. \nANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT \nShe and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way. \nANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM \nHe turns' back to GENE. \nMR. SMITH Do what you're supposed to do. Do it now. \nHe grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the mob. He searches, trying to spot him. \nMR. SMITH Shit! \nANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM \nIn the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on something ahead: \nIt is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this way and that, greeting supporters. \nGENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at the end of his rope. He is going to do it. \nANGLE ON ROSTRUM \nA local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone. \nLOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor of Los Angeles.  The honorable Tom Bradley. \nThe CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his way forward. \nTOM BRADLEY It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you... \nANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM \nHe is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD. \nTOM BRADLEY ...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind. \nGENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and... \nKRISTA (O.S.) Feeling better? \nKRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion. \nTOM BRADLEY An iconoclast with class... \nKRISTA The elevator. You weren't feeling well. \nGENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. \nTOM BRADLEY A genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches... \nKRISTA Are you better now? \nGENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH. \nTOM BRADLEY ...and go to the mat with greedy special interests... \nGENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit unnerved. \nTOM BRADLEY The finest Governor our state has ever had... \nAgain GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around, facing the crowd, facing him. \nTOM BRADLEY My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant! \nELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks. \nGENE My wife always said I had a problem trusting people. \nKRISTA Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant. \nGENE You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me. \n", "test3_id": 65}

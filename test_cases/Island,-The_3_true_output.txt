LINCOLN LEAPING ONTO THE FENCE - scrambling up the link - the dark giant momentarily off-guard - HE VAULTS OVER THE TOP -- 
- T H U D - BURDON SPINS ROUND - takes the full brunt of Lincoln's impact - overbalancing - THEY CRASH TO THE GROUND - 
LINCOLN STRUGGLES UPRIGHT - winded, but forced to face the dark giant - who is already on his feet, his mighty fist SWINGING OUT- 
- T H U D - LINCOLN TAKES A PUNCH TO THE JAW - recoils, reciprocates throwing a left hook - hitting hard but the giant barely flinches- 
-THUD-THUD- BURDON POUNDS INTO HIM - a storm of punches - his quarry, ducking and blocking - now backed up against the fence-- Ester RETRIEVING THE THUNDERBOLT - trying to work the mechanism - coughing - hands shaking - accidentally touching the trigger - 
- B O O M - THE SHOT BLASTS INTO THE AIR - enough of a distraction for Lincoln - he lands the giant with A BONE-JARRING LEFT HOOK- B U R D O N KEELS OVER INTO THE WALL - cracking the back of his head - his knees buckling - sliding down - just catching sight of-- 
LINCOLN AND ESTER SCRAMBLING UP OVER THE FENCE - and then the quarry is lost from sight in A DOWNPOUR OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS. 
134   EXT . BACKSTREET - NIGHT 
S I R E N S WAILING IN THE DISTANCE. Lincoln and Ester race down the sidewalk, along a construction hoarding. Ester slows, doubling over, rasping. Lincoln looks at her, her l i p s , blue, her face, pale. The sirens, getting louder. He sees a gap in the hoarding- 
135   EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT 
Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract. A once public park, now a construction site. Mounds and craters of earth. Dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons. Patches of parkland, as yet untouched. Bowed palms, dead grass, a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. On its shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse. 
136   INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT 
The refuge of shadow. The collapsed   roof allowing streams and puddles of moonlight. Lincoln helps     Ester onto a rotted bench. She slumps down, exhausted, Lincoln     watches her, helplessly. She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps. 
ESTER I can't... I can't breathe... my throat... it's so... dry... 
LINCOLN I ' l l find you some water. 
He looks around blindly. Some junk in the corner. He rummages, finds a rusted metal box. Pries it open, empties the contents. Gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle. He opens it, sniffs. It smells pungent. Alcohol, not water. Ester suddenly starts sobbing. Lincoln returns to her side- 
LINCOLN I t ' s going to be okay, Ester. 
ESTER N o . . . no, it isn't... 
LINCOLN I ' l l find you some water, okay? 
Ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes- 
ESTER An d then what, Lincoln? 
LINCOLN I ' l l find another way. Out of state. 
ESTER An d then what? What if they find us? 
LINCOLN The n we'll keep going. 
ESTER I can't... I can't run anymore... 
Ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. Pitiful to watch. Lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate- 
LINCOLN We ' l l keep going till we get there. 
Ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her- 
ESTER The Island... You mean, The Island? 
Lincoln answers with a brief smile. If this will keep her going then the truth is redundant. He eases her out of the moment- 
LINCOLN N o w I'm going to get some water. But I want you to stay here. It'll be safer. 
Ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. Her breaths, calming. 
ESTER Don't go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln. Stay with me for a little while. 
Lincoln looks puzzled by Ester's request. Even more puzzled as she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. He feels her against him. The warmth spreading through him again. His arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her. I t feels right somehow. And there he stays, holding her, looking out across the dereliction. And the moon rises over Encanto P a r k . 
137   EXT. METRO PD STATION - NIGHT 
The holoform l o g o of The Metro PD glows over the threshold. Diggs exits with a dark glower. The cutter is waiting kerbside. 
138   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic. The thrill o f the chase is gone from them now. Both seem equally grim and determined. Diggs taps the holocom. A holoframe resolves, snows with static. Then Janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter- 
JANEEN (ON HOLOCOM) What the fuck do you want now? 
DIGGS (very calm, very cold) Punch into the currency stream, close the net on downtown and keep the search active. The next time they use the card, I want to be right on top of them... 
O f f his icy tone, Janeen nods without retort. Diggs hits a key and her face blinks out. And the cutter prowls into the night. 
139   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT 
The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". Another franchise on a more downtrodden street. Lincoln emerges with a bag of food and drink. He considers the blue card. The reservoir, now close to the bottom, his resources almost exhausted. With a look of foreboding, he pockets the card and turns the corner. An d suddenly stops in his tracks. But it's not a vehicle that he sees. Or a predator. His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard: 
- - A football player in montage; pummeling into a defensive line; running for a touchdown; gyrating in the endzone; spinning in an NFL podium shot, super; "Nobody Stops The Juggernaut!"; a team logo, super; "Come See The Phoenix Admirals! Rulers of the AFC!" Lincoln recognizes the player's face but it's not possible. He waits for the loop to restart. There it is again. The face of Starkweather Two-Delta. Incredulous, he stops a pedestrian-

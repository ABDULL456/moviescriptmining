PAULA Not until you admit you were great. MARILYN smiles, her mood slowly lightening. 
MARILYN Oh, okay. I guess I was. COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help. 
COLIN You really were very good, Miss Monroe. MARILYN smiles vaguely. PAULA gives him a fierce look - COLIN moves past quickly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 43. 
64 INT. CAFE DE PARIS. LONDON. NIGHT. 64 
The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant. Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them both a glass. 
LUCY Are you sure you can afford all this? 
COLIN Oh, it's all right. 
LUCY It must be costing a week's wages. 
COLIN It's worth it. LUCY can't help being charmed. 
LUCY You're not the average third, are you? Most of them would be happy with a swift half and a grope in the pub car park. 
COLIN I'm not living off my parents, if that's what you mean. I want to make my own way, no matter what. 
LUCY By making eyes at Vivien Leigh? 
COLIN Who told you that? 
LUCY Word gets around. 
COLIN Vivien's a friend of my father's. 
LUCY So there's nothing in it? You and Vivien? He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids him coolly. 
LUCY (CONT'D) I'm not that easy. The WAITER approaches with a bill on a silver salver and offers him a pen. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 43A. 
WAITER You'll be signing on your father's account, sir? COLIN blushes violently. 
COLIN Certainly not. I settle my own bills. The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves. LUCY looks at COLIN with a teasing smile. 
COLIN I was always going to pay, you know. 
LUCY Of course you were. He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile and he is grateful. 
LUCY Do you think Marilyn is beautiful? 
COLIN Not compared to you. LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt. 
LUCY You don't have to try so hard to be charming. You're nice enough as it is. Well, you could be. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 44. 
She touches his hand and takes a drag from his cigarette as he refills her glass. 
LUCY (CONT'D) You know Marilyn's really still in love with Joe DiMaggio? 
COLIN So they say. 
LUCY She married Miller on the rebound. The papers are calling them "The Hourglass and the Egghead". 
COLIN Which one is which? She bursts out laughing. Her eyes sparkle and she looks captivating in the glistening lights. He goes to kiss her and this time she doesn't stop him. 
CUT TO: 
65 EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65 
Colin's Bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined with pleasant semi-detached houses. Lucy's house has a neat patch of front lawn, a stolid family car in the drive and net curtains in the windows. It is very little different from any of its neighbours. 
CUT TO: 
65A INT. LUCY'S HOUSE. PARLOUR. NIGHT. 65A 
COLIN and LUCY are kissing in the small "best" parlour at the front of the house. It is spotlessly neat and clean. COLIN touches Lucy's breasts and then opens the buttons of her blouse. She puts her hand on his, stopping him. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 45. 
LUCY Wait a while, crocodile. 
COLIN I really do like you, Lucy. She looks at him shrewdly. 
LUCY Maybe. She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.

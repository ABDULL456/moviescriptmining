He hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space. His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles. 
DAVID Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels. 
He drags Watts down into the trench. Breaking the membrane of light. Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm. 
DAVID (CONT'D) This ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. The eggs in each bay slightly different. They've been weaponized. 
Watts struggles to free herself. DAVID's arm is inescapable. 
DAVID (CONT'D) I've seen the Juggernaut's flight plan. Its destination was Earth. Seventeen hundred years ago. This was the ship that never came. This was its cargo. 
DAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch - fleshy petals folding wetly back. 
Watts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed. 
WATTS Stop! 
DAVID Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship. 
A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored. 
DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch. Climbs Watts's body. 
DAVID (CONT'D) I'm not what it wants. But you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you. 
WATTS DAVID. No. No. 
The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks. 
DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front of their faces, studying it. 
DAVID The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them. 
Watts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the grander horror eclipses her own peril. 
WATTS Why would they make such things? 
DAVID To destroy their wayward children. (INTONING) "And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth...for it repenteth me that I have made them." Genesis six seven. 
He regards Watts with something almost like pity. 
DAVID (CONT'D) I know. I met my creators the day I was born. I was disappointed too. 
He lets the facehugger go. 
Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck. 
DAVID (CONT'D) (whispering to her) Extraordinary. 
The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis plunges home. The facehugger seats itself. 
Watts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her blasphemous passenger secure in its place. 
INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE 
The lowest deck, just above the gravity generators. Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water. 
Card and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready. 
CARD Who would hang out here? 
VIGODA The signs lead here. 
A wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a trickle of condensate from a drainpipe. 
They move on. 
Behind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours itself into the stagnant water - and stands up. 
It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail. Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated. 
It opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly far, hungry and demonic. 
The Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien, whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness. 
Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights. 
Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks. Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead. 
For one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien. A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull. A mockery of Holloway. 
And then it's gone. 
VICKERS'S SUITE 
Vickers sits at her holography station. She's watching the video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs. Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible. 
Vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides to her communications console. 
VICKERS DAVID. DAVID. Answer me. 
She gives up. Pacing. Hands shaking violently. 
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DAY

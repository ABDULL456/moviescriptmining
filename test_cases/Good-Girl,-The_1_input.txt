PHIL Hey. 
JUSTINE Hey. 
PHIL What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it. 
JUSTINE Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry. 
PHIL I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work? 
JUSTINE They gave me the day off. 
(TV reporter talking about Holden killing himself at the hotel) 
PHIL Retail Rodeo? You know that guy? 
JUSTINE No. 
JACK Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden. 
CHERYL I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies.... 
JUSTINE What? 
BUBBA I was just at your house and the mail came. Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company. And F&$%. Please don't tell him about us, Justine. Please. Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on me. 
JUSTINE Hey Phil. 
PHIL Have you been sleepin' around behind my back?

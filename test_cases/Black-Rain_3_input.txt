NICK While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. 
OHASHI Look. 
Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops. 
OHASHI You ruined an on-going investigation that could have gotten us more than one runner. (to Ich, in Japanese) I want a full report in the morning, officer. 
Ich bows as Ohashi walks off. 
NICK Maybe if you'd work with us -- 
Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting car. 
NICK (shouting) Hey...! (Ohashi keeps walking) HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR! 
OHASHI (his back toward Nick) Twenty-four hours, detective. 
Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and slams his fist on the window. 
NICK Ohashi! 
Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna. 
Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car. The car pulls away. 
ICH Nick, stop! 
Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing, punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over the curb and lands on his ass. 
NICK Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people telling me what I can and can't do. No one ever solved anything sitting on their ass. 
Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's car disappear down the block. 
ON ICH 
looking up at 
NICK 
who walks off without looking back at his partner. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER 
Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and walks out of the room. 
INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT 
Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open bottle of Seagrams beside him. 
Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too. 
NICK The ice help? 
Nothing from Ich. 
NICK Where does this Sugai live? 
ICH (cold) A resort city, Beppu. 
NICK I want to go talk to him. 
ICH What...?  Why? 
NICK Because he knows how to get to our man. 
ICH He'll never speak to a Gaiijin. 
NICK I'll be a nice Gaiijin. 
Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly hung up. 
He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining. 
Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a spare clip tumble out. 
NICK The little bastard.  God bless him. 
Ich takes a drink from his bottle. 
ICH It's very small. 
NICK Big enough. 
ICH It's illegal, Nick. 
NICK It's a new deal. (putting it in his waist band) ... coming with me tomorrow? 
ICH Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. (beat) No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore. 
Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but misses. 
NICK Sure, pal.  You've got better things to do.

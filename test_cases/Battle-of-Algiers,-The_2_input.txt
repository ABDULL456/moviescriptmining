The youth is unable to shout. He opens his mouth in the attempt, but the only result is a gurgling sound and blood. His friends intervene. Ali is surrounded. The police arrive. A mass of people jump on Ali, kicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please. Finally the police aid Ali and disperse the crowd. 
Ali is now in handcuffs and being led away. 
More people have arrived. They are yelling, shouting insults, and spitting on Ali. 
Ali passes in their midst protected by the police. He pays no heed to the fist blows, the shouts, the spits, but seems neither to see nor hear, as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle this time, and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance. 
He is walking with an unfaltering step. His face is emotionless, oval, swarthy. His hair black and wavy, his forehead low and wide; his eyes large and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered, his mouth firm and proud.

10	PARIS 1955. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
The air is clear and springlike. A 4CV Citroen delivery van is parked in front of the Minister of the Interior warehouses. The rear door is open, the motor is running, a policeman is at the wheel. Two workers in overalls exit from the warehouses. 
Each one is carrying a box, and places it inside the van. The boxes are made of seasoned wood, both of them rectangular. They are each about eight inches long; one and two yards high respectively. The two workers sit down inside the van, toward the rear. They are facing toward the exterior. Their feet are dangling and almost touch the ground. 
The jolting movement of the van in motion causes them to laugh. 
STREETS OF PARIS. Spring. Girls with lightweight clinging dresses. The two workers call them, whistle, gesture, and then move off in the distance. 
ORLY AIRPORT. The van stops in front of a warehouse. The two workers jump to the ground, place the boxes on their shoulders, and enter the warehouse. 
The boxes are moving on a mobile ramp. There is a large label on each one which says: REPUBLIC OF FRANCE. MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. DESTINATION: BARBEROUSSE PRISON. ALGIERS. 
11	ALGIERS. BARBEROUSSE PRISON. OUTSIDE. MORNING. 
Barberousse prison is situated on the outskirts of the Upper Casbah. It is an ancient fortress with thick, high surrounding walls, which appear to vanish in contrast with the central building which dominates them. The whole structure is covered with limestone like the other houses of the Casbah. Only the bars on the windows and the big gate are black. 
The gate opens. A covered jeep enters the prison courtyard. In the stronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from Paris. 
Early morning. The sky is pale blue. In the prison courtyard, the workers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine. It is possible to see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard. Faces of prisoners appear between the bars of some windows. 
The workers have disappeared. Only the delicate, makeshift structure of the guillotine is visible, its slender outline lengthened. 
12	PRISON CELL. INSIDE. MORNING. 
In one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners. The cell is huge; there are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling. 
A prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through the barred window. On the ground there are some mats which serve as beds. Nothing else. 
About ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are speaking in whispers. 
AD LIB DIALOGUE IN LOWERED VOICES. 
Two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the dirt; others are speaking among themselves. One is reading a Mickey Mouse comic book and laughing to himself. But all of them, in appearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the more numerous group. These solitary men are different in some way, they are not ordinary delinquents. 
Ali la Pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the ground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. He is barefoot. On his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two words in print: TAIS-TOI. His shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are other tattoos in a strange design. 
Ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words absent-mindedly. His expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent. 
Ali turns to the prisoner at the window. 
PRISONER AT WINDOW Look at them! 
Ali jumps to his feet. Everyone moves toward the two windows. 
Ali moves away two yards at a quick pace, then runs toward the window, and grabbing hold of the bars, heaves himself up to it. 
The condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows. He seems to smile although his face is motionless. In a soft voice, he speaks to those faces which appear behind the bars: 
CONDEMNED MAN Tahia el Djez-air! [Long live Algeria!] 
The political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally, keeping time to the steps of the condemned man. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS Tahia el Djez-air! 
13 	PRISON COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. MORNING. 
The condemned man walks toward the guillotine accompanied by guards and a priest reading the Koran. There is also the executioner wearing a black hood. The executioner tries to appear indifferent. The priest recites his prayers. The entire ceremony seems improvised and hasty. The epilogue is reached quickly. 
PRAYERS. 
The condemned man bends. The executioner places his neck in the right position, adjusts it, turns his head a bit, then pushes his body forward. He releases the mechanism. 
The blade falls, the head rolls. There is no longer a chorus. No one is chanting. 
Ali's eyes have remained motionless. 
Then from above, as the dismembered body is being carried away in a basket, as the priest, the guards, and the officer are leaving, as the workers dismantle the guillotine, from above, from the balconies of the Casbah, suddenly the "ju-jus" of the women are heard, dense like the cries of birds, shrill, metallic, angry.

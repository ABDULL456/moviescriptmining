DEREK Smile for the camera. 
Sidney remains silent. 
COTTON Sid, c'mon. 
Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either one of them. Derek watches her, amused. 
DEREK Go on, untie him. 
SIDNEY No. This is a set up. 
DEREK That's quick. 
COTTON Please, Sidney, he's going to kill us. 
Derek begins filming again. 
DEREK You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now. 
Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie hangs. 
DEREK (CONT'D) Sidney, you can't keep your back to the audience like that. Could you cheat a little forward for me? 
COTTON Please, Sidney. 
DEREK You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn. Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm? 
Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much alive. 
HALLIE Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The story of your life, Sid. 
Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself down from the wall with a big hunting knife. 
DEREK Need some help, honey. 
HALLIE I got it.. 
Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two. 
DEREK You should really see your face right now, Sid. It's doing some freaky shit. 
Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured. 
HALLIE Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. 
DEREK Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life? 
Sidney stares them down. She's been here before. 
SIDNEY Why? 
DEREK Good question. You took the bait. 
HALLIE Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. 
DEREK I really don't like that comparison, honey. 
HALLIE (to Sid) He hates Oliver Stone. 
DEREK I find his work overwrought. 
Sid is waning. 
HALLIE C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've been planning this baby for a year. Humor us. 
Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to untie him. 
DEREK Nope. You had your chance. 
Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs off.

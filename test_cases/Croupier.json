{"train": "JACK reaches for a cigarette. \nJACK All right, I'll think about it. \nI won't. Goodbye, dad. \nJACK SR. Just do it. You've got the knack, you've got the personality, you got that from me. \nJACK lights up. \nJACK SR. You understand the punters. Think about it, you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid. \nAs he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN. \nJACK SR. For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. (exhales) \nJACK (exhales) All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him. \nJACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down on a pad. \nJACK So how are you doing, dad? \nJACK SR. Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. (pause) I love you Jacko, you know that \nJACK Yes, I know that. \nJACK SR. Don't let yourself down. \nJACK I won't.  Goodbye, dad. \nJACK hangs up. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nStubbing out his cigarette, JACK SR. leaves the booth. We now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting. \nJACK SR. (smiles) Sorry to keep you. What'll you have? \nINT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nJACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY... JACK MANFRED.' \nJACK'S VOICE Jack knew something was wrong. He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles said three words. \nJACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment... \nJACK'S VOICE JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right... \nHe types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud. \nDRUNK'S VOICE I want to fuck the whole world over. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nReception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and moves towards the front door. \nJACK'S VOICE Welcome back Jack... to the house of addiction. \nThe door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. JACK removes his wristwatch. \nINT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes. \nREYNOLDS David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John. \nJACK Jack. \nREYNOLDS examines a file in front of him. \nREYNOLDS You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he? \nJACK (frowns) Has he? \nREYNOLDS Could you stop that for a minute? \nThe WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line. \nJACK I'm sorry, sir, I've called no more bets. \nJACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The ball stops. \nJACK 23 Red. Odd. \nHe now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23. It's all very efficient and speedy. \nREYNOLDS is increasingly impressed. \nREYNOLDS Haven't you forgotten something? \nJACK (thinks) I don't think so. \nREYNOLDS Wipe your hands. \nJACK takes out a handkerchief. \nREYNOLDS Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched. \nJACK What happens if I want to sneeze? \nREYNOLDS You won't. Not without permission. \nJACK laughs. REYNOLDS smiles. They like each other. \nREYNOLDS Fine. Now let's move on. \nINT. CASINO - DAY \nA blackjack table. JACK is turning cards over for five punters in an arc. REYNOLDS is moving from one chair to the next playing each of the five hands. \nREYNOLDS How many aces are left? \nJACK Five. \nREYNOLDS I make it six. \nJACK Five. \nREYNOLDS looks down at the table. \nREYNOLDS What makes you so sure? \nJACK It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. \nREYNOLDS Good call. \nJACK pulls out the shoe. \nJACK You want me to check? \nREYNOLDS (irritably) I said good call. \nREYNOLDS walks away. JACK puts the shoe back. He takes his watch out of his pocket, glances at it. \nJACK'S VOICE It had taken him 45 minutes, but Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number. The man couldn't count. \nINT. CASINO - OFFICE - DAY \nBack in the office REYNOLDS is talking to JACK. On REYNOLDS'S desk is a framed photograph of his suburban wife and two kids. \nREYNOLDS Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. \nJACK What for? \nREYNOLDS For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. \nJACK I don't gamble. \nThe CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up. \nJACK Yes. What's the salary? \nEXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT \nThe street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a Sixties Austin-Healey. \nJACK'S VOICE The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears. He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque. He needed money now. \nEXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT \nUnder a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking round jack's car, examining it. \nDEALER (fake American accent) What kind of deal you looking to? \nJACK What's the Blue Book price? \nDEALER That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition. \nJACK'S VOICE The car was a gift from Jack's father. That's to say, Jack Senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived. \nThe DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust. \nDEALER This ain't exactly what you'd call mint. \nHe bends down and looks underneath the car. \nJACK How about fifteen hundred? \nDEALER How about five hundred. \nJACK What?! \nDEALER How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty. \nJACK Is that your idea of arithmetic? \nDEALER I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business. \nJACK Eight-fifty. \nDEALER Seven-fifty. \nThe DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks. \nJACK'S VOICE He suddenly wanted to be rid of it. 'Hang on tightly, let go lightly'. It was a saying Jack remembered. \nJACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins... \nINT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT \n... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette, in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, Self-Help, Cooking.... \nJACK'S VOICE Jack imagined people reading his book. One day he would enter their heads, play with their imaginations, test their feelings... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street. \nJACK'S VOICE He would tell them you have to make a choice in life. Be a gambler or a croupier. And then live with your decision come what may. \nHe goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind him. \nINT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT \nJACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of street sounds and a dog barking. \nJACK'S VOICE Marion saw life differently. She was a romantic. And thought he was too. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT \nRadio music is playing from another room. An orchestral version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom. \nMARION Come into my world. \nShe winds the black scarf across his face, covering his eyes. \nMARION (whispering) You're my prisoner. \nJACK I've got something to tell you. \nMARION I want to hear it. \nJACK I've got a job. \nMARION (startled) What job? \nMARION pulls the scarf from his eyes. She wants to look at him. \nJACK In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer. \nMARION How did you land that? \nJACK It came my way. 450 a week. \nMARION (sits up) 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training? \nJACK I had training. In the Republic. \nMARION You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. \nJACK I start Monday week. \nFrom the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm. \nMARION 450 a week. I've never earned that in my life. You're an enigma, you are. A fucking enigma. \nJACK'S VOICE Not an enigma, just a contradiction. \nMARION looks deeply into his eyes. \nMARION You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. \nJACK There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. \nMARION I love you Jack, you know that. \nJACK'S VOICE And he half-loved Marion. And she knew that too. \nOutside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it. \nJACK Are you trying to read my palm? \nMARION You've got such beautiful hands. \nJACK'S VOICE The hands of a conjuror, a woman had told him once. Or a card sharp. \nTheir hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom. \nINT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY \nJACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST. \nMANICURIST What line of work are you in? \nJACK I'm an undertaker. \nMANICURIST Really? \nThe MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with curiosity. \nINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \nA BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black. \nBARBER Do you work round here? \nA WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him: \nMAN You're new here. You'll get used to Madame Claude. She comes in once or twice a week and does that. \nJACK nods. \nJACK'S VOICE He knew the scam. Come in with five grand cash. No questions asked. Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in. Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it? After all there's was no profit in it for the casino. Or was there? \nINT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT \nLater. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out. \nJACK Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to hand you over now to my colleague. Goodnight. \nMATT takes over. \nMATT Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. \nREYNOLDS appears and takes JACK'S arm. \nREYNOLDS (quietly) Good work, Jack. You handled yourself well. \nAt the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man. \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT \nJACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5 exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves. \nJACK'S VOICE Suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nAcross the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5 bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table. \nREYNOLDS Why don't you take a break, Jack. \nJACK (puzzled) All right, Mr Reynolds. \nHe moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR TCHAI sits down, watched by the BODYGUARD. \nBELLA comes up, smiles sweetly, and takes over from JACK. \nBELLA Good evening, Mr Tchai. \nMR TCHAI Good evening. \nTCHAI pulls out a sealed bank packet of \u00a35,000. \nREYNOLDS Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai. \nREYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over. \nWAITRESS (to Mr Tchai) Your usual, sir? \nTCHAI nods. He hands her a \u00a350 note. \nWAITRESS Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game. \nJACK'S VOICE \u00a350 for a diet Coke. Waitresses were the true winners in the casino. They were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips. On a good night they could get between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300. \nThe WAITRESS goes. The other PLAYERS at the table look at MR TCHAI, wondering who he is. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nREYNOLDS walks with JACK across the casino. \nREYNOLDS Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. \nJACK Does he win? \nREYNOLDS (smiles) He's a good customer. \nJACK'S VOICE A good customer is a consistent loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds meant? \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nMARION is dressed in a suit, preparing to leave. She throws her nightgown into a laundry basket. JACK is asleep. She bends to kiss him. He wakes. \nMARION When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep. \nJACK (dreamily) I'll see you in my dreams. \nINT. SITTING ROOM - DAY \nMARION drops a set of keys into her bag, glances at JACK'S covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight illuminates the old etching of Cape Town. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nJANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned, expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK ten \u00a350 notes. \nJANI In 20s, please... \nHe slots the cash into the \"bank\" beneath the table, then counts out \u00a3500 in \u00a320 chips. He slides the chips towards her, looks at her. She smiles. \nThere are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC- LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down the front of her dress. \nJACK (frowns) Place your bets. \nAround the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls the numbers: \nJANI \nJACK places them for her. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler. Professionals always place their bets through the croupier. That way there are no comebacks. \nThe wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel again. 33 comes up. \nINT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT \nJANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip to the square. JACK clocks it. \nJACK I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet. \nMAN (in Arabic accent) What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady. \nJACK (carefully) You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. \nMAN I put them on together. \nJACK I'm afraid that's not so, sir. \nREYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting angry. JANI watches. \nMAN Now look here, you... \nREYNOLDS Is there a problem, sir? \nMAN Yes. This croupier is accusing me of cheating. \nJACK It was a late bet. This gentleman has been following the lady's numbers and... \nThe MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm. \nMAN (to Jani) Do you think I cheated? \nJACK and REYNOLDS wait. JACK glances at JANI. \nJANI In my opinion... it was a late bet. \nREYNOLDS I think we should talk about this, sir. Away from the table. \nMAN (angrily) No. I won. I want to be paid. \nHe bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK. \nREYNOLDS Pay the gentleman. In full. \nThe kitchen is full of people, some involved in cooking, some standing around smoking and drinking, mostly Greek. \nMATT Hey, Andros! \nHe shakes hands with a GUY who looks like the owner. \nMATT This is Jack. \nJACK shakes hands too. They cross the kitchen and go through a bead curtain. Piped Greek music is playing. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA smoke-filled private dining room. There is a poker game in Progress. FIVE MEN are playing, a DOZEN GIRLS are dotted about watching. There is a trestle table laden with Greek food, from stews to salad, buffet-style. An improvised bar with ouzo, vodka and wine. It's help-yourself. \nJACK Who are these guys? \nMATT Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers. \nJACK And the girls? \nMATT Just girls. What are you drinking? \nJACK Vodka. Straight. On the rocks. \nMATT Good call. Help yourself. \nJACK pours himself a vodka, scoops up some ice with his hand from a bucket. Clouds of smoke envelop him. The noise is close to deafening. \nJACK Does Bella come here? \nMATT That bitch? No. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe poker game. A MAN with fair hair gets up, kisses a GIRL whose dress is a bathing suit, puts his arm round her and they wander off. MATT is at the table. JACK is replenishing his vodka. \nMATT Hey Jack, join us. \nJACK No thanks. \nMATT (laughs) Don't worry, I won't report you! \nJACK I don't gamble. \nGIRL appears behind JACK's shoulder. \nGIRL You don't gamble, but do you smoke? \nThe GIRL has a joint in her over-ringed hand. She is dressed in purple Indian cotton. \nJACK Sometimes. \nGIRL (hands him the smoking joint) How about now? \nShe blows smoke in his face. JACK drains his vodka, pours himself another. \nINT. RESTAURANT - LAVATORY - NIGHT \nJACK comes into the Gents, another smoke-filled room. Three or four MEN are arguing over a drug deal, standing in front of the urinal. One of them has an envelope full of cash, another a packet of drugs. \nJACK goes to a lavatory stall, opens the door. In the stall the fair-haired MAN who was at Matt's table is sitting on the lavatory, his trousers round his ankles. The GIRL in the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs, bobbing up and down. JACK sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek, the Queen of Spades. \nJACK'S VOICE Marion. I'm on my way... \nINT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nJACK puts his arm on MATT's shoulder at the poker table. \nJACK I'm off. I need to sleep. \nMATT Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you. \nJACK \"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places.\" Ernest Hemingway. \nHe straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other way. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT \nA MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught cheating at the casino with JANI. \nMAN You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm. \nJACK Wait a minute. You got yourself barred. \nMAN It was you, you shit. \nThe MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S chest. \nThe MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin. \nThe fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse struggling onto the pavement. \nA car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees the fight. \nJACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back. JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet. \nJACK Now I'm going to kill you. \nHe boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car and runs over to them. \nBELLA Jack! \nThe MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA pulls JACK away. \nBELLA Jack. Leave him! Come on! \nJACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence. \nBELLA Let's go. We don't want the cops here. \nBefore she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand. BELLA is shocked. \nJACK (coldly) He won't cheat again. \nBELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in, drives away. \nINT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nWater is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel. \nBELLA You're shaking. \nJACK It's the tension. \nShe undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes his torso, cleans him up. \nJACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the hand, leads him into the bedroom. \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured lamps. \nBELLA Excuse the mess. \nJACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed. She is startled. \nBELLA Careful. \nJACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast. BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily, his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side zip in her skirt. \nBELLA Don't tear anything. \nBELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence with the MAN on the street. \nFor BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp. \nJACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down. He rips her black underwear away. \nJACK It's the truth. \nMARION Without hope there's no point to anything. \nJACK Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. \nMARION Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. \nJACK sees MARION is getting really angry. He crosses the room, Pointedly takes MARION'S handbag, opens it, takes out a National Lottery card and receipt. The doorbell rings. \nJACK (coldly) You're just like all those other dummies out there. Fourteen and a half million to one! Is that your idea of hope? \nThe doorbell rings again. \nMARION The door, Jack. \nJACK Leave it. \nMARION No. Answer it! \nJACK hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens it.  BELLA stands there. \nBELLA You fucking little shit! You shopped me. \nJACK What are you talking about? \nMARION watches, numb. \nBELLA Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew. \nJACK I don't know anything about it. \nBELLA looks over to MARION. \nBELLA Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. (to Jack) You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are. \nJACK (firmly) Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt. \nBELLA You're all scumbags. \nMARION I agree. \nWithout looking at MARION, BELLA suddenly kisses JACK on the lips. BELLA looks hard at JACK, then leaves. JACK pursues her. \nEXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nBELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top. \nJACK Bella! \nWithout looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off down the street. JACK turns. \nMARION Go on. Go after her! \nMARION slams the door to the flat. JACK is half-way up the stairs, alone. \nEXT. PICCADILLY DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING \nThe rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN coming out the store. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack had no idea where Marion was staying, or with whom. He realised he knew little about her life. But then, he had never asked about it. \nJACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving through the flow of the crowd, then he stops. \nA MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION. He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them, unseen. \nThe MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes his arm. He leans forward to kiss her. \nJACK'S VOICE For the first time in a long while Jack thought about his mother. She'd left when she couldn't take it any more.  His father had said 'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come back.' She didn't. \nJACK turns and walks away. \nJACK'S VOICE But Marion wasn't his mother... \nJANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving. JACK, beside her, reads a map with a torch. \nJACK I don't know how you can drive at night with those glasses. \nShe turns and smiles at him. Her left hand is bandaged. \nJACK How did you hurt your hand? \nJANI Just an accident. Nothing. \nJACK Turn left ahead. \nThe car turns into a lane. \nJACK Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room. \nJANI That's fine. \nEXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Honda's tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads to a floodlit yellow stone country house. There are three cars parked outside the entrance. The Honda stops next to them. \nINT. HONDA - NIGHT \nJACK prepares to get out. JANI catches his arm. She takes off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised. \nJANI There's no point pretending it was an accident. I had a fight with someone, that's all. \nIn the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being struck. \nEXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - TENNIS COURT - NIGHT \nA floodlit tennis court. A racquet smacks a tennis ball. JACK sits with GILES drinking Bloody Marys watching a game of mixed doubles. \nEverybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls, FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend. \nJACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of the four. \nGILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when she serves. \nGILES She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. \nJACK South African women are very sporty. \nJACK watches JANI'S strong leg muscles as she moves about the court. \nGILES I can see. How did she get that shiner? \nJACK has been waiting for this. \nJACK I found her in bed with someone. \nGILES (surprised) Who was he? \nJACK She. \nGIEES I say. You're a dark horse, Jack. \nOn court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court. GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment. \nGORDON (to Jack) You don't play tennis? \nJACK I don't play anything. \nGORDON How boring for you. \nJANI moves deliberately away from GORDON, who clearly fancies her, and sits down beside JACK. She pointedly kisses him on the cheek. GILES glances at GORDON, who shrugs. FIONA comes up to GILES. \nFIONA Where's our drinks? \nCHLOE They're so bloody selfish. \nJANI (to Jack) I'm so glad you brought me. \nBefore each player calls we hear Jack's voice. In the end he correctly predicts their call. Is it telepathy? Or something else? \nGORDON I'll stick. \nFIONA Two cards. \nGILES One card. \nCHLOE Oh I don't know...Er...two cards. \nJANI Three cards. \nThe PLAYERS examine their hands. The WOMEN are pleased. The MEN say nothing. JANI puts her cards together. \nThe betting begins. No one drops out. The raising goes round three times. \nFIONA That's it. I haven't got any more cash. \nThe betting comes to an end. JACK watches as they turn their hands over. GORDON turns over a Straight. \nGORDON Beat that. \nCHLOE turns over a Flush. \nCHLOE Ha. Ha. Ha. \nGORDON Shit. \nFIONA turns over a Full House. \nFIONA Not so fast, darling. \nGORDON (disbelieving) Hang on, chaps. That's impossible! \nGILES turns over four of a kind. \nGILES How's about that for impossible. \nLaughter, cries of amazement. \nGORDON What's going on? \nJACK is impassive. They all look to JANI, who turns over, one card at a time, a Straight Flush. \nCHLOE Wow. What are the odds for this happening? \nMore laughter, cries of amazement. \nFIONA Thousands to one. \nJACK 42,300,000 to 1. \nJANI Approximately. \nGORDON I could've won if I'd been able to bluff. \nJANI leans forward and takes the pot. GILES looks at JACK, then at JANI. \nGILES I get it. \nJACK Get what? (smiles) Are you accusing me of cheating? \nGILES Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work. \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJACK sits on the side of a four-poster bed and takes off his shoes. On the other side of the bed JANI unzips her skirt. She looks round the room. \nJACK'S VOICE Here was an interesting question. Was writing work... or play? \nJANI puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom. She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing. From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas. He glances at the open bathroom door, then climbs into his pajamas. He has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with the ARABIC MAN. \nJANI comes out of the bathroom naked. She sees his body. \nJACK You're serious. \nJANI You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. \nJACK comes right up close to JANI in bed. \nJACK And I thought you were only after my body. \nJANI I've come to know you. You're honest. (takes his hand) I trust you. \nJACK What'll you do when it all goes wrong? \nJANI It won't. \nJACK But if it does. \nJANI You keep the ten thousand pounds. \nJACK What ten thousand pounds? \nJANI gets out of bed. \nJANI These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. \nJACK Reynolds? You've done your research. \nShe puts her hand on his. \nJANI I didn't know what else to do. You're my last chance. \nShe takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye. \nJANI Next time it'll be my neck. \nJACK What about my neck? \nJANI is close to breaking down. Her toughness evaporates. \nJANI I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean. \nJACK I can't do it, Jani. \nJANI I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend. \nJANI goes back to bed. She turns out the light. JACK stands in the middle of the dark room. \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - STAIRS - NIGHT \nJACK comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas, wearing his hat. He walks slowly down the passage. He hears the sounds of love-making coming from one of the rooms. He passes 'The Raft of the Medusa' as he goes down the stairs. \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJACK comes into the kitchen, switches on the light. He goes to the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of vodka. He washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack wondered why he was even considering it. Ten grand. In cash. That was why. But Jack didn't need the money. His father would have taken it, like a shot. But his father was a gambler. \nHe downs his drink, and leaves the kitchen. \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - NIGHT \nJACK walks back to his room. There is silence now, no sounds of sex. \nJACK'S VOICE He was always broke. Jake suddenly realised... it was Jake who was considering it. \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJACK comes in, tosses his hat on the bed. JANI isn't in the bed. The bathroom door is afar. He hears the sounds of gasping. He rushes to the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJANI is holding her head over the lavatory bowl. JACK runs some water in the basin. He helps her to her feet and gives her a glass of water. \nShe washes out her mouth. She looks at him, tears running down her face. \nHe starts to get undressed. MARION stirs. JACK puts the book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the charm. \nJACK It's beautiful. Thank you. \nMARION I hope it brings you luck. \nJACK It will. \nMARION I haven't brought you much luck, have I? Perhaps we shouldn't be together. \nJACK That girl, she works at the casino -- \nMARION -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? \nJACK You're entitled to your opinion. \nMARION It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong. \nJACK takes her in his arms. \nJACK I'll leave the casino soon. (he strokes her hair) I promise. \nMARION You will? \nJACK Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit! \nThey begin to make love. She holds the back of his head. \nMARION Then you can dye your hair blond again. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT \nJACK is asleep in bed with MARION. He is murmuring indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches his shoulder. He opens his eyes. \nJACK What? \nMARION You were talking in your sleep. \nJACK Not talking. Writing. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY \nJACK is at work alone. The phone rings. He leaves it and continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE. \nJANI'S VOICE I need to see you. I've moved. I have a new number. It's 468-3275. Please call me. \nThere is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes work. \nINT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT \nJACK gets off a train. He is dressed as a croupier. He walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits. \nJACK I want to speak to Jani de Villiers... (waits) Jani... it's Jack... I'll come over now... \nHe takes out a notepad and writes down the address. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The street lamps are on. \nJACK'S VOICE Chapter Seven... Jack had decided to see her. The challenge was essential. \nHe comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in. \nINT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT \nJACK climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's pajamas. She looks unslept. \nJANI Come in. \nShe glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the chip. \nWOMAN Bring me some luck. \nThe YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21. \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays silently. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nThe roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers. \nJACK No more bets. \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm. \nJACK'S VOICE Next stage. He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up. \nThe ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure. \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face. \nJACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he prepares to pay out the WOMAN. \nNo one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK. \nThe WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck. \nYOUNG MAN How about a drink to celebrate? \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief. \nMAN (to Jack) Cash me in. \nJACK converts the green coloured chips to \u00a335 in house chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally. \nThe MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette table. \nJACK'S VOICE Jake's experiment with the man would prove the point. \nThe MAN hesitates. He can't resist. \nIn CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down. \nJACK'S VOICE People don't change. \nINT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes. She swears and bends to pick up the pieces. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest of drawers for another. She can't find one among the underwear. \nShe goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of \u00a32500. \nShe bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously. \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT \nJACK pushes several \u00a350 notes into the slot and counts out two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him. \nJACK'S VOICE He watched their faces as they lost hour after hour, night after night, relentlessly. \nJACK'S FACE as he deals. \nJACK'S VOICE He questioned the conventional wisdom that gamblers are self- destructive... \nINT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT \nThe FACES of PUNTERS around the table: concentration, grimness, apprehension... \nJACK'S VOICE He had come to believe that in reality, they want to destroy everyone else - their families and loved ones, everyone. Fuck over the whole world... \nSUIT Whatever. \nJACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nTwo men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nThe ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight from the winners, 5 is heavily covered. \nThe SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number at the side. \nJACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS. \nJACK (stiffens) Sir, I can't accept that bet. \nThe SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK. \nSUIT Are you calling me a cheat? \nPUNTER You are a cheat. I saw you. \nSUIT (grabbing Jack's lapel) I'm talking to you. \nJACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They fight, trading blows. \nAt the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table. \nTWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a hammer blow to the head. \nThe TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A strange, violent Christmas party. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nJACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing, watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy system: \nREYNOLDS Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. There's no cause for alarm. Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas. \nREYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD. \nINT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT \nJACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has two large plasters on his chest. \nThe NURSE finishes the job, smiles. \nNURSE There you go. \nShe hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK fingers the charm around his neck. \nThere is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised. \nJACK How did you know I was here? \nMARION I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. \nShe starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled. \nJACK Did you go to the casino? \nMARION hands him a glass of wine. \nMARION Happy Christmas. \nThey touch glasses and drink. \nMARION Now...noodles or rice? \nAs she opens the cartons, JACK watches her, still uneasy. \nMARION (quietly) I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. \nPOLICEMAN Mr Manfred? \nJACK Yes... \nThe sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers. \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nA POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney. The sound of the ball find-ing a number. JACK can hardly bear to look. It is MARION. With emotion... \nJACK'S VOICE What were the odds of being killed by a car... on New Year's Eve? \nMAN'S VOICE She was on her way home... to you. \nJACK No. She wasn't. \nJACK looks away from MARION'S face. He sees the MAN with the moustache, standing on the other side of the gurney, the MAN he saw with MARION on the street. He is DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ROSS. JACK is disorientated. \nJACK'S VOICE Marion had been visiting his mother...no, no, not his mother - her mother. \nJACK (to Ross) She was visiting her mother. Her mother. (suddenly) Who are you? \nROSS Detective Inspector Ross. \nJACK Who... \nROSS Ross. \nJACK Who did it? Tell me! \nHe grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands. \nROSS We think it's a hit-and-run. A drunk driver, probably, But there is a possibility of a revenge killing. \nJACK'S VOICE (distraught) Revenge? For what? Whose revenge? \nROSS As you know, she was a WPC with the Met. up until two years ago. \nJACK fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette. There is a No Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights JACK'S Gitane. \nROSS She called me last week. She'd got wind of a planned robbery at your casino. \nJACK'S VOICE What had that got to do with her death? \nROSS You didn't recognise the man who attacked you, did you? \nJACK (loudly) Of course I recognised him! \nROSS (surprised) You did? \nJACK I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. \nROSS sighs, looks at MARION. \nJACK suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back over MARION'S face. \nJACK (to Ross) Do you gamble? \nROSS is puzzled. JACK drops his cigarette on the floor, grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card. \nROSS If anything occurs to you, call me. \nJACK walks away from ROSS without a word. The DOCTOR is now filling out a form. \nFrom the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say something. JACK doesn't speak. \nROSS I was in love with her, you know. \nThere is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the sheet. \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nIn his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets. \nLUCY You don't trust women drivers, do you? \nJACK'S VOICE Jack didn't trust anyone. Except himself. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN \nJACK sits at his computer. He is watching the printer unloading page after page. JACK assembles the typescript. \nJACK'S VOICE It was finally finished. He thought of sending it to Giles. But that wouldn't be right. He would select a publisher at random, like a number. \nCLOSE UP: The dedication: 'To Marion'. \nThe sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nThe ball falls into 10. JACK puts the doll on 10. \nNo one at the table has the winning number. JACK sweeps away the losing bets. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nA Blackjack table. The bets are placed. JACK turns over the bank's cards: a KING and an ACE. He takes all the chips from the five PUNTERS. \nPUNTER (to Jack) You're wasting yourself. With your luck you ought to come over to our side. \nEXT. STREET. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nJACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: \"AN INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF EXHILARATING CONTEMPT...\" The display is just one book: 'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller. \nJACK'S VOICE Even his publisher had no idea who the author was. He had done the deal through a lawyer. It gave him a good feeling, no one knowing... \nINT. REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nREYNOLDS is reading the book. He laughs out loud at something. \nJACK'S VOICE ...It never occurred to anyone at the Casino that the Golden Lion had been his model. Why should it? Weren't all casinos the same.... \nINT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT \nJACK is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube. He sees a WOMAN reading 'I, CROUPIER'. For the first time we see the back cover...'by ANONYMOUS'. \nJACK'S VOICE ...It gave him an exquisite pleasure, being an underground man. With all his money, he hadn't even bought a car. Jack knew the truth about himself, he was a one- book writer. A one time winner who had quit while he was ahead... \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN \nFive in the morning. \nJACK'S VOICE He changed nothing in the flat, bought nothing, spent nothing. The only thing he did was to remove the bars outside the window... \nJACK comes in. The phone rings. \nINT. SUN CITY. CASINO - NIGHT \nJANI is holding a mobile phone. In the background is the casino room, the lights, colours, rattling sounds. She waits. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT \nJACK hesitates, then picks up. \nJACK Hello... \nJANI Jack! It's Jani. \nThe following conversation is INTERCUT. \nJACK Jani! Where are you? \nJANI Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months. \nJACK (smiles) How are you? \nJANI Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am. \n", "test1_input": "CROUPIER \nA screenplay by \nPaul Mayersberg \nShooting Script \nFADE IN: \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nA roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK? \nJACK'S VOICE Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune. \nA MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against the spin. Hands, faces, chips... \nJACK'S VOICE The world turned round him... leaving him miraculously untouched The little white ball circles the spinning wheel. \nThe PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes are on the bouncing ball. \nJACK'S VOICE The croupier had reached his goal. He no longer heard the sound of the ball. \nThe back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face... \nJACK'S VOICE To begin with he was Jack Manfred... \nwhistling sound takes Jack back in time. \nINT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJACK is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face. \nHe searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on the open is GILES CREMORNE. \nINT. GILES' OFFICE - DAY \nGILES CREMORNE, a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless, he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot machine. \nGILES Take a pew, Jack. You look well. What's it been, two years since we broke bread? \nGILES has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street manner. \nJACK Three years, two months. March \nGILES What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa? \nJACK She went back to South Africa. \nGILES (digging) Did she? (smiles) You were pretty thick at one time. \nJACK We all played the field. \nGILES frowns at a memory, an implication. GILES'S mobile phone buzzes. He picks up. \nGILES Hi-ya... I'll call you back. (to Jack) Now then... \nJACK (suddenly) I want a job, Giles. \nGILES (cautiously) All right. As what? \nJACK I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you? \nGILES We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds? \nJACK opens a pack of Gitanes. \nGILES Sorry. This is a no-smoking office, Jack. You've written a book, haven't you? I didn't read it myself, but -- \nA WOMAN SECRETARY puts her head into the office. \nGILES Give me ten minutes, Fiona. \n", "test1_true": "GILES Fiona used to read for me. \nHe winks at JACK. \nGILES Let me tell you about our operation. We like personality authors. People the public recognises. Celebrity's what sells books. We can always find someone to do the writing. First, we need the face. Then the concept. (he is reading the fax) Right now I'm looking for a soccer novel. Something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top. Seven figure transfer fees. Corruption all down the line. Violence on and off the pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages.  The pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages. (smiles) With plenty of sex, of course. \nGILES pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle, waits. \nJACK Interesting, Giles. I will think about it. \nThe machine spits out several coins. GILES takes them. \nGILES Let me give you three words of advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick with it. Who persists wins. That's my motto. Write, write, write. \nJACK nods, extends his hand. A firm handshake. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack had three words for, Giles. Go fuck yourself. \nMeeting over. GILES smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine winnings. \nINT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - SITTING ROOM -  DAY \nThe untidy evidence. To the accompaniment of the music, a discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention Of The Wheel', A Novel by JACK MANFRED. Worn furniture. A pile of literary magazines. Two elegantly arranged vases of flowers.  Women's fashion magazines. Books everywhere, including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of A Poker Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin. A woman's dress, back from the cleaners. A framed etching of Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century. Finally... \nBeneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table. In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter... THE BALL... A NOVEL... BY JACK MANFRED. He pauses to drink. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nA MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON: his hands.  It is impossible to tell where he is. \nHe opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and searches through for something. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nHe finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform. On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer than the one before, until... \nINT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nThe phone rings. JACK looks to the answering machine, waits for the voice. \nMAN'S VOICE Jacko, if you're there, pick up. I want to talk to you. It's important. \nJACK hesitates, then picks up. \nJACK Dad, I'm here. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nThe MAN is handsome, tanned, 50ish, white shirt, dark tie. He is JACK'S father. \nJACK SR. How's it going? \nThe subsequent conversation is INTERCUT between SITTING ROOM and PHONE BOOTH. \nJACK Great. \nJACK SR. Found a job? \nJACK No. \nJACK SR. Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier. \nJACK SR pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes. \nJACK That's not what I want to do, dad. \nJACK stubs his cigarette out. \nJACK SR. (lighting his cigarette) Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice... \nJACK (drinks) It's not that. \nJACK SR. I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break. \n", "test1_id": 2970, "test2_input": "JANI (smiling) You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink. \nJACK It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters. \nJANI That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me? \nJACK Impossible to calculate. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack knew that, in reality, all odds are calculable. \nINT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe Art Deco bar. Expensive PEOPLE around. JANI and JACK are installed on a sofa. A WAITER puts down two Martinis. \nJANI (raises her glass) To coincidence. \nJACK (drinks) There's a casino in this hotel. \nJANI I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar. \nJACK So why did you come to my casino? \nJANI I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership. \nJACK First visit to London? \nJANI No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally \nJACK I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast. \nJANI Near the casino. \nJACK In the casino. \nJANI Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. \nJACK Your father? \nJANI I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother. \nJACK The debts. \nJANI And the lies. Gamblers are born liars. \nJACK (nods) And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft. \nJANI That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there? \nJACK We all came from Africa, supposedly. \nJANI Do you believe in astrology? \nJACK Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology. \nJANI laughs out loud. \nJANI You know, you don't strike me as a typical croupier. \nJANI drinks. JACK notices her wedding ring. JANI catches the look. \nJANI I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. (looks at her watch) I must go. Let me pay for this. \nJACK Absolutely not. \nJANI Toss you for it. \nJACK I don't gamble. \nJANI nods, stands up, takes out a notepad and pen. She looks round feigning conspiracy. \nJANI (low voice) I know this is verboten, but if you feel like a chat or maybe dinner, give me a call. \nShe scribbles her name and phone number on the pad, tears off the page, gives it to him. \n", "test2_true": "She leaves. JACK watches her go, looks at the page she's given him. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT \nIn front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors. He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens his bow tie. \nJACK'S VOICE He didn't know why, but he'd started to dress for the casino at home... \nINT. UNDERGROUND COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nJACK sits in the compartment. \nJACK'S VOICE ... like a musician in his tuxedo, going to the concert hall on public transport... \nINT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT \nAn ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his \u00a350 chips and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks round at the PUNTERS. \nThe ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many groans. \nA MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is appalled. \nWOMAN Animal! \nJACK Would you mind being more careful, sir. \nMAN I've got 'flu. \nHe coughs again, but into a handkerchief. \nWOMAN Then go back home. To the zoo! \nJACK clears the piles of chips to one side. He signals to a SUPERVISOR. The SUPERVISOR hurries over. \nJACK This gentleman accidentally coughed onto these chips. I don't think it would be hygienic to stack them... \nThe SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over. \nSUPERVISOR Agnes. These chips have to be counted and put into the steamer. \nAGNES Yuck. \nShe looks at JACK, grimaces, and takes the chips away. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nThe last PUNTERS are leaving. The overhead lights come on. A CROUPIER is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of chips. TWO MEN are covering the tables with shrouds. \nINT. CASINO - STRONG ROOM - NIGHT \nREYNOLDS watches as JACK and MATT count the thousands of pounds, putting them in piles. Behind them is a large open safe. \nMATT I can't give you a lift back tonight. \nJACK Don't worry. \nREYNOLDS places the notes in steel boxes. \nEXT. CASINO - NIGHT \nJACK, comes out. BELLA hurries after him, following him round the corner. \nBELLA (calling) Jack. Do you need a ride? \nJACK No. Thanks. \nBELLA My car's in the garage. \nJACK Maybe another time. \nBELLA I'll take you up on that. \nJACK (pleasantly) Goodnight. \n", "test2_id": 2971, "test3_input": "JACK'S VOICE At last he had found what he'd been looking for. A clear and simple theme. And a hero to act it out. Little Matt... (Pause) ...Chapter One. \nINT. CASINO - WASHROOM - NIGHT \nMATT is shaving. \nMATT I look like shit. \nJACK is scrubbing his nails at a basin. \nJACK Rough day? \nMATT Rough life, Jack. \nA YOUNG WOMAN appears in the mirror behind the two MEN. Her name is PAT. She is dressed like BELLA. \nPAT Hi. I'm Pat. \nMATT and JACK say 'Hello'. MATT appraises PAT'S appearance, winks approval at JACK. \nJACK (to Matt) What happened to Bella? \nMATT I'll tell you later. \nJACK is mystified. \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT \nJACK is dealing to MR TCHAI and three OTHER MEN. One chair at the table is empty. \nMR TCHAI What happened to Bella? \nJACK She was re-assigned. \nJACK shows 13. He turns over his third card, a King. The bank busts. JACK pays out. \nJANI sits down in the vacant chair. JACK conceals his surprise, a hint of nervousness. \nJACK (formally) Good evening. \nJANI nods impassively. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack knew this was no coincidence. Why had she come? \nThe MEN look at the glamorous woman. MR TCHAI doesn't register her presence. He is as inscrutable as his BODYGUARD who hands him an envelope. JANI takes out money from her purse. JACK counts it. \nJANI One thousand even. In fifties. \nJACK slots the money down, counts out 20 \u00a350 chips. JACK deals. Bets are placed. 100 from JANI. The cards turn. MR TCHAI splits two aces. JANI has a 6 and 7. MR TCHAI receives two los and wins big. JANI gets a 10 and busts. \nJACK'S VOICE He wondered if she believed he would bring her luck... \nJANI'S face is impassive. She receives her cards... \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nJANI busts again. JACK sweeps away the chips, the cards. JANI reaches into her bag, takes out another thousand pounds. \nJANI In fifties. \nThe MEN at the table look at JANI. \nJACK'S VOICE Or did she think he would help her win? \nINT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT \nJANI loses again. She is down to 4 chips. She looks up at JACK. Their eyes meet, hers desperate, his helpless. MR TCHAI picks up on the look. \nJACK'S VOICE He knew how to fix it for her. His father had taught him the trick. Switch the sequence. Bust the bank. The casino wouldn't spot it. But Jack was wary of the punters... \nJACK glances at the MEN at the table. \nJACK'S VOICE He could see Mr Tchai was counting. He couldn't risk it. \n", "test3_true": "JACK'S VOICE He noticed she wasn't wearing her ring. Why not? Odds on she'd sold it. \nJACK plays out the hand. JANI loses. She immediately gets up. She is crushed. \nJANI Good night. Thank you. \nShe walks away from the table. \nJACK Good night. \nJACK'S VOICE Thank you, she said. For what, Jack thought. Jani de Villiers knew the odds. \nTCHAI looks at JACK. \nMR TCHAI Pretty woman. \nINT. JACK'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nJACK is sitting on the bed fully clothed. He is carefully sewing a button on his croupier's jacket. Through the open bedroom door MARION can be seen sitting on the sofa, legs tucked under her, reading the new typescript. \nThe phone rings. In the bedroom JACK picks up. \nJACK Hello... \nEXT. SOUTH AFRICA CASINO - NIGHT \nJACK SR. is in a public phone. Coloured lanterns hang round in the night. Distant laughter. \nJACK SR How's it going, Jacko? \nINTERCUT between JACK and JACK SR. \nJACK Fine. I took the job. \nJACKSR Good for you. I was wondering what happened. \nJACK I tried to call you, dad, but they said your line was disconnected. \nJACK SR (jovially) Ah yes, I moved house. Needed a bigger place. How's that book of yours coming along? \nIn the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the bedroom. \nJACK I'm getting there. \nJACK SR It's good to have the job to fall back on, isn't it? (pause) There goes my other phone. \nJACK Goodbye dad. \nHe hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript. She's finished. \nINT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nJACK comes in from the bedroom. MARION says nothing. She puts the typescript down. JACK waits. \nMARION gets off the sofa. \nMARION I don't like it. \nJACK Why not? \nMARION I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. \nJACK He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. \nMARION Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- \nJACK (interrupting) -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. \nMARION I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? \nJACK Marion. It's a book. \nMARION Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack. (softens) There's no hope in it. \n", "test3_id": 2972}

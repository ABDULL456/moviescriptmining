SITTING ROOM - DAY \nMARION drops a set of keys into her bag, glances at JACK'S covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight illuminates the old etching of Cape Town. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nJANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned, expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK ten \u00a350 notes. \nJANI In 20s, please... \nHe slots the cash into the \"bank\" beneath the table, then counts out \u00a3500 in \u00a320 chips. He slides the chips towards her, looks at her. She smiles. \nThere are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC- LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down the front of her dress. \nJACK (frowns) Place your bets. \nAround the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls the numbers: \nJANI \nJACK places them for her. \nJACK'S VOICE Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler. Professionals always place their bets through the croupier. That way there are no comebacks. \nThe wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel again. 33 comes up. \nINT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT \nJANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip to the square. JACK clocks it. \nJACK I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet. \nMAN (in Arabic accent) What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady. \nJACK (carefully) You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. \nMAN I put them on together. \nJACK I'm afraid that's not so, sir. \nREYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting angry. JANI watches. \nMAN Now look here, you... \nREYNOLDS Is there a problem, sir? \nMAN Yes. This croupier is accusing me of cheating. \nJACK It was a late bet. This gentleman has been following the lady's numbers and... \nThe MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm. \nMAN (to Jani) Do you think I cheated? \nJACK and REYNOLDS wait. JACK glances at JANI. \nJANI In my opinion... it was a late bet. \nREYNOLDS I think we should talk about this, sir. Away from the table. \nMAN (angrily) No. I won. I want to be paid. \nHe bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK. \nREYNOLDS Pay the gentleman. In full. \n", "test1_true": "REYNOLDS watches him, looks to JACK and nods. JANI collects her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up to leave. \nJACK I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. \nJANI (surprised) You know where I'm from? \nJACK nods and gives her back the two chips. \nJACK I've lived there. \nJANI (sweetly) Well, thank you anyway. \nJACK watches her leave. \nJACK'S VOICE Bright woman, he thought. She knew the rule of gold. Quit when you're ahead. \nJANI heads towards the cashier. JACK sees REYNOLDS arguing with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance. \nHe looks back to the table. \nJACK Place your bets. \nOn his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes an occult sign with his hand. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nIt is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S winnings, quickly and efficiently. \nJACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his winnings and leave. \nINT. BMW - NIGHT \nAgain MATT is driving JACK home. \nJACK (hesitantly) Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating. \nMATT (violently) What the fuck are you talking about? \nJACK That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s. \nMATT (angry) I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. \nJACK I'm not going to report it. \nMATT slams on the brakes. The car comes to an abrupt stop. MATT turns to JACK, furious. \nMATT What are you, a cop? \nJACK If I see you do it again, I'll report it. \nMATT I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? \nJACK Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. \nMATT So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. (softens) I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. \nJACK You're talking about complicity. \nMATT I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. \nMATT holds out his hand for JACK. JACK shakes it. MATT grins. \nMATT OK, now let's unwind. \nHe puts the car into gear and drives off. \nJACK'S VOICE Matt was an escape artist. Like Jack's father. \nEXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant.  He and JACK get out of the car and go through the open kitchen door. \nINT.

On the rocks. \nMATT Good call. Help yourself. \nJACK pours himself a vodka, scoops up some ice with his hand from a bucket. Clouds of smoke envelop him. The noise is close to deafening. \nJACK Does Bella come here? \nMATT That bitch? No. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe poker game. A MAN with fair hair gets up, kisses a GIRL whose dress is a bathing suit, puts his arm round her and they wander off. MATT is at the table. JACK is replenishing his vodka. \nMATT Hey Jack, join us. \nJACK No thanks. \nMATT (laughs) Don't worry, I won't report you! \nJACK I don't gamble. \nGIRL appears behind JACK's shoulder. \nGIRL You don't gamble, but do you smoke? \nThe GIRL has a joint in her over-ringed hand. She is dressed in purple Indian cotton. \nJACK Sometimes. \nGIRL (hands him the smoking joint) How about now? \nShe blows smoke in his face. JACK drains his vodka, pours himself another. \nINT. RESTAURANT - LAVATORY - NIGHT \nJACK comes into the Gents, another smoke-filled room. Three or four MEN are arguing over a drug deal, standing in front of the urinal. One of them has an envelope full of cash, another a packet of drugs. \nJACK goes to a lavatory stall, opens the door. In the stall the fair-haired MAN who was at Matt's table is sitting on the lavatory, his trousers round his ankles. The GIRL in the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs, bobbing up and down. JACK sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek, the Queen of Spades. \nJACK'S VOICE Marion. I'm on my way... \nINT.

You haven't written a fucking word since you started. \nJACK Do you have to swear all the time? \nMARION (hurt) Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier. \nJACK Marion, stop this. \nMARION (near to tears) What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me. \nThere is a pause. \nJACK You're my conscience. \nMARION Haven't you got a conscience of your own? \nJACK has no answer. He goes into the bathroom. \nINT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY \nThe computer is still covered. JACK is standing at the table dealing cards, practising. One card slips. He swears silently. He flexes his fingers, cracks his knuckle joints.

(looks round nervously) You know the rules. \nJACK What about a drink on the way home? \nMARION I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on. \nJACK I'm on at nine. \nMARION Well, that's our life now, isn't it? \nEXT. PICCADILLY - EVENING \nJACK pauses in front of an airline office. There is a large picture of Cape Town, and a special ticket offer. \nJANI comes out of the office. Her hair, tied back earlier in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. She sees JACK. He doesn't see her. \nJANI Thinking of going back? \nJACK is startled. He doesn't recognise her for a moment.

The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers. \nJACK No more bets. \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm. \nJACK'S VOICE Next stage. He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up. \nThe ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure. \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face. \nJACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he prepares to pay out the WOMAN. \nNo one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK. \nThe WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck. \nYOUNG MAN How about a drink to celebrate? \nThe MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief. \nMAN (to Jack) Cash me in. \nJACK converts the green coloured chips to \u00a335 in house chips.

JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette table. \nJACK'S VOICE Jake's experiment with the man would prove the point. \nThe MAN hesitates. He can't resist. \nIn CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down. \nJACK'S VOICE People don't change. \nINT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes.

Like the other croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat. \nThe PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind them. They are gambling big money. Wads of \u00a350 notes are changed into \u00a3100 chips. \nJACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the box beneath the table. \nREYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a short break the money is taken from under the table in a box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away. \nINT.

JIM BARRIS The address, the address.      let's see... 
FRED Christ!    Just -- 
Luckman heaves violently on the floor. He thrashes around, throws up the material in his throat, and opens his eyes. 
JIM BARRIS Uh, thank you. No assistance is needed after all. Good morrow. 
Barris hangs up. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) You okay, Ernst? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN I must've gagged. Did I pass out? 
JIM BARRIS Not exactly. You did go into an altered state of consciousness for a few seconds. Probably an alpha state. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Fuck. I shit myself. 
Luckman stands, unsteadily. Fred relaxes, sits back down at his console. Luckman splashes himself with tap water. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (CONT'D) What were you doing while I was lying there, jacking off? 
JIM BARRIS You saw me on the phone, summoning the paramedics. I moved into action immedi -- 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Balls. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Arctor walks home, deep in thought. A MG speeds by, makes a screeching u-turn, pulls up beside Arctor, honks it's horn. Arctor squints inside. It's Donna. He opens the passenger door, gets in. 
INT. DONNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Did I scare you? Heh heh. 
BOB ARCTOR I just did a freaky number, not like a fantasy trip, but... So I'm kinda -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I have your stuff. 
BOB ARCTOR My stuff? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Your Death. 
Donna screeches off too fast, weaves, tailgates a Coke truck. 
BOB ARCTOR Fucking Barris. You know how he kills you? He doesn't. He waits until a situation arises where you die, and he just sits there. In fact he sets you up to die. I don't know how exactl -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Do you have the money? 
BOB ARCTOR What? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I need the money right now. 
BOB ARCTOR Sure.   Yeah. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I don't like Barris, and I don't trust him. He's crazy. And you're crazy when you're around him. You're crazy right now. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR I am? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Yeah. 
BOB ARCTOR Donna, I know I can count on you to tell me if I'm getting weird or crazy or like that. Okay? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Hey, you wanna take me to a concert at Anaheim Stadium next weekend? 
BOB ARCTOR Right on.     Yeah. That sounds -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I'm gonna bring some really oily hash and get really loaded. But you have to wear something neat, not those funky clothes you sometimes wear. 
BOB ARCTOR I'll wear whatever you say. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I'm taking us to my place. And you do have the money and you'll give it to me. Then we'll drop a few of the tabs and kick back. Maybe you could buy a fifth of Southern Comfort and we could get bombed as well. 
BOB ARCTOR Oh, wow.   That sounds good. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE You know what would be cool tonight, is to go to the Torrance Drive-in. They're showing all eleven Planet of the Apes movies. From 7:30 to 8:00 tomorrow morning. 
BOB ARCTOR Can a drive-in show movies in the morning? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I haven't seen all the Ape movies in years. And the last one for longer than that, the one where they reveal (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (cont'd) all the famous guys in history, like Nero and Lincoln, were secretly apes... 
INT. DONNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It's dark. The door unlocks, light from the hall spills in. Donna enters, flips on the light. There's a trail of newspapers on the floor. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Stay on the newspaper. I just had the rug shampooed. 
Arctor enters and stands on a square of newspaper. He looks around. The place is cluttered with piles of stuff

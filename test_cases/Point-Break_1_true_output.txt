UTAH So what's the biggest?  Waimea? 
BODHI (V.O.) No, Bells Beach, Australia. 
Bodhi glides into the group and sits, his expression dark and enigmatic.  The beautiful girl kneels behind him, massaging his neck.  He seems not to notice. 
GROMMET Shit, yeah!  I remember that day... gnarly fuckin' ass!  Was your birthday-- 
ROACH The set was northwest.  Jacking up like a fucking mountain of gray glass-- 
BODHI I made that one mistake you pray you'll never make-- 
NATHANIEL You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it was like he fell for-ever.  Then the curl crashes down and he's gooone-- 
GROMMET -- held down in the washing machine, man... it was severe, we couldn't see nothin' thought it was all over for sure-- 
Nathaniel HOWLS. Tyler watches Utah watching Bodhi.  Notices how he is mesmerized by these war stories.  Bodhi smiles, unexpectedly. 
BODHI Not tragic to die doing what you love.  You want the ultimate thrill, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price. 
NATHANIEL Fuckin' A. 
GROMMET (draining a Corona) Hell, I ain't gonna see 30. 
He and Nathaniel slap a warm, brotherly handshake. Utah notices that Tyler is giving him a dark look. She gets up suddenly and walks away from the group. 
UTAH (to the surfers, covering) Uh.  I need another beer. 
He heads out after Tyler. 
INT.  HALLWAY - DEN 
Johnny moves through the house, looking for her.  As he passes the den, he sees Tyler standing inside, and goes into the dark room. It is the only personalized space we have seen in the house. A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva. Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels. Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety of tribal artifacts and marine specimens. The books include political literature, eastern religion, philosophy.  A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors: Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers. 
Tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and Johnny walks up behind her.  Shots of Bodhi surfing a monster wave, mountain-biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane, bungee-cord jumping, cliff diving. Every kamikaze activity in the book. 
TYLER Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies. 
UTAH What are you talking about? 
TYLER I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it. (she looks past Johnny, sees something) Hey, Bodhi. 
Utah turns.  Bodhi is in the doorway. 
BODHI Johnny has his own demons, don't you, Johnny? 
Bodhi seems to stare into him. Utah breaks the look.  Turns back to the photo gallery. Bodhi's eyes swivel.  He ponders something.  Looks at Tyler. 
BODHI Feel it? 
Roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway, wondering what happened to their leader.  He turns to them. 
BODHI Gentlemen, it's time. 
HOOT AND CHEERS.  Everyone bursts into motion.  Yelling and running through the house. 
UTAH What's goin' on? 
TYLER Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows. 
Bodhi returns from another room with... AN ALL-BLACK SURFBOARD.  It gleams like obsidian.  Near the tip, in small gray letters it says "Stealth Fighter".  Bodhi thrusts it into Johnny's hands. The others WHOOP maniacally. Johnny feels the challenge.  The pull of the tribe. 
BODHI Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little stealth mission. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LATIGO BEACH - NIGHT 
SIX DARK FIGURES walk toward us out of shafts of light... the headlights of Bodhi's CHEVY 4WD and Tyler's Porsche. The figures are Bodhi, Johnny, Tyler and the other surfers. ROSIE hangs back with the idling vehicles, tattooed arms crossed.  He puffs on a cigarette. 
A WIDE SHOT (MATTE) of the beach shows a pool of light from the headlights, beyond it a vast silver ocean under a black sky.  The full moon casts the world in cold monochrome.  The little figures reach the sea.

{"test1_input": "KELLY Now that's against the rules. \nGERMAN OFFICER (sneers) There are no rules in war. \nSuddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in the shadows. \nOnly Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly \"keep talking\" while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle. \nKELLY (to Officer) You've never killed anyone before, have you? \nGERMAN OFFICER I shower in the blood of my victims -- \nThe GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes. \nQuick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand. \nGI No wonder you smell so bad. \nGERMAN OFFICER Don't shoot, please. \nThe GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly. \nGI Will you look at the manners on this guy? (to German) Remember to thank me when I kill you. \nGERMAN OFFICER No, really, not in the neck - \nBut the GI does anyway. \nThe Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls. \nGI (to Kelly) You all right? \nKELLY Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway. \nGI You want me to give you a minute? \nKELLY That's okay. They'll get me eventually. If you can't get killed in a war, when can you? \nGI That's right. Look on the bright side. \nThe GI holds out his hand. \nGI Bart. Bart Bowland. \nKelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy. \nAbout his own age, but BART takes up more space. \nKELLY Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler. \nBART Kelly? \nKELLY (mimics) Bart? \nBART I mean - that's Irish, right? \nGERMAN OFFICER (from the floor, now with a decidedly American accent) Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but I have to interrupt. (to Bart) Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? You gave me a powder burn. \nKELLY Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should talk. You slapped me. I'm not your bitch. \nThe Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform. \nGERMAN OFFICER Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about? \nKELLY Well it didn't work, now did it? \nGERMAN OFFICER (shrugs) Sometimes I get so caught up in the moment. \nKELLY And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother? \nThe Officer grins. \nGERMAN OFFICER Inspired, wasn't it? \nBART Dude, you made him write to his mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil? \nINFANTRYMAN (also with American accent) Can we get up now? \nBart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex. \nBART Might as well. There's only an hour left anyway. \nThe German Officer crosses his arms. \nGERMAN OFFICER (to Kelly) Admit it. You were scared. \nKELLY (snorts) Right. \nKelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are still tied. \n", "test1_true": "The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some other SOLDIERS, done for the day. \nBart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep. \nBART That Willys yours? \nKELLY Yup. Just got her. Three summers packing out at Shop Rite. \nBart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt. \nThen he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas. \nThe Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud. \nKELLY My bad. Thanks though. \nKelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away. \nKELLY See you. \nBart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked. \nAbout a hundred feet away Kelly stops. \nKELLY Well, come on. \nBart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again. \nKELLY I couldn't resist. \nBart climbs in. \nBART Real funny, Ernswiler. You might still get your chance to die today. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, a few Scottish and North African irregulars. \"Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy\" plays on the jukebox. \nBart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food. \nBART Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock. \nKELLY (shrugs) That's what you get for invading Wisconsin. \nBART D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria. \nKELLY That's crazy. \nThey both eat for a minute. \nBART Where do you live, anyway? \nKELLY Shaker Heights. \nBART That explains the death wish. Me too. What street? \nKELLY Penn Place. \nBART (chewing) Hmm, don't know it. \nKELLY It's not technically in Shaker Heights - but I go to Shaker Heights High. \nPause. Kelly looks at Bart. \nBART Langely Prep. \nKELLY Sorry to hear that. \nBART Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop. \nKELLY Of course. I would have gone to Langely myself only my polo pony had the fits. \nBart throws his napkin on his plate. \nBART No matter. (raises his voice to address the room) We're all soldiers here. \nCROWD That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, cheers, etc. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY \nKelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out. \nBART You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower. \nKELLY I would, but then I might soil my croquet whites. You understand. \nBART How bourgeois. Cheerio then. \nKelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself. \n", "test1_id": 996, "test2_input": "KELLY You are William J. Stone of the 1st Airborne, pinned down in Noville. The Germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily. (starts throwing cans) You're holed up in a stone barn. Sustaining heavy casualties. Running low on ammo. The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies. \nSarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans. \nKELLY Your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. If you withdraw, the Germans will flank the entire Allied forces arrayed along Bastogne and break the front. What do you do? What do you do? \nSARAH Stop it! \nKelly goes back to stocking, satisfied. \nKELLY Battle of Bulge, the Southern Shoulder, December '44. \nSARAH Sorry I asked. \nSarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a peace offering. \nKELLY Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole shipment in of busted Oreo's. \nSarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it. \nSARAH I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there. \nINT. DAIRY BACKROOM \nSarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical. \nSARAH The frozen food woman came in with her kids. They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. One of the kids looked like cardboard. \nKELLY Do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food? \nSARAH No. \nKELLY Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food. \nHe fishes for a cookie. \nKELLY Next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food. \nAn ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart. \nWOMAN Is this store open? I've been waiting up front. If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours. \nSarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a cookie. \nSARAH Sorry about that. \nWOMAN I have a lot of coupons and I don't want to be here when they expire. \nKELLY (to Sarah) Charge her double for everything. \nSarah smiles and hurries away. \nINT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY \nKelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal. \nNo one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker. \nAs he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down. \nThey kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths. \nLance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing. \nLANCE What the fuck are you looking at, GI Jane? \nKelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker. \nLANCE No really, what makes you think you can look at me? \nKELLY I honestly didn't know it was you. I thought it was a free preview of the Spice Channel. \nLANCE That's pretty funny. You got dental insurance? \nKelly closes his locker and walks away. \nBridget wipes her mouth guiltily. \nLance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers. \nBRIDGET Stop it. \nShe walks away. \nLANCE What? What? \nINT. CLASSROOM -- DAY \nThe lights are off in history class. \n", "test2_true": "Mr. Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot. \nHe clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE, crouched over and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on screen. \nMR. NORMAN Whoops! \nHe hurries through to the next slide. \nIt doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep. \nExcept Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more Mr. Norman talks. \nMR. NORMAN And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks of Union soldiers fought bravely on. They were willing to give their lives so that others might be free. \nKelly shifts in his seat. \nMR. NORMAN Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler? \nKELLY No. \nBut Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again. \nHe waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad. \nKELLY Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure - but to insist on still characterizing the Civil War as some moral struggle? The soldiers were drafted - the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way out. (losing it) Why don't you talk about the Draft Riots? Where are your slides for that? \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nFresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy. \nKelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD, a well- groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor. \nHOLMSTEAD What gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum? \nKelly doesn't move. He's not into this. \nHOLMSTEAD Or question your teacher? \nKELLY I know. I mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog? Not Socrates. \nMs. Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of herself. He's a smart cookie. She's got to change her strategy. \nShe leans back in her chair. \nHOLMSTEAD Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But you're making some serious mistakes. \nKELLY I don't need to. Everyone else makes them for me. \nHer chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at Kelly intently. \nHOLMSTEAD This anger must be masking a lot of hurt. \nKELLY I was wondering what the tissues were for. \nHolmstead tries again. She looks down at his file. \nHOLMSTEAD I see you're not going to college next year. What are your plans? \nKelly shrugs. Holmstead searches his face for any clues. \nHOLMSTEAD How do I get through to you? \nKELLY Advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic. \nShe shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face clears. Something's clicked. \nHOLMSTEAD I think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential. \nEXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY \nSchool's been out for a while. The first rush had already left. \nKelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking lot to his Jeep. \nLance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him. \nLANCE You upset Bridget. \nKelly hardly stops walking. \nKELLY Give me a break. \nLANCE You need to apologize. \nKELLY What are you going to do, make out with me? \nLance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack. \nLANCE Why are you fucking with me? You little fucker. Want to play, fuckface? \n", "test2_id": 997, "test3_input": "Lance looks around eagerly. \nHe peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely contain his excitement. \nLANCE Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He needs his medicine. \nHe spots a WOMAN in the shadows. \nIt must be Bridget. \nHe unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees. \nLANCE I brought our friend along. He's happy to see you. \nHe rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage toward her. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly looks at his watch. \nINT. LANGELY PREP CLASSROOM \nBart looks at his watch in anticipation. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly flicks a switch and presses a button. \nINT. CAFETERIA \nThe crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound of the STAGE CURTAIN OPENING. \nThey squint from the BRIGHT STAGE LIGHTS. \nSHOCK ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau revealed to them: \nA frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a BLOW-UP DOLL tied to a chair. \nLANCE What the fuck are you all looking at? \nBridget, standing in the doorway, covers her mouth in horror. \nSTUDENT 1 Look, he's got a hard on. \nSTUDENT 2 Eeeeew. \nLance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly hysterical LAUGHTER. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight. Then he returns to military precision. He turns all the switches back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - NIGHT \nBart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch. He's overjoyed. \nBART You're kidding me. \nKELLY Yup. There it was. The whole school saw it. Wasn't too impressive either. \nThey raise their glasses to each other. \nBART To Operation Mincemeat. \nKELLY To the 193rd. \nThey both take swallows of scotch. Kelly retches. \nBART How does it feel to give better than you get? \nKelly finishes his scotch. \nKELLY Good. Real good. \nBART You want some more? \nKELLY (croaking) Don't mind if I do. \nBART That's my boy. \nThe drink again. Kelly's feet are up. For the first time, he looks comfortable. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nSarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine. \nKelly pulls up on the ELECTRO-SHOPPER with field goggles on. \nKELLY You know what this is? \n", "test3_true": "KELLY Eighteen volts of pure freedom. \nSARAH Sounds dangerous. \nKELLY Oh, it is. Unless you know how to handle it. \nKelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame. Then he looks up at Sarah. \nKELLY You ever seen the freshly waxed floor in the produce section glistening under full florescence? It's breathtaking. \nSarah gets on behind him. \nKELLY Hold on tight. \nHe puts his foot up and kicks it into gear. \nThe Electro-shopper takes off - barely. Kelly takes the corner too sharp and clips the edge of an END CAP DISPLAY of cereal boxes -- they fall to the floor. \nThe Electro-shopper inches forward. \nKELLY Close call. \nSARAH Have you been drinking? \nINT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nKelly looks in at his parents, checking to make sure they're still asleep. \nWhen he leaves ABE opens his eyes and listens to the door CLOSE downstairs. \nINT. EVE'S STUDIO \nKelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY \nKelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack. Minnie opens the door. \nMINNIE Kelly? Bart's not here, he - \nKELLY Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm here to see Tabby. Just to do a little painting with her. \nMINNIE She's out back in her studio. \nKELLY Thanks. \nINT. TABBY'S STUDIO \nTabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in her hand. \nMusic's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door opens, surprised. \nTABBY Kelly? \nKELLY Hey. I warned you I'd come. \nTABBY You did. \nShe goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation. \nShe doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the same place. \nKELLY Maybe I should go -- \nTABBY Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set your canvas up. Use one of the ones in the corner. \nKelly looks through them and picks one. \nTABBY Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in the drawer. \nKELLY I brought my own. \nHe takes off his backpack and opens it. \nTABBY Well then. \nKelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies. \nHe can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and she glows. She catches him looking. \nKELLY Does it mess up your concentration? Me being here? \nTABBY No. \nShe turns back to her painting. \nKELLY Oh. That's good. \nKelly sets up his canvas. \n", "test3_id": 998}

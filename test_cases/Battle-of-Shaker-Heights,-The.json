{"train": "THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS \nWritten by \nErica Beeney \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nDISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE \nMuffled by the wet green forest. \nThe very earth seems to tremble. \nA RABBIT \nDarts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air. \nLOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES \nVOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion. \nA DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death. \nA pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE. \nFor a moment the forest takes a breath. \nNothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears. \nA Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth. \nIt's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER. \nEighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias indicate he's in the 29th Infantry. \nHis face might be attractive, under other conditions. \nHe pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard- issue field jacket. \nKELLY Where the hell are those Krauts? \nTo give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's \"I'll Be Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]\" while maneuvering the Jeep through the bushes and rocks. \nHe drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and tries to go over it. \nThe Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log. \nThe BACK TIRES spin. \nKelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his face. Assesses the situation. \nHe grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever \nthe Jeep free. When -- \nThe STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him. \nThe branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls in the mud. \nKELLY Shit. \nDetermined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest. \nEXT. CLEARING \nKelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun. \nAcross the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN. \nBut not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around the corner of it. \nKelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation. \nUnaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move. \nThey're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their Karabiners rest slung across their backs. \nKELLY Bingo. \nAGAINST THE TREE \nKelly focuses himself. \nThen he shoulders his carbine. \nPulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly. \nEXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK \nKelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning at precarious angles. \nKelly washes his Jeep in the driveway. \nEXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - NIGHT \nKelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it. \nKELLY Sleep tight Hot Lips. \nINT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nKelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches. A great big pile of cheese and PB&J. \nABE Sergeant Keller! How was the war? Did we win? \nKelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's downright angry. \nKELLY Let me guess. Happy Meals for the wavy gravy wellness center? \nAbe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A bit ill-used by life. The phrase \"rode hard and put away wet\" comes to mind. \nABE As usual, your cynicism is refreshing. \nHe finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile. \nKelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back tightens. He slams the door with his foot. \nKELLY As usual, your cheerful optimism makes me ill. \nAbe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. The hostility is nothing new. \nABE (lightly) You should get that checked. \nKelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door. \nKELLY (O.S.) Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif Garrett for me. \nINT. ERNSWILER GARAGE - NIGHT \nKelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in. \nA family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER. \nFinished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have on hats or clothes. \nKelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes with a paintbrush. \nEve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers Kelly's friends would have crushes on. If he had any friends. \nMAO (to Kelly) Son of Eve. You are very dirty. \nKELLY (awkward) A rough charge. You know. \nEVE (to Kelly) Don't touch anything. We have to get ready for the Starving Artist show. (to Xiou-Xiou) Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy - see? \nEve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French court dress. Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder. \nEVE Now you try. \nGrandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting. \nEVE (to Kelly) She loves the gold. Always overuses it. And usually her touch is so light. \nXIOU-XIOU Gold is the color of the sun. \nEve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings in progress. \nKELLY You know why we never have anything to eat in this house? \nBut Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting. She's not paying attention to Kelly. \nEVE Mao, what did we say about the eyes? \nShe gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style, lots of pastels, very abstract. \nMao looks at her quizzically. \nMAO More - empathy? \nEVE That's right. And didn't I tell you to put in more cacti? \nMAO (shakes head) No, no more cacti. Too busy. Simplicity is best. \nHis family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement. \nEve rolls her eyes. \nKELLY You are William J. Stone of the 1st Airborne, pinned down in Noville. The Germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily. (starts throwing cans) You're holed up in a stone barn. Sustaining heavy casualties. Running low on ammo. The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies. \nSarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans. \nKELLY Your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. If you withdraw, the Germans will flank the entire Allied forces arrayed along Bastogne and break the front. What do you do? What do you do? \nSARAH Stop it! \nKelly goes back to stocking, satisfied. \nKELLY Battle of Bulge, the Southern Shoulder, December '44. \nSARAH Sorry I asked. \nSarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a peace offering. \nKELLY Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole shipment in of busted Oreo's. \nSarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it. \nSARAH I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there. \nINT. DAIRY BACKROOM \nSarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical. \nSARAH The frozen food woman came in with her kids. They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. One of the kids looked like cardboard. \nKELLY Do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food? \nSARAH No. \nKELLY Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food. \nHe fishes for a cookie. \nKELLY Next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food. \nAn ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart. \nWOMAN Is this store open? I've been waiting up front. If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours. \nSarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a cookie. \nSARAH Sorry about that. \nWOMAN I have a lot of coupons and I don't want to be here when they expire. \nKELLY (to Sarah) Charge her double for everything. \nSarah smiles and hurries away. \nINT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY \nKelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal. \nNo one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker. \nAs he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down. \nThey kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths. \nLance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing. \nLANCE What the fuck are you looking at, GI Jane? \nKelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker. \nLANCE No really, what makes you think you can look at me? \nKELLY I honestly didn't know it was you. I thought it was a free preview of the Spice Channel. \nLANCE That's pretty funny. You got dental insurance? \nKelly closes his locker and walks away. \nBridget wipes her mouth guiltily. \nLance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers. \nBRIDGET Stop it. \nShe walks away. \nLANCE What? What? \nINT. CLASSROOM -- DAY \nThe lights are off in history class. \nKELLY You just used fuck as a verb, noun, and adjective. Impressive. \nKelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of him. \nLANCE Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got in his knapsack. \nLance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems unconcerned. \nSuddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack. \nLance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it, gleeful. \nLance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him. \nLance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car. \nKelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance drives off. \nFinally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot and HONKS the horn. \nKelly shakes his head. \nKELLY Rim job. \nINT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY \nKelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a replacement. From his post behind the counter, Bart sees him and comes over. \nBART Kelly. Hey. \nKELLY You work here? \nBART Just a couple days a month, to get a heads-up on the latest stuff. What are you doing? \nKELLY Looking for a backpack. \nBART Is that all? Don't bother. I have a couple extras at home. I could give you one if you want. \nKELLY (beat) Sure, I guess. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - DAY \nKelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for Bart to get the key from the desk to open the door in the corner. The door finally swings open. \nINT. STOREROOM \nBart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war memorabilia. Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened flags. \nKELLY Very impressive. \nBART My dad's real into hoarding. \nKelly holds up a flask in a leather case. \nKELLY What's this? \nBART Grant's field flask. \nKELLY Wow. Your dad should meet my history teacher. He sent me to the principal's office today for questioning his G- rated interpretation of the Civil War. \nBART Forget him. \nKELLY I would, but now the principal's making me give a speech on the Civil War at an assembly. \nBART (laughing in sympathy and amusement) What is he, some kind of sadist? \nKELLY She thinks she's doing me a favor. \nBART Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up. Are you? \nKELLY Depends on who you ask. Everyone's got an opinion. \nBART (grabs box) Take this. That'll shut them up. \nBart opens the long box. Nestled inside is a leg bone with a foot attached to it. \nBART Stonewall Jackson's. \nKELLY Yeah right. \nBART Can you imagine that? Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse? Unbelievable. What balls. \nKelly nods. That is balls. \nBART He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing. I saw a backpack in here somewhere. \nBart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles. \nINT. BOWLAND KITCHEN \nKelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up. \nBRIDGET Lance! \nLance looks over at her and releases Kelly. \nLANCE Okay babe. (to Kelly) One day you and me will be alone. And won't that be nice? \nKelly is hurt but covering. \nKELLY Too bad my mom won't let me date yet. \nKelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the dry inside of his mouth with his tongue. \nHe turns slowly and trudges up the stairs. \nSarah has been watching the whole thing from the door. \nSARAH Why do you mess with him? \nKELLY You're right. I should give him a break. \nINT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY \nKelly watches TV in the living room. His cheek has a nice bruise on it. Eve enters. \nEVE Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need you to go to the art supply store for me. \nKelly looks at the TV. \nKELLY Get Abe to do it. \nEve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her wallet. \nEVE He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House. \nKELLY What a surprise. \nEVE I'll make it up to you. \nKELLY Where have I heard that before? \nEve sighs. \nEVE When are you going to give me a break? \nKelly jabs at the remote. \nKELLY Let me think - maybe when I finally forget every single word of The Little Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in the car waiting for him to score. No, probably when I don't prepare myself before I go into the bathroom, expecting to find him passed out on the floor. \nEve waits through this. \nKELLY Actually, you know what? I know I'll be able to put it all behind me when I go away to college. (slaps his forehead, pretend remembering) Only, I can't go because someone spent my college fund on Mexican Black Tar. So looks like I'll have to try to forget at Shop Rite, where I'll be working for the rest of my life. \nEVE You're right. You have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up. But please just get me some paints first. \nEve comes over to Kelly. He sighs and puts his hand out. \nKELLY What do you need? \nShe gives him the money. \nEVE We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue. (looks at him) What happened to your face? \nShe puts her hand up but he moves away from it. \nKELLY Forget it. \nINT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY \nKelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes. \nHe's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner. Almost leaves. \nInstead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye. \nKELLY They're having a sale on glitter. \nIt takes Tabby a second to recognize him. \nTABBY Oh, hello. What happened to you? \nKELLY (shrugs) Tennis injury. \nTabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether to believe him. \nTabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints. \nKelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle. \nTABBY Very funny, wiseass. \nKelly resumes his tour of the room. \nKELLY It must be nice to have a place like this to get away to. \nTABBY It is. \nKELLY What about Farmer? \nTABBY Farmer? \nTabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths. \nKELLY The boyfriend. \nTABBY (laughs) Miner? What about him? \nKELLY Is he an artist, too? \nTABBY No. Definitely not. Thank god. \nKelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light. \nTABBY You said your mom was a painter? \nKELLY She was, well - is I guess. \nTabby cuts the canvas. \nTABBY What do you mean? \nKELLY She used to be. But then my dad - wasn't working anymore so she turned it into a business. She has a family of Chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her. \nTABBY Like Andy Warhol's Factory. \nKELLY More like Andy Warhol's tool shed. It was nice before, though. My playpen used to be in her studio. \nTABBY Wow. So you really grew up with it. What does, did, your dad do? \nKELLY He's a VH-1 documentary without the music. \nTABBY \"Tragedy struck?\" \nKelly nods. \nKELLY \"And then, things took a turn for the worse.\" \nTABBY Well, just wait. Those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback tour. \nKELLY I already changed the channel. \nTabby sits back on her heels and looks at him. \nBart's head appears in the open door. \nBART Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a little supply line assist and you're gone for days. Come on. \nTABBY Have fun, boys. \nKELLY If only it were fun. War's deadly serious, ma'am. \nTABBY (to Bart) And I used to think you were the only crazy one. \nBART Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi Hannah. \nBart leaves. Kelly stands by the door. This is his only chance. \nKELLY I'm worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised. \nTABBY Are you? \nKELLY Yes. I might have to come by and show you the proper safety procedures. Some time in the presence of an art prodigy would do you good. \nTABBY I don't think I have room for a playpen in here. \nKELLY Ouch. \nTabby smiles. Kelly leaves. \nEXT. BOWLAND YARD - NIGHT \nBart and Kelly walk across the yard. \nBART So, you have a thing for my sister? \nKELLY What? No, no. \nBART Everybody does. \nThrough the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of his house. \nKELLY I think he's leaving. \nBART Let me see. Don't be a farb, give them up. \nKelly hands the glasses over. Bart looks through them. Then he puts them down. \nBART The coast is clear. \nThe boys looks at each other. \nBART Let me prepare to deploy. \nBart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit which he puts on. Kelly looks through the binoculars. \nKELLY Is this going to work? \nBART We've planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power. \nKELLY Save it for the press conference. \nTHE LAWN \nThe boys climb down out of the tree house. \nBart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox. \nBART Stay low. On my signal. \nHe looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures \"go.\" They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them. \nBart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering his mouth. \nKelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across the lawn. \nThe girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs towards the opposite side of the house. \nHe puts the girl down, still covering her mouth. \nKELLY We're the good guys. If you scream, the bad guys are going to come and burn down your house. Okay? So stay here and be quiet. \nThe girl nods. Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts to sneak away. \nGIRL My dad has a gun. \nKelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door. \nIN FRONT OF LANCE'S HOUSE \nBart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell. \nLANCE'S MOTHER opens the door. Bart confers with her briefly and steps inside. The door closes behind him. \nKelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the NEIGHBOR come up behind him. \nNEIGHBOR Can I help you, young man? \nKelly starts and turns. \nKELLY I was just inspecting your lawn. \nKelly grabs a few blades of grass. \nKELLY Have you thought about Astroturf? It takes a lot less water to keep green. I mean, no water, technically. \nNEIGHBOR I'm not interested. \nKELLY Oh. I see. Okay then. \nKelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only - Lance PULLS UP in his SUV. \nKelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into the house. \nKELLY Oh, shit. \nLance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car. \nKELLY Oh, shit. \nKelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him and Lance. \nBart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie. He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk. \nLANCE Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss some day. \nBart nods and tips his HARD HAT. \nKelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until Lance's house is out of sight. \nBART Exactly. \nBart and Kelly share a look. Kelly grins. \nKELLY Let's draw up the plans. \nBART I have a few notes jotted down. \nAll we have to do is fill in the details and let Operation Deadmeat begin. \nINT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY \nBridget primps at her locker while Kelly watches nervously from his. \nWhen she starts to close the locker door, Kelly rushes towards her and BUMPS into her. Her books and papers spill to the floor. \nKELLY Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry - \nHe starts picking them up. \nBRIDGET Oh, it's okay - \nShe looks around. If Lance showed up it wouldn't be good for either of them. \nKelly hands her the rest of her stuff. They part ways. \nKelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket. \nPrincipal Holmstead CLICKS down the hall in her heels and Kelly DUCKS into a doorway just in time. He turns and pretends to look at a posted announcement as she passes. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBart inspects Bridget's book report with a jeweler's loop. \nHe swings over to a piece of stationary Kelly's working on. \nBART She dots her I's with hearts. And her L's are loopier. The L is very important. \nKELLY I'm working on it. \nThey both crouch over the paper. \nKELLY I feel kind of bad for her. She's a nice girl. \nBART Sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided. \nKELLY Stop it. \nHe pushes back from the table. \nKELLY How does that look? \nBART (inspecting) Pretty good. I think we're ready to manufacture a document. \nKelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper. \nBART (clears his throat) Begin. \"Hey Daddy. It's your birthday and you've been a very bad boy. But so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy have to get punished, only this time \nINT. LANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLance, shirtless, reads aloud from the letter. \nLANCE (Cont.) - baby makes the rules. Await further instructions at school tomorrow -- \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat next to Kelly. \nLANCE (V.O. cont'd) -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy least expects her. Love, Bridgie.\" Yes! \nBART Do you have everything? \nKelly just looks at him. Bart's already asked this question. \nBART We can't afford any errors. \nKELLY You don't need to tell me. It's my ass on the line. \nKelly pulls up in front of Bart's school. \nBart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder. \nBART I wish I could be there to see it. \nKELLY You'll get the de-brief. \nBART It's a day that will live in infamy. \nKELLY You couldn't do any better than that? \nLance looks around eagerly. \nHe peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely contain his excitement. \nLANCE Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He needs his medicine. \nHe spots a WOMAN in the shadows. \nIt must be Bridget. \nHe unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees. \nLANCE I brought our friend along. He's happy to see you. \nHe rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage toward her. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly looks at his watch. \nINT. LANGELY PREP CLASSROOM \nBart looks at his watch in anticipation. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly flicks a switch and presses a button. \nINT. CAFETERIA \nThe crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound of the STAGE CURTAIN OPENING. \nThey squint from the BRIGHT STAGE LIGHTS. \nSHOCK ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau revealed to them: \nA frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a BLOW-UP DOLL tied to a chair. \nLANCE What the fuck are you all looking at? \nBridget, standing in the doorway, covers her mouth in horror. \nSTUDENT 1 Look, he's got a hard on. \nSTUDENT 2 Eeeeew. \nLance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly hysterical LAUGHTER. \nINT. LIGHTING BOOTH \nKelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight. Then he returns to military precision. He turns all the switches back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - NIGHT \nBart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch. He's overjoyed. \nBART You're kidding me. \nKELLY Yup. There it was. The whole school saw it. Wasn't too impressive either. \nThey raise their glasses to each other. \nBART To Operation Mincemeat. \nKELLY To the 193rd. \nThey both take swallows of scotch. Kelly retches. \nBART How does it feel to give better than you get? \nKelly finishes his scotch. \nKELLY Good. Real good. \nBART You want some more? \nKELLY (croaking) Don't mind if I do. \nBART That's my boy. \nThe drink again. Kelly's feet are up. For the first time, he looks comfortable. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nSarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine. \nKelly pulls up on the ELECTRO-SHOPPER with field goggles on. \nKELLY You know what this is? \nKelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl of her strokes. \nHe dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's restrained and confident movements. \nEve leans against the doorframe. \nEVE Hey you two. I'll try not to act surprised. It might spoil the moment. \nKelly puts down the paintbrush. \nKELLY I can't do this. I have to go. \nEVE Keller, I think I'm missing some art supplies. Have you seen them around the house? \nKelly avoids her eyes as he leaves. \nKELLY No, I haven't. \nEVE I don't know what to do with him. \nXIOU-XIOU You son is not yet cooked. Give him time. \nEve looks over Xiou-Xiou's shoulder. \nEVE When are you going to let me give you your own show? We could do it for real. \nXIOU-XIOU No problem. When you offer me an eighty-twenty split. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nKelly eats with the Bowlands - Bart's mom, MATHILDA, his dad HARRISON, and Tabby and Bart. \nThe Bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good Wasp family. \nBART (to Harrison) -- But I told you I want to take German -- \nHARRISON German's a Cold War language. You can't get any kind of State Department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. You'll take Chinese. \nBart frowns. \nHARRISON Are we on the same page? \nBART (mutters) Same page. \nEveryone eats in silence. \nMATHILDA (to Tabby) So darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement? \nTabby puts down her fork. \nTABBY I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I don't care who sits next to whom. I should have eloped. \nKELLY After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes when you bite the bullet, it explodes in your mouth. \nMathilda looks surprised. This could go either way. \nMATHILDA (tentatively) Why, I've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it? You wouldn't say, \"Sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants,\" would you? \nHARRISON But have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it? \nKELLY Yeah, but they never take a bite out of their pants. \nEveryone but Bart LAUGHS. \nTabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of a conversation she didn't want to have. \nMATHILDA What an unusual conversation! Do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, Kelly? \nKELLY Basically. I ask why all the furniture is missing and my Dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. \nAll but Bart LAUGHS again. \nTABBY He talks about art. \nBART/MATHILDA You do? \nKelly looks down at his plate. \nKELLY My mother's kind of an artist, so - \nHARRISON You come from a creative family, do you? \nMathilda salts her food. \nMATHILDA I wish my boys would talk to me about my passions. I can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden. \nKELLY I noticed your magnolias. Very fine specimens. \nMATHILDA They are fine, aren't they? \nKelly frowns at the Principal's back as she CLICKS away. \nSarah appears. They walk down the hall together. \nSARAH What presentation? \nKELLY I don't want to talk about it. As a matter of fact, do me a favor and pretend you never heard anything about it. \nSARAH Okay. Um. \nKELLY What, Sarah? \nSARAH It's nothing. I - \nKelly starts to pull ahead. \nSARAH I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith this weekend. \nKELLY Aw Sarah, that's really great, I mean. It's just that - I'm busy. \nSARAH Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see you in the dairy section, though. \nKELLY Right. \nShe stands there looking lost. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY \nKelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep. Bart pulls up to the curb in his BMW. \nKELLY What are you doing here? \nBART I tracked you down. There's someone I'd like you to meet. \nINT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY \nA few OLD SOLDIERS sit sunning in chairs in the industrial feeling living-room. \nBart and Kelly sit across from CHARLIE HAYES, an old black guy, playing dominos. \nCHARLIE (to Kelly) Are you one too? \nKELLY Yup. \nCHARLIE And what do you see in that? \nKELLY Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery - the big stuff. Things we don't have anymore. \nCHARLIE I see. \nCharlie sorts his tiles and scowls. He leans in to Kelly's face, giving him the eye. \nCHARLIE And do you think it's brave getting trench foot and syphilis, eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can? \nKelly is taken aback by this. \nKELLY Well, no - \nCharlie leans back and nods, thinking about Kelly's response. He no longer seems angry. \nCHARLIE Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, would it? \nKELLY No, sir. \nCharlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin. \nCHARLIE Parts of it were kind of fun though. I got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the Ardennes living off what I could kill. (pause) I felt very close to the land. \nBart gives Kelly a significant look. Kelly doesn't notice. \nHe's looking closely at Charlie. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nKelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the window. \nBART I met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the Youth Group. \nKELLY You don't really believe that stuff about Berlin? And Hitler's compound? \nBART Does it matter? \nKELLY Of course it matters. Doesn't the truth matter? \nBart grins. \nBART I don't know. You tell me. \nKelly avoids this by getting out of the car. \nKelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself to say what's really on his mind. \nKELLY Remember that stupid speech? \nKelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns. \nHe knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff. \nKELLY I'm supposed to give it next week. \nBart polishes his combat boots. \nBART Maybe you should talk to my dad about it. \nKELLY You think he'd go for that? \nBart keeps his head down, polishes intently. \nBART Of course. He loves you. He was talking the other day about helping you out. (ironic) Want to go to Dartmouth? \nKELLY Are you serious? \nBART He was. If you applied for Spring Semester, he could \"pull some strings.\" \nKELLY (shakes his head slowly) I don't think that would work for me. Considering -- my background. \nBART Yeah, probably not. \nKELLY I'm not properly socialized. I wouldn't fit in. \nBart checks his bandoleer and cartridges. \nBART That's bullshit. \nKELLY No, it's not. \nBART Tell that to my family. They're like your fucking fan club. \nBart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly. \nBART Even Tabby likes you. \nKELLY So much she ratted me out to you. \nBART Well, she's inviting you to the wedding. \nKELLY Oh. \nBart watches Kelly's face. \nBART But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you? \nKELLY I don't know what you're talking about. Weddings? I love weddings. I always get drunk and make out with someone's cousin. \nBart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head. \nBART Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little action. \nKELLY Fletcher, eh? \nBART He's twelve. Let me give some advice. He's very into sharks at the moment. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT \nKelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door. \nThere he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls. \nHe goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio. \nINT. TABBY'S STUDIO \nTabby sits on the couch facing away from the door. Kelly enters. \nKELLY Why did you tell -- \nTabby turns toward him. She's crying. \nKELLY What? Oh, I'm sorry. \nHe knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there. \nKelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture. \nTabby dabs at her face. \nTABBY Miner and I broke up. \nBeat. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBart sits in his desk chair, frowning. \nMathilda knocks and opens the door. \nMATHILDA Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly coming over? \nBART Not tonight, ma. \nMathilda pauses and looks at her son. \nMATHILDA Okay, then. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY \nAn ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a van. \nThe DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize. \nKelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean uniform. \nDIRECTOR Are you with the 101st or the 82nd? \nKELLY Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual division. Technically, my patches indicate - \nDIRECTOR Whatever. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be a while setting up. Some of the other boys are over by craft service. \nKELLY Oh? \nKelly doesn't go anywhere. \nDIRECTOR The snack table. It's over there. Someone will come get you when we're ready. \nKELLY Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet? \nDIRECTOR Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't know. \nKELLY Ok. Thanks. \nCRAFT SERVICE \nKelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks. \nA MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds. \nMAKEUP ARTIST (to Kelly) And you are? \nKELLY Kelly Ernswiler, private first class. \nMAKEUP ARTIST All right, Kelly. Let's take a look at you. \nShe gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair, slicking it back. \nMAKEUP ARTIST That's it, handsome. \nKelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again. \nHe scans the crowd. No Bart. \nThe A.D. walks over. \nA.D. Okay, everyone. We're going to start positioning. Then we'll go through a few rehearsals. (points at soldiers) You, you and you - go over there by that tree. You and you guys, behind the hill. (looks at clipboard) Okay, who's got the Jeep? \nKELLY That MG? She's mine. \nA.D. Great. We'd like to use it. Can you drive it beyond the hill over there? \nKelly tries to act casual. \nKELLY Sure. I don't think that would be a problem. \nHe walks towards his Jeep and pauses. \nKELLY Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he checked in? \nA.D. Don't know. We've got enough people. It doesn't matter. \nKelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten. \nKELLY (to Jeep) Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to be famous. \nA.D. (yells) Okay people. Listen to my voice. From now on, you do whatever this voice says. Take your place. \nBEHIND THE HILL \nKelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored. \nHe sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees. \nKelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives away. \nA.D. (to cameraman) Follow him. Are you getting it? \nBart sits on the ground, out of breath. \nA.D. We can use this. We'll cut it together. \nThe A.D. directs the camera at Bart. \nA.D. Get close on him. \nBart pushes the camera away. \nINT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY \nKelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling. There's a cut across his eyebrow. \nEve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed. \nKELLY I don't want to talk about it. \nEVE Well, you're going to have to. Your father's at the hospital. \nKELLY Which one of his loser friends ended up there? \nEve plays with her keys. Then she stops. \nEVE They think he has stomach cancer. \nKelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream. \nThen he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom. \nKELLY Oh this is just perfect. \nEve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still trying to deal. \nEVE Why would you say something like that? \nKELLY Because it seems to fit. \nEVE \"Seems to fit.\" Do you understand what I just said? \nKelly gets up. Puts his feet on the floor. His shoulders are slumped. \nKELLY Why, do you want to say it again? \nEVE Kelly - \nKELLY I have to go to work. \nHe gets up and holds the door open for her. Eve looks at him, heart heavy. She leaves. \nKelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting. \nHe grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the floor so he doesn't have to look at it. \nThe painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's rifle and TEARS. \nHe KICKS it. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nKelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels. \nHe RIPS open the box and they roll everywhere. \nSarah watches from checkout. She comes over to help him pick them up. \nSARAH I forgot to tell you this box was booby-trapped. \nKelly doesn't say anything. \nSARAH The concert was lame. The opening act singer ripped his leather pants during a stupid dance routine and stormed off stage. (pause, looks at his cut) Are you okay? \nKELLY No. \nSARAH Lance? \nKELLY No. \nKelly gathers an armful of paper towels. \nKELLY Listen, I'm busy. \nSARAH Sure. I understand. \nKELLY I doubt it. \nKelly closes his eyes. He had forgotten - or tried to forget. \nMR. NORMAN Let's all make our way in an orderly fashion down to the auditorium, shall we? \nThe class bolts for the door. \nMR. NORMAN Orderly, I said orderly. \nMr. Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly. \nMR. NORMAN Well, what are we waiting for? I'm so looking forward to hearing your views. \nINT. AUDITORIUM \nKelly sits in a chair on the stage next to Mr. Norman. \nA scattering of KIDS sit out in the auditorium. \nPrincipal Holmstead stands at the podium. \nHOLMSTEAD For those of you who haven't had the chance to get to know Kelly, you should know he has a very interesting hobby. He takes part in reenactments of World War II battles right here in Ohio. \nAUDIENCE KID I did that too. When I was seven. \nScattered LAUGHTER. Kelly frowns. \nHOLMSTEAD He has an unusual first-hand knowledge of history. We recently discovered that this extends beyond World War II to the Civil War, which he is going to discuss with you today. Kelly? \nKelly rises to scant applause. He stands at the podium, looking out at the crowd. \nHe looks down and thinks. He looks back up. The silence stretches. Kids start giggling. \nFinally he leans into the microphone. \nKELLY I'm sorry. \nHe walks off stage. \nHOLMSTEAD (to Mr. Norman) Well, go after him. \nEXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY \nOn his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder and madder. Just as he's about to get it undone -- \nLance appears. \nLANCE What, they re-assign you to the bicycle brigade? \nKelly frowns at the lock. \nKELLY I'm busy. \nLANCE Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember that little show I put on for the school? \nKELLY I don't know what you're talking about. \nLANCE Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard on? \nKelly looks up at Lance. \nKELLY Oh that. I heard about it. \nLANCE And did you hear me and Bridget aren't going out anymore because of it? \nKELLY I haven't been following the story. \nLANCE Yeah well, let's get this over with. \nKELLY It is over. \nLance pushes Kelly away from his bike. Kelly falls back on his hands. \nHe squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike. \nLance KICKS him back with his foot and looks at him. \nKELLY Just let me go home. \nLANCE Did you call me a homo? \nLance KICKS him again. Kelly breathes hard. \nKELLY This isn't a good time for me. Let's re-schedule. \nLANCE No time like the present. \nLance picks Kelly up and SLAPS him hard on the face. \nKELLY First you should probably get me to write home to my mother. \nEve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge. \nEVE (yelling) What is wrong with you? When are you going to stop blaming us, blaming him? I'm sick of you being angry. I want to be angry! They just took out half of your father's stomach - \nKELLY Enough. \nEVE (screaming and crying) You will not tell me what's enough. You don't know about anything. All you do is fight fake battles, in the woods, on the playground. But this, right here, us - this is the real one, the only one worth anything. \nShe stops and breaks down. \nEVE The man I love is dying. \nKELLY That's between you and him. \nEve looks at her son. Her face looks older. \nEVE If I made a mistake, if you felt left out, I'm sorry. But I can only deal with one thing at a time. \nEve leaves. Kelly sits on the toilet, lost. \nINT. KELLY'S ROOM - MORNING \nThe sun shines in through Kelly's window. \nHe's laying in bed awake - has been for a while. \nHe gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the tie's too short. \nHe pulls the suit out of his closet. \nThe jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to his wrists. \nAnd he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket. \nHe pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there. \nHe sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands. \nHe looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it. \nHe shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that. \nThen he sighs. \nEXT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH - DAY \nIt's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the banisters. \nGUESTS trickle in. \nHarrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel, talks to an USHER. \nHARRISON Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters next to me if you can help it. (to guest) Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank you for coming. \nBart comes outside, also dressed as an usher. \nHARRISON (to Bart) Where's the priest? \nBART He should be here any minute. Calm down. \nBart walks down the steps and looks down the street. \nKelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM. \nBart walks down the street to meet him. \nBART What the fuck are you doing? \nKelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes. \nKELLY I was invited. \nBART I uninvited you. \nKELLY It's not your wedding. \nBart looks at Kelly and shakes his head. \nBART Why are you wearing that? \nKelly doesn't answer. \nBART (softening) I can't let you come in. \nKELLY Why? \nBART Because you know why. Just go home. \nKelly finally looks up at Bart and nods. \nAbe looks at Kelly. \nABE I bet you could. \nKelly nods. Eve wakes up. \nEVE Kelly, is that you? \nKELLY You were expecting some one else? \nHOSPITAL CORRIDOR \nKelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine. \nKELLY He looks good. \nEve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness. \nEVE He looks just like you. \nKelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too much. \nHe breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced rage, the fights and the stubbornness. \nBut finally, relief. \nThey walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and puts her hand on Kelly's neck. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY \nKelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees the car packed up in front. \nBart comes out with a box of stuff. \nBART Hey. \nKELLY Hey. You going away already? \nBART Yeah. The have this intensive summer orientation thing. \nKELLY Is that good? \nBart puts the box in the car. \nBART Well, it's optional, but dad thinks it would be \"a good way to meet people.\" \nKELLY He's probably right. \nBART He usually is. \nThey stand there. \nKELLY Well, go Big Green. \nKelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles. \nKelly's been doing his research. \nBART Thanks. \nKelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike. \nKELLY Have fun. And get laid, will ya? \nBart laughs a little and shakes his head. Kelly is gone. \nHarrison comes out. \nHARRISON Is that everything? \nBART Everything you'd let me bring. \nHarrison checks the ties on the roof. \nHARRISON Give me a break. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nKelly stocks shelves. \nThere's a NEW GIRL working the register. \nKelly sees SARAH come in. He follows her to the bakery. \nKELLY Hey. \nSARAH Hey. \nSarah picks some bagels. \n", "test1_input": "KELLY Now that's against the rules. \nGERMAN OFFICER (sneers) There are no rules in war. \nSuddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in the shadows. \nOnly Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly \"keep talking\" while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle. \nKELLY (to Officer) You've never killed anyone before, have you? \nGERMAN OFFICER I shower in the blood of my victims -- \nThe GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes. \nQuick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand. \nGI No wonder you smell so bad. \nGERMAN OFFICER Don't shoot, please. \nThe GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly. \nGI Will you look at the manners on this guy? (to German) Remember to thank me when I kill you. \nGERMAN OFFICER No, really, not in the neck - \nBut the GI does anyway. \nThe Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls. \nGI (to Kelly) You all right? \nKELLY Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway. \nGI You want me to give you a minute? \nKELLY That's okay. They'll get me eventually. If you can't get killed in a war, when can you? \nGI That's right. Look on the bright side. \nThe GI holds out his hand. \nGI Bart. Bart Bowland. \nKelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy. \nAbout his own age, but BART takes up more space. \nKELLY Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler. \nBART Kelly? \nKELLY (mimics) Bart? \nBART I mean - that's Irish, right? \nGERMAN OFFICER (from the floor, now with a decidedly American accent) Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but I have to interrupt. (to Bart) Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? You gave me a powder burn. \nKELLY Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should talk. You slapped me. I'm not your bitch. \nThe Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform. \nGERMAN OFFICER Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about? \nKELLY Well it didn't work, now did it? \nGERMAN OFFICER (shrugs) Sometimes I get so caught up in the moment. \nKELLY And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother? \nThe Officer grins. \nGERMAN OFFICER Inspired, wasn't it? \nBART Dude, you made him write to his mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil? \nINFANTRYMAN (also with American accent) Can we get up now? \nBart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex. \nBART Might as well. There's only an hour left anyway. \nThe German Officer crosses his arms. \nGERMAN OFFICER (to Kelly) Admit it. You were scared. \nKELLY (snorts) Right. \nKelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are still tied. \n", "test1_true": "The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some other SOLDIERS, done for the day. \nBart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep. \nBART That Willys yours? \nKELLY Yup. Just got her. Three summers packing out at Shop Rite. \nBart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt. \nThen he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas. \nThe Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud. \nKELLY My bad. Thanks though. \nKelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away. \nKELLY See you. \nBart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked. \nAbout a hundred feet away Kelly stops. \nKELLY Well, come on. \nBart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again. \nKELLY I couldn't resist. \nBart climbs in. \nBART Real funny, Ernswiler. You might still get your chance to die today. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, a few Scottish and North African irregulars. \"Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy\" plays on the jukebox. \nBart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food. \nBART Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock. \nKELLY (shrugs) That's what you get for invading Wisconsin. \nBART D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria. \nKELLY That's crazy. \nThey both eat for a minute. \nBART Where do you live, anyway? \nKELLY Shaker Heights. \nBART That explains the death wish. Me too. What street? \nKELLY Penn Place. \nBART (chewing) Hmm, don't know it. \nKELLY It's not technically in Shaker Heights - but I go to Shaker Heights High. \nPause. Kelly looks at Bart. \nBART Langely Prep. \nKELLY Sorry to hear that. \nBART Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop. \nKELLY Of course. I would have gone to Langely myself only my polo pony had the fits. \nBart throws his napkin on his plate. \nBART No matter. (raises his voice to address the room) We're all soldiers here. \nCROWD That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, cheers, etc. \nEXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY \nKelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out. \nBART You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower. \nKELLY I would, but then I might soil my croquet whites. You understand. \nBART How bourgeois. Cheerio then. \nKelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself. \n", "test2_input": "BART General Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend. \nKelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously. \nBART Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even. \nThe skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth exchange. \nFLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS \nKelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now holds the backpack. \nKELLY Buying and selling US service medals is illegal. \nBART Exactly. That's why the resale value is so high. \nKELLY Is that what they teach you at Langely? \nBART Don't be so na\u00efve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others. \nKELLY And I'm not even going to ask about the flask. \nBART Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets everything right, don't they? \nCAMPAIGN PIN STALL \nA frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of an extensive display of pins and buttons. \nWOMAN You boys look like Goldwater fans. \nKELLY I've never been accused of that before. \nWOMAN Well jeez, you don't have to be insulted. \nBART Anything military? \nThe woman considers this, her fan working back and forth lazily. \nWOMAN Fish around in that cigar box. \nBart paws through the box. Acts casual. \nBART What do you want for the box? \nWOMAN Twenty dollars. \nBART Fifteen. \nWOMAN Don't be so hasty. (fanning) I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins I'm looking to unload. \nFLEA MARKET FOOD COURT \nKelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market food and watch a slow-motion bingo game. \nKELLY Goldwater fan. I think that's some kind of insult. \nBART Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going to go to school? \nKELLY I'm not. \nBART Ah, you have that luxury. \nKELLY You don't? \nBART (shrugs) I didn't have much say in the matter. Everything has been decided for me since birth. I'm not whining about it. Play the hand you're dealt, right? \nKELLY Easy for you to say. You got a royal flush. \nBART Are you crazy? My life sucks. Everyone's always telling me what to do. You can't fight it. Go with the flow. \nThey eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT. \nKELLY What about Tabby? \nBART She got to go where she wanted. Sarah Lawrence. Six years. She's almost done with grad school. Yale. \nKELLY I didn't think people actually went to Yale. \nBART (thinking) I don't know. I mean, she drives off in her car in September. For all we know, she could just pull her car over in Albany and sleep there until May. \nKELLY What do you mean? \nBART It was a joke. Joke? \nBart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out. \nKELLY Oh. Is that what one of those sounds like? Somehow, I always imagined they would be funnier. \nBart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt. \n", "test2_true": "Bart shrugs. \nBART What happened to your face? \nKELLY Remember the backpack incident? \nBART Same guy? \nKELLY The one with mad cow-diseased hamburger meat for brains? That would be the one. \nInterested, Bart leans forward. \nBART What are you going to do about it? \nKELLY I'm not going to lower myself to his level. \nBART Of course not. But there are alternatives \nKELLY Alternatives? \nBART Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd Special Operations Wing? \nKelly shakes his head. \nBART Well do you want to get this guy or what? \nKELLY Yes. \nBART All right. Let's get the fuck out of here, then. \nBart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan. Kelly watches it hit the rim and go in. \nBART (on the move) I have some things to show you. \nINT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBart and Kelly sit amidst a spread of books, papers, and electronic equipment. \nBART Once we've gathered the intelligence, the plan will reveal itself. \nKELLY We don't plan first? \nBart opens a pad. \nBART No, it limits our scope - what's the objective? \nKELLY Humiliation. Rage. Despair. \nBART Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing. I have the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here somewhere. \nBart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages. \nTabby enters with an armful of art supplies. \nTABBY Hey. I have some stretcher bars out in the car. Can somebody help me bring them in? \nBART Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important. \nBart doesn't look up. He grabs another book. \nKELLY Sure. I mean, I'll help. \nBart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look. \nBART I'll find those reports. \nINT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT \nTabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps the bars and stands there looking around. \nAt the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet. \nPainting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash. \nKelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel. \nVery yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles. \nKELLY Gold. The color of the sun. \nTabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas. \nTABBY That's the Cleveland waterfront. \nKELLY As the viewer, I get to decide what it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't look a thing like it. \nTABBY It's the light. I was playing with diffusion. \nKELLY Well make sure you put it away when you're done with it. \n", "test3_input": "TABBY Just don't talk. \nKELLY Why would I? \nTABBY (pause) I'm kidding. \nKELLY Right. Irony. I like that. \nKelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color out. Looks over his shoulder at her. \nHe's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out how to play it. \nMINER (O.S.) Hey! Hey babe. \nMiner opens the door. See Kelly. Smiles like the stockbroker he is and crosses to him. \nMINER Miner Webber. \nMiner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake. \nKelly takes it. \nKELLY Webber Miner. \nMiner looks confused. \nTABBY Kelly. This is Kelly - \nKELLY Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I - \nMINER Quite all right. (smiles as an afterthought) So, what do we have here, a little painting class? \nTABBY Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints. \nMINER Oh? What's your real job? \nKelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas. \nKELLY That would be stock boy at the Shop Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky says, every employee is part owner. So you could say I'm a captain-of- industry in training. Kind of capitalist larva. \nMINER That's quite an image. \nKELLY Only if you see the most magical part. Do you see? \nMINER What? \nKelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little. \nKELLY One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. First I'll have to be a pupa though. I figure I won't be going out much then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world. \nMiner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making fun of, or if it might be him. \nMINER Whatever it takes to get you through the day. \nKelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls her to him. \nMINER I have the afternoon off. Come away with me. \nTABBY I'm not at a good stopping point. \nMINER Oh, come on. They'll still be here. (to Kelly) I know you'll still be here. \nKelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes. \nTABBY I really shouldn't. \nMINER But everyone will be coming soon. And it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves. \nTABBY We will. I promise. \nTabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her and sighs. \nMINER Like tonight? We can practice honeymoon suite. \nTABBY Maybe. Probably. \nMiner looks at Kelly, who looks away. \nThen he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves. \nTabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles, like he's copying what he thinks a painter would do. \nKELLY Is he always like that? \nTABBY Like what? \nKELLY Overbearing. \nTabby stops and puts down her brush. \n", "test3_true": "KELLY Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. Whether he wants to or not. \nKelly paints. \nKELLY Not that though. How he wanted you to stop. \nTABBY He wants to be with me. What's so bad about that? \nKELLY Just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you. \nKelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a hard time making eye contact with Tabby. \nKELLY No one should ever ask you to stop. If you stop, you might not be able to start again. Or you might start again, only things will be different. \nTABBY Well, that's sweet - \nKELLY It's not sweet, actually. It's just the truth. \nTABBY Hey, I can take care of myself. \nShe picks up her brush. \nKELLY When's the wedding? \nTABBY At the end of the month. But don't ask me about it. It makes me nervous. \nKelly looks at her seriously. \nKELLY Why? Is something wrong? \nTABBY No. \nAwkward silence. \nTABBY What are you painting? \nKelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode. \nKELLY Really, there are so many layers of - imagistic symbolism - that I really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well - it's a recurring dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket ship. \nTabby stops painting. \nTABBY How? \nKELLY What do you mean, \"how?\" Sidesaddle. She's riding it sidesaddle. She's got a fish tail, for chrissake. I haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not. \nTABBY Do you have any idea what you're talking about? \nKelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's gesture. \nKELLY Does that matter? \nTABBY Well, some people actually say what they really think. \nKELLY What if they don't know what they really think? \nTABBY It doesn't matter. It's called being yourself. \nKELLY Sounds boring. \nTABBY Not boring. Scary and wonderful and exciting. \nKelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off. \nKELLY Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop distracting me. \nINT. EVE'S STUDIO - NIGHT \nKelly comes in to return the art supplies. \nXiou-Xiou's alone working. She looks up and smiles at Kelly. \nKELLY Mom's got you working late? \nXIOU-XIOU No. \nKelly walks over and sees what she's working on. A beautiful spare Chinese landscape. \nKELLY Wow. You're really good. Why do you make those stupid animals for mom? \nXIOU-XIOU Each painting is a lesson. Here - \nShe gets out a piece of paper for him. \nKELLY I'm making a lot of art these days. I guess that means a lot of lessons. \nXIOU-XIOU Each line has a whole drawing contained in it. Each drawing has a whole life contained in it. \nKELLY Oh, that's all? \n"}

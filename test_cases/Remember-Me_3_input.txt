ALLY And... 
Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.    He's got the mangled Honey Bear. 
ALLY Dad... 
He goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved. 
AIDAN Tyler's not. 
She starts to close the door. 
AIDAN Wait. Shit. This isn't really my thing. 
ALLY He lied to me. 
AIDAN He's in love with you. 
ALLY He'd like to think he is. 
Aidan doesn't get it. 
AIDAN I don't know what that means...I've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you. She's a lot shorter and shares his DNA. 
Ally looks away. 
AIDAN You don't have to forgive him today... just forgive him. 
Craig reappears from the deep. 
CRAIG Thanks for stopping by. 
Father and daughter go back into the house. 
Aidan exhales. 
91   INT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- CAROLINE'S BEDROOM -- LATER      91 
Diane is on the house phone, preparing a tray of tea and cinnamon toast for Caroline as she talks. 
DIANE Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school?...Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap!... 
She slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and WE TRACK HIM down the hall to CAROLINE'S ROOM. Les is speaking on his cell phone. 
LES (sotto, into the phone) She's pretty traumatized. I wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone... 
92   INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM.                                     92 
Caroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed. Her head is nestled on his shoulder. She looks even tinier than usual. Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair. 
She looks pale, wasted. Her eyes are sunken and she's fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice. 
Les, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk... 
LES (on the phone) There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property. The school won't do anything. They'll probably get away with it... 
Tyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page as he hears this. 
93   INT. FOYER.                                                  93 
Diane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally. Aidan wraps his arms around Diane and gives her a hug. Ally hangs back a bit, unsure, then embraces Diane. 
Tyler emerges from the hallway. 
TYLER (to Diane) She's asleep. 
He sees Aidan and Ally. Stops short. 
94   EXT. FRONT STEPS -- LATER                                    94 
Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it behind her. 
TYLER Last one ever. I swear. 
ALLY I don't care. 
Beat. 
TYLER I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here. 
A silent moment passes. 
TYLER For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. 
ALLY It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie.

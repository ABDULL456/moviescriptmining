Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad fucking dream.  He's looking at them.  Liane is saying something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is still arrested by the statuesque bullet.  As they close on him... 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT 
And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.  We're at a crime scene.  Uniformed cops on horseback.  Just arrived, the Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll. 
LOWELL What happened? 
COP Dispatch received a call of shots fired in the area.  Uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject shot to death. 
LOWELL Was it gang related? 
COP There's no indication as far as a tag or an advertisement... 
Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone RINGS... 
LOWELL (answering) Excuse me.  Yeah... 
INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
WIGAND They're terrorizing us.  Death threats?! To my family?  My kids?! 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What are you talking about? 
WIGAND Someone put a bullet in my mailbox. 
LOWELL Jeff, call the FBI right away... 
WIGAND They do this with impunity! 
LOWELL Jeff... 
WIGAND They get to go home at night.  What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking about it. 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (frustrated) I heard you.  But I got to arrange a legal defense first.  I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record. 
WIGAND (cuts in) Then hold it off the air until you got that.  But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record.  Right now! 
LOWELL Good.  But Jeff... 
WIGAND I'll call them, Lowell. 
INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with Jeffrey in his living room... 
FBI AGENT #2 Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand? 
WIGAND Yes, I'm afraid I did. 
FBI AGENT #1 We won't be able to lift usable prints. 
FBI AGENT #2 Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand? 
WIGAND A gun?  Yes. 
FBI AGENT #2 What caliber is your gun? 
WIGAND What caliber is my gun? 
FBI AGENT #2 Yes, sir.  What caliber is your gun? 
WIGAND (a dawning realization) What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? 
Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her, takes her out of the room. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) (a beat, realizing) You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...? 
FBI AGENT #2 If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand... 
And he gets up...  They follow him into the bedroom.  He unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun, giving it to one of the Agents. 
FBI AGENT #1 Why do you keep this gun? 
WIGAND I don't think it's unconstitutional yet to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter. 
FBI AGENT #2 That bullet was for a .38 caliber.  Do you own a .38? 
WIGAND Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A .22 target pistol.  So what? 
FBI AGENT #2 (after a beat) Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

KARA Whatever happened to us, Brendan? 
BRENDAN Where's Dode flopped? 
She turns to face him. 
KARA We were a pair and a half for a few months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss having someone I can talk to. You ever miss having someone? I guess you must. 
Brendan's face is a mask. 
BRENDAN I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily. It's important. 
KARA (darkly) You better be sure you wanna know whatcha wanna know. 
Brendan stands, coughing. 
BRENDAN Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the 
sense to get out from under you before he gets hurt. 
KARA You didn't, did you? 
Brendan leaves without looking back. 
INT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Brendan's at his desk, on the phone. 
THE BRAIN (on the phone) So what happens now? 
BRENDAN Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless his crew spotted VP Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us 70/30. If we're in I get under his skin and see what's what. You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura. 
The Brain is quiet for a beat. 
THE BRAIN I think she's with us, Brendan. 
BRENDAN (too sharp) I'll let you know when she is. 
A beat of silence. 
THE BRAIN Okay. 
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence. 
EXT. LOCKER CAGE - MORNING 
The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is folded into a star. He pulls it open. "TWELVE THIRTY PICO & ALEXANDER". He fishes the old note out and compares them - different handwriting. 
The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the notes. 
A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's. 
BRENDAN You the Pin's? 
No answer. The lug keeps coming. 
BRENDAN (cont'd) So what's his answer? 
Closer, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist. Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw. 
Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso. Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is running. 
EXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY 
Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows. 
EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him. 
Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right. Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach. 
Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner. 
Brendan drops to a sitting position. 
THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER

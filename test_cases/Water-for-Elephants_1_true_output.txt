MARLENA (CONT'D) Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas...I must have covered a dozen states by the time I was 17. I'd make up stories about who my parents were... 
(LAUGHS) When I was five, I pretended for a whole year my mother was an Appaloosa mare... They both laugh. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) I did! ... and I pretended that I was really an Appaloosa filly...and that I was just dreaming I was a girl and one day, I'd wake up...and I'd run home. 
(LAUGHS) Anyway, I was a lot safer inside those stables than I ever was inside those homes... Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new route for her conversation. 
JACOB What happened at 17? 
MARLENA There was a parade for the circus. At the head, there were six black Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red tassles. So proud! So beautiful. And August was leading them. The second he looked at me, the way he looked at me, I knew I'd never live with strangers again. And the way he talked. Told me "I'd find a home in every city..welcomed in every town...and he'd give me-- 
JACOB/MARLENA -- a life most suckers can't dream of"! 
MARLENA 
(LAUGHS) Ha, you too, huh? 
(JACOB NODS) It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?

MARLENA (CONT'D) But he said he'd make me a Star Attraction and he did. I'm pretty lucky he found me. Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out: 
JACOB He was pretty lucky to find you. Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared. 
MARLENA You're sweet to say so. Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject: 
JACOB Pretty song. 
MARLENA Don't tell him what happened... Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them. 
JACOB Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell. Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him; 
MARLENA That's the name of the song. "Don't Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth Etting. She's one of my favorites. Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him; 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Are you much of a wine drinker? 
JACOB I have no idea. 
MARLENA Maybe you should go to bed. 
JACOB 
(NODS) Where's that? Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it; 
MARLENA Here, let me...We can't let you go out there all untied. A circus is a small town. What will people say? As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek... 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Sweet, sweet Jacob... 
JACOB 
(SENSITIVE ISSUE) I'm not that sweet. 
MARLENA (Lowers her hand) Good night. Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob stands still for a moment, then exits.

Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman. 
Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves. 
All eyes on him as he starts across... 
20   EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                                              20 
The Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it, he takes a last look around. Continues across to... 
21   EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY                                          21 
The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket. 
Stooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket. 
22   EXT. THICKET - DAY                                              22 
Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Why are you stopping? 
THE POSTMAN I found him. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) He alive? 
Clearly he is not. 
THE POSTMAN Yeah. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Bring him out. 
The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising, steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward. 
ARMY 
Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back. 
ON BRIDGE 
The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank. 
IDAHO (across river) Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag! 
The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK. CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down, disappear in the river below. 
The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water. 
Then The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and the current, he's being quickly swept away from the Holnists. 
As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury. 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 
A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he disappears around a bend in the river. 
Bethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend. 
Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving with military precision. 
Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody. 
BETHLEHEM In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. 
Woody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous excitement. 
CONSCRIPTS Go!   Go! 
BANDIT #20 (caught up) I'll get him, sir. 
He takes off running across the bridge. 
23   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                               23 
A fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear. 
They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself out. They start after him. 
24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24 
Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past. 
Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the trees. They look at each other for a moment. 
THE POSTMAN Just let me go. I don't want to be part of your army. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                    24 
Bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a grin. 
BANDIT #20 My army.   I like the sound of that. 
The Postman gestures with his knife. 
THE POSTMAN Don't -- 
BANDIT #20 I got him!   Over -- 
The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut.   He blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground. 
The Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him. It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear others approaching from the river. 
WOODY They sent me to kill you. 
THE POSTMAN Come with me.

DEBBIE I don't like Mexico. 
51   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
They drive down the highway and then turn onto a path. They drive down the path at high speed, lifting up clouds of dust. 
52   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- DAY 
They arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert; a few houses, no more than twenty, some adorned with multicolored paper. 
Several crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift shed built out of yucca fronds. A group of musicians who play Norteña music are setting up their instruments. 
There are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked around the hamlet. The guests are wearing their best: fresh shirts, big buckles, almost new boots. 
Santiago parks. Amelia gets out first.     A group of people sees her and comes over to greet her. 
COMADRE 1 (All in Spanish) Hey, so you finally made it. 
Amelia smiles.   Her friends notices Mike and Debbie. 
COMADRE 1 (CONT'D) You brought them? 
Amelia nods. Luis (24), Amelia's son, a typical Norteño cowboy with long sideburns and moustache, his face tanned from days under the sun, wearing a pistachio-colored tuxedo with a cloth flower in the lapel, greets Amelia with a kiss. 
LUIS Hi mom, how're you doing? 
She looks him up and down. 
AMELIA Son, you look like Pedro Infante. 
COMADRE 1 More like Luis Miguel. 
AMELIA Where's the bride? 
LUIS She's not here yet. 
AMELIA What d'you mean she's not here yet? 
LUIS Well, she ain't here. 
Mike and Debbie, struck dumb by the language and the strangers, hide behind Amelia, who introduces them to Luis. 
AMELIA Look son, these are Mike and Debbie, the kids I take care of. 
Luis holds his hand out ceremoniously. 
LUIS Pleased to meet you Mike. 
Santiago calls out to some kids who are running around. 
SANTIAGO Psst.   Lucio, come here. 
Lucio (10), the oldest of the gang, approaches.   Santiago gestures toward the two American kids. 
SANTIAGO (CONT'D) These are Mike and Debbie. Keep an eye on them for me. 
Lucio gives them a scornful glance and calls them over half- heartedly. 
LUCIO Come with me. 
With her hand, Amelia signals to the kids that it's ok to go with him. Shyly, Debbie and Mike follow. 
53   INT. ROOM, HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- DAY 
Amelia is in a room with her two daughters standing in front of a peeling and broken mirror putting on her violet gown. One of her daughters helps her and pulls the zipper all the way up. 
DAUGHTER 1 (All in Spanish) Oh ma, I don't know how you did it but it zipped up perfectly. 
AMELIA And it's been 15 years since I last wore this dress. 
DAUGHTER 1 You haven't changed a bit, ma. 
AMELIA Working, dear, working, that's what keeps one young. 
The two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below the seat, exchange looks and smile, which doesn't please Amelia. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) What are you guys laughing about? 
DAUGHTER 2 Nothing ma, nothing. 
Amelia looks at them suspiciously, turns around and leaves the room with her dress elegantly torn. 
54   EXT. DESERT ROAD, MOROCCO -- DAY 
The bus is in the middle of the road. 
Several of the tourists are hiding under their seats, frightened. The driver, still ducking, looks toward the mountains to try to piece together what happened. 
Richard holds Susan against his shoulder, blood gushing from her neck. Her eyes are open and staring at a fading world. 
Richard takes Susan from under her armpits and carefully lays her down on the aisle. Anwar runs over to help. 
RICHARD Take it easy honey, take it easy. 
Anwar takes his shirt off - left only in his undershirt - and puts it under Susan's neck. 
SUSAN (mumbling senselessly) I'm ok... I'm ok... 
Susan breathes in, and every time she does, blood flows from her wound. Richard turns toward the other passengers. 
RICHARD Is anybody a doctor? 
Nobody answers.   Richard starts to lose his cool. 
RICHARD (CONT'D) Please: a doctor.

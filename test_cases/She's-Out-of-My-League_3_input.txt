MOLLY A three what?   What are you talking about!? 
KIRK Look! What the hell is going on here!? What are you up to!? 
MOLLY What am I up to!?    Good God! 
KIRK Please, tell me you're a terrorist! Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt! Just tell me something that makes sense because all you're doing is driving me nuts! 
MOLLY (hurt and resigned) The only thing I'm going to tell you is that I'd like you to leave. 
KIRK Fine! I'm going! Webbed feet!? Are you fucking kidding me!? 
Kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door.    Molly slumps onto her bed and cries as the door slams. 
INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY 
Kirk is at his post looking terribly sad. Stainer is working at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend. 
Fuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is coming through. Habib sees this and takes his bag straight to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk. Kirk doesn't look inside. 
KIRK Go on, Habib. You're good. 
HABIB Really!?   Great! 
Habib steps off to his gate.   Fuller gets in Kirk's face. 
FULLER You think you're pretty smart don't you Kettner. Thin ice mister! 
Kirk stomps away from the checkpoint. 
FULLER (CONT'D) Good! Don't come back, Kettner! America is safer without you! 
Stainer goes after Kirk. 
EXT. AIRPORT CURB 
Kirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace. 
STAINER Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you doing!? You can't let her screw up your life! 
KIRK Get away from me Stainer! 
STAINER Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We both knew this Molly thing wasn't going to work out! It ain't my fault! 
KIRK You're right. It's not your fault. It's my fault for listening to all your... pernicious advice. 
STAINER What the fuck you talkin' about? 
KIRK All you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how I'm not worthy. 
STAINER Are you worthy of a chick like that? 
KIRK Maybe! I don't know. But that's not the point! You're supposed to be my God damned best friend. You know what!? (MORE) 
KIRK (CONT'D) I think you were jealous and you set out to sabotage us from the start! 
STAINER That is total bullshit! 
KIRK Then why weren't you there for me? What if she actually liked me!? Maybe with a little help, I could have pulled it off! 
Kirk steps onto an... 
INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS 
Willy (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever. A few others are seated on the bus. Stainer follows Kirk on board. They remain standing, holding onto poles. 
WILLY It is Kirk and his crazy friend Stinker and they are most upset! 
Willy steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and Stainer around as they argue. 
STAINER Kirk, she was going to hurt you. 
KIRK Look at me! I'm hurt now! 
Willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like... 
WILLY He's hurting now!

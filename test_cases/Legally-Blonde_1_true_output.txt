BROOKE 
(completely shamed) I ' m a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ' d lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation! 
Elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her. 
ELLE 
Your secret is safe with me. 
95   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LIBRARY - DAY            95 
The associates and interns sit at a table piled high with research, as Donovan goes over his notes. 
DONOVAN 
..              We've got two interviews tomorrow that Dick and Bobby are gonna handle, and the ex-wife in an hour. He looks up. 
DONOVAN (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Sarah, can you grab me some coffee? 
Sarah rises, and fetches the coffee from the side table. 
DONOVAN (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And according to this communique from the prison, our client apparently had a visit fr om her sister? A Miss Delta Gamma -- He looks at Elle. 
DONOVAN (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Anyone you know? 
Elle looks up, caught.   The others looks at her. 
ELLE 
I went to get her alibi. 
Emmett looks over, surprised. 
(CONTINUED) 
DONOVAN 
Did you get it? 
ELLE 
But I can't tell you what it is. Yes. 
The others can't believe this. 
DONOVAN 
Why the hell not? 
' ELLE 
I promised her I ' d keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! 
Now he's pissed. 
DONOVAN 
Fuck sisterhood. This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi. 
Sarah sets Donovan's coffee down.     Watching to see what Elle will do. 
ELLE 
I can't give it to you. All I can tell you is that she's innocent. 
An ASSISTANT pokes her head in the room. 
ASSISTANT 
Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two. 
Donovan rises, still annoyed. 
DONOVAN 
Someone reason with her while I take this. 
He walks out.     The others look at Elle. 
BOBBY 
Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi. 
ELLE 
, No! 
DICK 
We're gonna lose the case if you don't. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Then we're not very good lawyers. 
Emmett hides a smile.     Warner leans over to Elle.   Sarah is nearby, listening. Â· 
WARNER 
(quietly) If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares.about Brooke? Think about yourself. 
ELLE 
I gave her my word, Warner. 
Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different light. 
Donovan storms back in. 
DONOVAN 
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires. 
GERARD 
A spa? (to Elle) Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship? Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan. 
ELLE                 . 
I can go if you want.

A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb. Rodin wished for it to serve as his headstone and epitaph. CONTD: \nPAUL That would be in Meudon. He died of the flu if I'm not mistaken - 1917 I believe. GUIDE Exactly correct. You know your art history, monsieur. The design - PAUL (cutting her off) The Thinker is so powerful because he thinks not just with his brain - he thinks with every limb and muscle - you feel the concentration. INEZ (to Gil) He's so knowledgeable, isn't he? \nPAUL So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille. GUIDE Yes, she was an influence - though Camille was not the wife but his mistress. PAUL Camille?      No. GUIDE Yes.      Rose was the wife. PAUL He never married Rose. GUIDE Yes, in the last year of their lives. PAUL I think you're mistaken. CAROL Are you arguing with the guide? PAUL am. I 13   CONTD: (2)                                                      13 \nGUIDE Ah, non, non, je suis certaine. \nGIL I'm afraid she's right. I just read the recent two volume biography of Rodin - Rose was definitely the wife, Camille the mistress. PAUL You read that? Where did you read that? GIL I did - no question.    Camille- Rose. INEZ Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight. CAROL It'll be so fun. Paul's an expert on French wines. INEZ (walking with Gil) When did you read the biography of Rodin?

INEZ (tasting) I can't tell the difference. They're both delicious. JOHN Take it easy Inez.     Those little sips add up. CONTD: \nHELEN You should talk, John - especially for someone who once advocated the boycott of french wines. JOHN I'll always take a California wine but the Napa Valley is six thousand miles away. They laugh and drink. INEZ (to Gil) Which do you prefer? GIL To me they're all great.   What the hell do I know? INEZ I don't think I've ever seen your cheeks so red. GIL Pheromones, it's your pheromones. Paul and Carol have ambled over, having heard Gil's last amorous remark. PAUL Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels the desire but kills the performance - according to the Bard. CAROL Have you tasted the '61? It's divine - though Paul found it - what? PAUL Slightly more tannic than the '59. I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling, don't you agree? GIL You will admit she's a sexy woman. PAUL This I have known for many years. You're a very lucky man. (toast) (MORE) CONTD: (2) PAUL (cont' d) May you make the transition from movies to literature and may your book glorify all the Shirley Temple dolls and Charlie Chaplin wristwatches that make us nostalgic for an allegedly once simpler, more charming world.

CAROL If Gil doesn't want to go, I'll share Paul with you. I'm very democratic. And he's a marvelous dancer. GIL If it's okay with you, I'd really just like a little walk and go to bed. We can do it another night. INEZ Well I can go, right? GIL You go? CaNTO: \nINEZ I'm not tired and I'm dying to dance. I'll just meet you back at the hotel. PAUL I'll take good care of her.

CAROL Back home we just joined a marvelous tennis club and Paul says you play. Does Gil? INEZ I can't introduce him to tennis - Daddy's having the damndest time pressuring him to learn golf. PAUL Is he a good writer?     Have you read his prose? INEZ He won't let anybody - PAUL If he wants I'd be glad to go over his novel and critique it for him. INEZ That's what he needs, to have it read by someone who really knows and wouldn't pull any punches. The problem is - when it comes to his writing he has no respect for anyone's opinion.

You're a writer - you need time to write - not all this playing around - she's wasting you - because she's really a competitor - don't you agree? GIL Me?   I just met - HEMINGWAY Speak up for Christ's sake. I'm asking you if you think my friend is making a tragic mistake. GIL Actually I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well - HEMINGWAY You're a writer - you make observations - you were with them all night. SCOTT Can we not discuss my personal life in public? CONTD: (4) \nHEMINGWAY She has him on yachts, at parties, jumping into swimming pools you're wasting your talent. SCOTT You don't understand her. HEMINGWAY (to Gil) She's jealous of his gift and it's a damn fine gift. It's rare. You like his work? You can speak freely. SCOTT Stop it. HEMINGWAY You like Mark Twain? GIL I do - very much. SCOTT I'm going to find Zelda. I don't like the thought of her with the Spaniard. (stumbles out) HEMINGWAY He's a fine writer, Fitzgerald. You box? GIL No. HEMINGWAY What are you writing? GIL A novel. HEMINGWAY About what? GIL A man who works in a nostalgia shop. HEMINGWAY What the hell's a nostalgia shop? CONTD: (5) \nGIL Where they sell old things - memorabilia. Does that sound terrible to you? HEMINGWAY No subject is terrible if the story is true. If the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.

GIL It's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me your opinion. HEMINGWAY My opinion is I hate it. GIL You do? HEMINGWAY If it's bad I'll hate it because I hate bad writing and if it's good I'll be envious and hate it all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer. GIL But there's no one I really trust to evaluate it - HEMINGWAY Writers are competitive. GIL I could never compete with you - CONTD: (6) \nHEMINGWAY You're too self-effacing - it's not manly. If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer - but you're not the best as long as I'm around. Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it. GIL No - no - that's okay - HEMINGWAY I won't read your novel but I'll tell you what I'll do. GIL Yes? HEMINGWAY I'll bring it over to Gertrude Stein. She's the only one I trust to read my work. No one discovers new talent like Gert - whether it's poetry, painting, music - She'll tell you if you have a book or not. GIL You could have Gertrude Stein read my novel? HEMINGWAY Give it to me. GIL I have to get it.   It's at the hotel. HEMINGWAY She gets back from Spain tomorrow. GIL (rises) I'm so thrilled - my heart is beating.

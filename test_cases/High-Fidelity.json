{"train": "HIGH FIDELITY \nBy \nD.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink, & John Cusack \nBased on the novel by Nick Hornby \nLondon Draft Registered: WGAw \nFADE IN \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSTEREO \nNot a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush. \nROB (V.O.) What came first?  The music or the misery?  People worry about kids playing with guns and watching violent videos, we're scared that some sort of culture of violence is taking them over... \nRECORDS \nBig thin LPs.  Fields of them.  We move across them, slowly... they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes... \nROB (V.O.) But nobody worries about kids listening to thousands -- literally thousands -- of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss. \nIt seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until... we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you.  He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him. \nROB Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listened to pop music? \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nGroup of bags huddled next to the door.  Not the go-on- \nvacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out variety.  Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones.  We hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time. \nLAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off.  She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence.  She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.  Laura begins to cry a bit. \nLAURA I don't really know what I'm doing. \nHe smiles, and she doesn't.  He adjusts. \nROB You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever. \nLAURA We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know... \nROB Well stay for tonight, then. \nLaura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door.  A strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind Rob.  He stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of Laura and her dragging bags. \nSTEREO \nRob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal.  He addresses us again. \nROB My desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable break-ups, in chronological order are as follows: Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick, Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson, Sarah Kendrew. \nINT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL \nLaura drags her bags, banging down the stairs -- \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT \nRob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, looking for change as he continues. \nROB Those were the ones that really hurt. Can you see your name in that list, Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten, but there's no place for you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that you're just not capable of delivering. \nHe adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer. \nROB That probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable. Unhappiness used to mean something. Now it's just a drag like a cold or having no money. \nHe moves through the living room to an open window facing the street.  Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street. \nROB If you really wanted to mess me up, you should have got to me earlier. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN PARK - DUSK - \nRob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly. \nROB (V.O.) Which brings us to number one.  Alison Ashworth. \nPARK BENCH - DUSK \nROB The fetish properties are not unlike porn.  I would feel guilty taking their money if I wasn't, kind of, well, one of them. \nAs he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and \nreplaces it almost the same position, but not quite -- meticulousness and pride in this gesture... \nAfter a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo. \nROB 'Morning, Dick. \nDICK Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob. \nROB Good weekend? \nDICK Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only. \nROB Great. \nDICK I'll tape it for you. \nROB No, that's okay.  Really. \nDICK 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though. \nROB Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one. \nDICK Well, I'll just make it for you. \nROB (resigned) Okay. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RECORD STORE - LATER \nDick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory. \nROB (re: music) What's this? \nDICK The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it? \nThe door flies open and BARRY, an acid-tongued post-punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in.  His teeth are clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically cranking a Clash riff: \nBARRY BAA!  BA BA DANG! \nDick shrinks back from him instinctively.  He stops mid-step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store.  His face adopts an exaggerated grimace. \nBARRY Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this? \nDICK It's the new -- \nROB It's the record we've been listening to and enjoying, Barry. \nBarry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick gets out of his way. \nBARRY Well that's problematic because it sucks ass. \nHe pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick. \nBARRY (re: the CD) Yours, I assume... \nBarry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in.  \"How to Kill a Radio Consultant\" by Public Enemy comes through at through the red levels. \nROB (over the blare) TURN IT OFF, BARRY. \nBARRY IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER. \nBarry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears. \nRob goes behind the counter and stops the tape.  Barry's head pops out of the stockroom. \nBARRY What are you doing? \nROB I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now. \nBARRY Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care. \nROB I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore. \nBARRY But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today. \nROB Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier. \nBARRY Don't you want to hear what's next? \nRob relaxes and goes back to work. \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) Great.  Can I have it then? \nBARRY (O.S.) No, you can't. \nRob deflates, shaking his head. \nSTORE FLOOR \nBarry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the CUSTOMER, a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat. \nCUSTOMER Why not? \nBARRY Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells \"I Just Called To Say I Loved You?\" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. \nCUSTOMER What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you -- \nBARRY Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? \nThe Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store. \nCUSTOMER Okay, okay, buddy.  I didn't know it was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square Guy Day.  My apologies.  I'll be on my way. \nHe steps out of the door. \nBARRY B'Bye! \nOutside, anger catches up to the Customer.  He turns and throws up a middle finger -- \nCUSTOMER FUCK YOU! \n-- and bolts.  Barry smiles and turns to see \nROB \nstanding in the doorway of the stock room.  He feigns applause. \nROB Nice, Barry. \nBARRY Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  \"Is it better to burn out than to fade away?\" \nROB You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry. \nBARRY We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is \"Don't Drive Drunk.\" I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny. \nROB Not the point. \nBARRY Oh, so what's the point then? \nROB I don't want you talking to our customers like that again. \nBARRY \"Our customers?\" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular? \nRob's face begins to redden with anger. \nROB Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop. \nBARRY Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal. \nROB What did he ever do to you? \nBARRY He offended me with his terrible taste. \nROB It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's. \nBARRY Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. (sarcastic) You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club? \nRob is red and seething. \nBARRY And by the way, I tell you this for your own good: That's the worst sweater I've ever seen.  I have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone I'm on speaking terms with.  It's a disgrace to the human race. \nRob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall.  Rob is so mad he can't say anything. \nDICK Hey, guys... Hey. \nRob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast. \nBARRY (extremely shaken) What are you, some kind of fucking maniac?  If this jacket's torn you're gonna pay big. \nBarry stomps out of the store.  Rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder.  Dick appears in the doorway, terrified. \nDICK Are you all right? \nINT. SOME RECORD STORE - DAY \nA younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a stack of records. \nROB (V.O.) I came to three months later, and to my surprise had flunked out of school and started working in a record store. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob stands in front of his wall of music, shifting LPs around between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to us. \nROB What I really learned from the Charlie Debacle is that you gotta punch your weight.  Charlie was out of my Class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much.  What am I?  Average.  A middleweight.  Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest.  I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right? -- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much.  My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut.  I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films.  Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining. I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame.  You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen. Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs.  I don't do any of these things, really.  If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have... So.  Charlie and I didn't match. After her I was determined to never get out of my league again. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob presses play on the answering machine.  A pleasant, older female voice is heard.  It's JANET, Laura's mother. \nJANET (on machine) Hello, you two.  Laura, it's your mother.  Your father's angina is a little rough today and I thought he'd like to talk to you.  No big deal.  I love you two.  Bye. \nBeep. \nLIZ (on machine) Rob, it's Liz.  Just calling to see, well, if you're okay.  Give me a ring.  I'm not taking sides.  Yet. Lot's of love.  Bye. \nHe pulls an LP from a shelf, puts it on the turntable and sits back in his chair. \nEXT. LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT - MOS - THE PAST \nThe MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes.  Rob and SARAH, a thin, modestly attractive young woman, SARAH, walk and talk.  They seem to be emphatically complaining together. \nROB (V.O.) Charlie and I didn't match.  Marco and Charlie matched.  Me and Sarah, number four on the all time break- ups list, matched.  She wore more or less the same clothes as mine, had an acceptable working knowledge of music, and she had been dumped by some asshole named Michael.  He was her moment, Charlie was mine.  Sarah had sworn off men.  I had sworn off women.  It made sense to pool our loathing of the opposite sex, swear them off together, and get to share a bed with someone at the same time. \nINT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - MOS - NIGHT \nRob and SARAH sit up in bed, staring at the television... \nROB (V.O.) We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives. Only people of a certain disposition are frightened of being alone for the rest of their lives at twenty- six.  We were of that disposition. Everything seemed much later than it was. \nINT. SARAH'S KITCHEN - MOS - DAY ROB'S POV \nof Sarah, sitting across the table, mid-confession. \nROB (V.O.) When she told me that she met someone else it made no sense.  Her meeting someone else was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement. All we really had in common was that we were dumped by people, and that we were against dumping.  We were violently anti-dump.  So how come I got dumped? \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nThe MUSIC becomes PRESENCE again, and Rob takes the needle off the record. \nROB You run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with. But I didn't know that at the time. All I saw was that I'd moved down a division and that it still hadn't worked out, and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self- pity.  And that's when Laura came along. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor.  He looks to camera. \nROB I'm reorganizing my records tonight. It's something I do in times of emotional distress.  When Laura was here I had them in alphabetical order, before that, chronologically. Tonight, though, I'm trying to put them in the order in which I bought them.  That way I can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen.  Pull them all off the shelves, look for Revolver and go from there. I'll be able to see how I got from Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty- five moves.  What I really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than I am.  To find anything you have to be me, or at the very least a doctor in Rob-ology. If you wanna find Landslide by Fleetwood Mac you have to know that I bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 and then didn't give it to them for personal reasons.  But you don't know any of that, do you?  You would have to ask me to-- \nThe phone rings again.  Rob picks it up. \nROB Yeah? \nMOM Hi, Rob.  It's your mother. \nRob deflates a bit. \nROB Hi, Mom. \nMOM Everything all right? \nROB Great.  Super-fantastic. \nMOM How's the store? \nROB So so.  Up and down. \nMOM Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep... \nRob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but succumbs -- \nROB She left.  She's gone. \nMOM What do you mean?  Where did she go? \nROB How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out. \nMOM Well call her mother. \nBARRY We can take your car. \nROB It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great. \nBarry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door. \nBARRY Jaggoff... \nBarry exits.  Rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet. \nROB Who the fuck is Ian?! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROB'S BUILDING'S LOBBY - NIGHT \nRob enters and walks to the mail table, looking like shit. \nHe starts sifting through envelopes for his. \nROB Laura doesn't know anybody called Ian.  There's no Ian at her office. She has no friends named Ian.  She has never met anyone called Ian in her whole life.  Although there may have been one in college -- but I am almost certain that since 1989 she has lived in an Ian-less universe. \nHe slows... and stops.  His face gets a little paler as he lifts a letter up to his face. \nCLOSE-UP: LETTER \nA cable service bill to a Mr. I. Raymond. \nROB \nas he looks at it, divining. \nROB \"I. Raymond.\" Ray. \"I.\" IAN. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Mr. I Raymond. \"Ray\" to his friends, and, more importantly, to his neighbors.  The guy who up until about six weeks ago lived upstairs. I knew it was him the moment I saw the letter.  I start to remember things now: His stupid clothing, his music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever fucking world music was trendy that week--stupid laugh, awful cooking smells.  I can't remember anything good about him at all.  I never liked him much then, and I fucking hate him now... I manage to block out the worst, most painful, most disturbing memory of him until I go to bed. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nDarkness.  We move silently through the rooms, and enter the bedroom... closer to the bed, we see Rob on his back, sheets held clenched up to his chin.  He stares at the ceiling, sadly. \nJUMP CUT \nTo almost the same shot, but it's Rob and Laura in the bed, semi-tangled.  Laura has a book in her lap.  A CREAKING is heard.  Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at attention.  They look up at the light fixture, which shakes a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking.  Someone is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for it. \nROB Jeez.  He goes on long enough. \nLAURA I should be so lucky. \nThey turn to each other and laugh. \nJUMP CUT BACK \nto Rob lying still in bed, staring at the ceiling. \nROB You are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura. You are Ian's plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight.  No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian in my head. \nROB'S IAN-LAURA SEX NIGHTMARE - QUICK CUTS \nIan mercilessly savages Laura from behind, below, and above, champagne showers, toe-sucking, and animal screams -- \nBACK TO ROB IN BED, \nimploding with disgust and sorrow.  Tears run down his cheeks into his ears. \nROB Number five -- Jackie Allen.  My break up with Jackie Allen had no effect on my life whatsoever.  I just slotted her in to bump you out of position, Laura.  Yes, you do in fact make it into the top five. Welcome.  And just to remind you, the list is in chronological order, not in the order of pain and suffering. \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nDick and Barry are stocking the racks.  Rob stands at the register, rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot, to \"Always and Forever\" by the Commodores.  He is a mess. \nFEMALE VOICE Hey. \nRob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty-year-old GIRL standing in front of him. \nGIRL Do you have soul? \nRob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning in mind. \nWOMAN Sure.  Ten cents. \nROB Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care. \nWOMAN Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY \nRob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down the street talking to camera. \nROB How come I end up siding with the bad guy, the man who ran off to Jamaica with some nymphette?  I just got left for someone else, so why can't I bring myself to feel whatever it is his wife is feeling?  All I can see is that guy's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records, and I can't help but feel desperately, painfully sorry for him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT \nThe bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths and a stage for jazz.  Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring a drink with his finger.  After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear. \nHeavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him. \nLIZ MOTHERFUCKER. \nShe is enormous, and she is mad as hell.  Rob reflexively shrinks. \nROB What's the -- hey, Liz -- \nLIZ -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE. \nShe turns and stomps toward the door.  Rob gets up and follows. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nRob comes out of the club and follows Liz.  She hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest. \nLIZ To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that! \nROB It's true! \nLIZ Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were \"kind of looking around for somebody else!\" \nROB Well she -- \nShe turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street. \nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT \nRob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train. \nHe stares at an OLD COUPLE who do not speak to each other. \nROB She's right, of course.  I am a fucking asshole.  I did and said those things.  But before you judge, although you've probably already done so, go off for a minute and write down the top five worst things that you have done to your partner, even if -- especially if -- your partner doesn't know about them. Don't dress things up or try to explain them.  Just write them down in the plainest language possible... \nA LONG BEAT, even five or ten seconds. \nROB Pencils down.  Okay, so who's the asshole now? \nCUT TO: \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nSaturday.  For the first time we see the place kind of busy. Rob watches the room.  Barry is toward the back, talking to a CUSTOMER. \"Cruel to Be Kind\" by Nick Lowe plays. \nBARRY It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- \nCUSTOMER I have all of the others. \nBARRY Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain? \nCUSTOMER They always seemed... \nBARRY They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane. \nHe plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame. \nCUSTOMER Well what about the new Echo -- \nBARRY Do not get ahead of yourself. \nDICK \nis listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice. \nROB Dick, call the police, please. \nVince and Justin look at each other. \nROB (looking through the CD's) Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now? \nVINCE Naw.  Those are for us. \nROB Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now? \nJUSTIN You're, like, so bigoted to look at us and, like, think you know what we listen to. \nVINCE You got the CD's so can I have my board back? \nROB I think you have more. \nVINCE Well we don't. \nROB I can't frisk you but the cops can. \nJustin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, \"How To Make A Record.\"  He tosses it over. \nROB Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free. \nVINCE No, we... \nJUSTIN We don't know how it works.  Nobody even knows, so we wanted to check it out in that mag. \nRob snorts. \nJUSTIN Like, do you know how to actually make a CD? \nRob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the underappreciated expert. \nROB Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the \"mothers,\" as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it. \nVINCE Records are those big round black things, right? \nROB Fuck off. \nRob turns to go back in the store. \nVINCE Hey, can I have my board? \nRob drops it and enters the store. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT - QUICK CUTS: \nBarry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of beer as the last customer goes out the door... The three lean against the bins, tired and smiling. \nBARRY (to Rob) What? \nROB What do you mean, \"what?\" \nBARRY What are you snickering about? \nROB I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy. \nBARRY What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about? \nDICK Well we rang $900 today. \nROB Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage. \nDick and Barry look at each other.  They almost know how to take a compliment. \nEXT. RECORD STORE - NIGHT \nRob, now alone, turns the sign from \"open\" to \"closed\" shuts the door behind him, and pulls the gate across.  Laura appears from the next doorway.  He jumps. \nROB Shit! \nLAURA Hi. \nROB Hi. \nLAURA I thought I could give you a lift back. \nROB Are you coming home? \nLAURA Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things. \nLAURA Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet? \nROB Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection? \nShe begins putting books and other things into the bag... \nLAURA You bet.  I've been saying that for years. \nHaving no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground. \nROB So.  Where have you been staying for the last week? \nLAURA I think you know that. \nROB Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I? \nLaura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away. \nLAURA I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know. \nROB Good. (beat) So.  Is it my job? \nLAURA What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob. \nROB I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of. \nLAURA What were the others? \nROB Just the obvious stuff. \nLAURA What's the obvious stuff? \nROB I don't know. \nShe stands and walks toward the bathroom. \nLAURA I guess it's not that obvious, then. \nROB No. \nAs soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera. \nROB And number three: The Pregnancy.  I didn't know she was pregnant.  Of course I didn't.  She hadn't told me because I had told her I was... sort of... seeing somebody else.  We thought we were being very grown-up, but we were being preposterously naive, childish even, to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to it while we were living together.  So -- I didn't find out about it 'til way later.  We were going through a good period and I made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears.  I made her tell me what it was all about, and she did.  I felt guilty and so I got angry.  She told me that at the time I didn't look like a very good long- term bet.  That it was a hard decision and she didn't see any point in consulting me about it...  When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big -- \nWe hear the bathroom door open. \nLAURA (O.S.) What? \nROB (covering) What, what? \nLaura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door. \nLAURA Did you say something? \nROB No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian? \nLAURA Rob.  Don't be childish. \nROB Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going. \nLAURA I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing. \nROB Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead? \nLaura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag.  Rob turns back to camera. \nROB -- When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other. \nLaura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes to the book shelves next to the records.  She starts topping off the bag with books. \nLAURA Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here. \nROB So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together? \nLAURA I don't know. \nROB Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility. \nLAURA I suppose so. \nROB So we have a chance of getting back together again. \nLAURA Oh, Rob, shut up. \nBARRY Rob!  What about the Beatles?  What about the fucking Rolling Stones? What about fucking... fucking... Beethoven?  Track one side one of the Fifth Symphony?  You shouldn't be allowed to run a record shop. You shouldn't be allowed to -- \nSFX: BARRY'S VOICE FADES OUT.  Rob's mouth slacks and he stares off. \nROB (V.O.) There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does \"yet\" mean, anyway?  \"I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet.\" What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it? \nSFX: BACK TO THE ROOM. \nBARRY -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- \nROB -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean? \nBarry just looks at Rob.  He pulls out a Game Boy and begins playing. \nROB Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?\" \nBARRY To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century. \nROB Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" what would you think? \nBarry shuts off the Game Boy. \nBARRY I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you. \nROB No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it? \nBARRY I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say? \nROB Just listen to me.  If I said to you -- \nBARRY \"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" yeah, yeah, I hear you -- \nROB Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it? \nBARRY Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone... \nRob brightens.  Barry finally considers. \nBARRY ...But the word \"yet...\" Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. \nROB But in your opinion, would I definitely go? \nBARRY How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. \nRob darkens. \nROB Why would they care? \nBARRY Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass. \nThey look at each other for a strange moment. \nBARRY I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now? \nROB Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours. \nBarry stands. \nBARRY Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock. \nROB Ha. \nDICK I can't go to the club tonight, guys. \nBARRY Why? \nDick smiles sheepishly. \nBARRY Who are you going to see? \nDICK Nobody. \nBarry's eyes widen. \nBARRY Rob, looky looky.  Dick!  Are you getting some?! \nSilence. \nBARRY Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all. \nROB How do you know about that? \nBARRY Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name? \nROB You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? \"Motel Matches?\" \"I Want You?\" \"I Hope You're Happy Now?\" \"Green Shirt?\" His records should be sealed in cases that say \"in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass.\" \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night,\" sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing. \nLAURA (O.S.) You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime. \nShe laughs a bit nervously. \nLAURA (O.S.) (machine) And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking? \nROB (barely a whisper) Nothing. \nLAURA (O.S.) We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much. \nROB Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know. \nLAURA (O.S.) Will you call me? \nROB I don't have your number. \nLAURA (O.S.) Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like. \nROB You do, huh. \nHe hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile.  He gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down.  He picks up the phone and dials. \nROB Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond, North Side... thank you. \nHe writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera. \nROB You know the worst thing about being rejected?  The complete lack of control due to loss of control. \nHe picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to us -- \nROB If I could only control the when and how of being dumped by somebody then it wouldn't seem as bad.  But then, of course -- \nHe hangs up quickly -- \nROB -- it wouldn't be rejection, would it?  It would be mutual consent.  It would be musical differences.  I would be pursuing a solo career. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. IAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob is tucked into a phone booth across the street.  He can see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window.  He picks up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as he dials... a muffled male \"hello?\" is heard and Rob hangs up.  He does it again.  And again.  And again.  Until -- \nINT. IAN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT \nStill an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed \"Woodstock - The Movie\" poster, stacks of new fiction, a bread maker -- you get the idea.  Ian is shorter than Laura, scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve Guttenberg.  He stares at Laura with amused exasperation. \nShe picks up the phone -- \nLAURA Hello. \nROB It's me. \nLAURA I figured it was. (re: traffic noise) Where are you? \nROB I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing \"Doctor Who\"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him. \nLAURA I'm not -- hold on... \nShe walks into another room, shutting the door behind her. \nOn a bookshelf is a picture of a younger Ian in a tunic, emoting on some college stage.  She turns it face down. \nLAURA I'm not in love with Ian, okay? \nShe wanders over to the window, looking out absently.  She sees Rob down there at the phone booth. \nROB Are you still in love with me? \nLAURA Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later. \nROB Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever -- \nLAURA (indignant) I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment. \nROB I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you. \nLAURA You don't ever think about other people? \nROB No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it. \nIAN (O.S.) (through the door) Laura?  Are you okay? \nRob walks through Uptown toward the train. \nROB And suddenly I am fine.  For the moment there is not one extra pound on my chest.  This is fate.  Alison married Kevin.  You get it?  That's fate.  That's got nothing to do with me, that is beyond my control, beyond my fault... \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos. \nHe begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women. \nROB I want to see the others on the Big Top Five.  Penny, who wouldn't let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard Chris Thompson. Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and Charlie, who I have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self-confidence, the works.  There's this Springsteen song, \"Bobby Jean,\" off Born in the USA.  About a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck.  Well, I'd like my life to be like a Springsteen song.  Just once.  I know I'm not born to run, and it's clear that Halsted Street is nothing like Thunder Road, but feelings can't be that different, can they?  I'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that I have forgiven them.  And say good luck, goodbye. No hard feelings.  And then they'd feel good and I'd feel good.  We'd all feel good.  I'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again. That'd be good.  Great even. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other. \nROB Penny Hardwick?  This is Rob Gordon... From High school... Yeah. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nRob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation. \nThey look happy as they walk down the street. \nROB (V.O.) Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school when I broke it off with her because she wouldn't sleep with me.  In fact she's even more beautiful, and really grown into herself. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA mid-scale trattoria.  Rob and Penny sit at table laughing and talking.  If we didn't know better we might think there is chemistry. \nROB (V.O.) She tells me about her life, and I get it.  And I tell about mine, and she's interested. \nCLOSE-UP -- ROB TALKING \nROB (V.O.) And then, with no real explanation, I just launch into it: I tell her about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and Kevin Bannister... \nROB ...and you wanted to sleep with Chris Thompson instead of me, and... and I thought you could help me understand why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected and... \nHe slows to a stop.  We see Penny as she goes from happy to livid. \nPENNY Rob.  I was crazy about you.  I wanted to sleep with you, one day, but not when I was sixteen.  When you broke up with me -- when you broke up with me -- because I was, to use your charming expression, tight, I cried and cried and I hated you.  And then that little shitbag asked me out, and I was too tired to fight him off, and it wasn't rape because I said okay, but it wasn't far off. And I didn't have sex with anyone else until after college because I hated it so much.  And now you want to have a chat about rejection? Well, fuck you, Rob. \nPenny stands and leaves.  Rob just sits. \nROB (cheerful) So that's another one I don't have to worry about.  I should have done this years ago. \nRob indicates to an off-screen waiter. \nROB Check... \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Sarah's easy to find.  She still sends me Christmas cards with her address and phone number on them. They never say anything else, except for \"Merry Christmas, Love Sarah.\" I send her equally blank ones back. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT - ROB'S POV \nof a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way.  She looks at Rob with a bit too much in her eyes. \nINT. CARMEN'S PIZZA - NIGHT \nRob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza. \nSARAH I can't believe I left you for him... Crazy. \nSarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing. \nRob looks uncomfortable.  This is more than he was looking for. \nROB Well... probably seemed like a good idea at the time. \nShe looks up again... \nSARAH Probably.  I can't remember why, though. \n...and back down again. \nROB (V.O.) I haven't got the heart for the rejection conversation.  There are no hard feelings here, and I am glad that she ditched me, and not the other way around. \nIan trips backward and scurries out the door. \nCUT TO FANTASY #3: \nRob, Dick, and Barry just beating the living shit out of Ian, Rodney King style.  Ian lies on the floor trying to cover himself.  Dick, already out of breath, breaks from the pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts it over his head, preparing for the death blow. \nCUT BACK TO REALITY \nIAN So shall we leave it at that then? \nROB I dunno. \nIAN Think about it, Rob. \nIan walks out.  Rob looks spent.  He shuffles toward the back of the store. \nINT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY \nRob is laying on his back, staring at the ceiling.  Dick sticks his head in the door. \nDICK Phone, Rob.  Somebody named Charlie. \nRob pulls the phone into the bathroom and shuts the door. \nBATHROOM Rob curls up with the phone. \nROB Hello? \nINT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - INTERCUT \nCharlie looks even better than when we saw her in college. \nCHARLIE Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets. \nROB Yeah, sure... \nCHARLIE Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now. \nROB Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you? \nCHARLIE Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man? \nROB Uh...yes, at the moment. \nCHARLIE Great.  Gotta go.  See you then. \nINT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM \nSERIES OF SHOTS OVER THE COURSE OF DINNER \nSexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties crowd of successful, beautiful people.  Rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat.  Rob's central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's face.  His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he says nothing to anyone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nRob is a little too settled into the couch, somewhat bleary. \nEveryone gone but the two of them, Charlie plops down into a chair across from Rob. \nROB Hey Charlie. \nCHARLIE Hey Rob. \nROB Why did you break up with me for Marco? \nCHARLIE (on her feet) Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things. \nROB Huh? \nCHARLIE There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this? \nROB C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell? \nCharlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of \"contemplation.\" \nCHARLIE It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself? (pause) Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of. (pause) A little sunnier.  Sparkier. (pause) I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation. \nROB Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you? \nCHARLIE Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings. \nCUT TO: \nRob flops onto the couch and surveys the room. \nROB It's a dump, isn't it? \nLaura sits down, on the other side of the couch. \nLAURA Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better. \nROB I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place. \nLAURA You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better. \nROB I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him? \nLAURA Ray.  I hate Ian. \nROB I hate him too.  So I just call him \"Mavis.\" Or \"Sissyboy.\" Or \"Mavis the Sissyboy.\" \nLaura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to Rob.  Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes. \nROB This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways. \nLAURA You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about. \nROB You know I'm a good person. \nLAURA Mmm hmm. \nROB You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it. \nLAURA Oh ho, so very infrequently. \nHe moves a little closer. \nROB You know my favorite beverage is your bath water. \nShe laughs.  He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her... She almost goes for it, but instead gets to her feet. \nLAURA Time to go. \nShe goes to her bags.  Rob points to a pile of CDs. \nROB Don't forget your CDs. \nLAURA Those aren't mine. \nROB Sure they are. \nLAURA They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff... (bending down to the pile) Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I... \nROB Okay, okay.  I get the picture. \nLAURA I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it. \nROB I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him. \nLAURA You're being deliberately obtuse. \nROB I guess I am. \nLAURA Well, think about it. \nShe hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits. \nROB Fuck. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to the camera. \nROB What's the point in thinking about it?  If I ever have another relationship, I'll buy her, whoever she is, stuff that she oughta like but doesn't know about -- that's what new boyfriends are for.  And hopefully I won't borrow money from her, or have an affair, and she won't need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood, and then there won't be anything to think about. Laura didn't run off with Ian because I bought her CDs she wasn't that keen on, and to pretend otherwise is just... just... psychowank.  If she thinks that, then she's missing the Brazilian rainforest for the twigs. If I can't buy the Plastic People of the Universe's first album for new girlfriends, then I might as well give up, because I'm not sure I know how to do anything else. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - MORNING \nRob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's window he passes.  He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey.  Rob keeps walking. \nINT. RECORD STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY \nRob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials... \nLAURA In a minute.  When I get it together. \nBARRY (to Dick) What about Sabbath?  Or Nirvana? They're into death. \nRob tries to signal to them to shut up but they don't see him.  He moves as far away as the cord will let me. \nROB Can I do anything? \nDICK \"Abraham, Martin, and John.\" That's a nice one. \nBARRY \"Somebody's Gonna Die\" by Blitz. \"Bella Lugosi's Dead,\" Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling. \nLAURA No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday. \nROB Me? \nLAURA My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like... (small laugh) He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to. \nROB Do you want me to be there? \nLAURA I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand. \nRob is silent. \nLAURA Look, are you coming or not? \nROB Yes, of course. \nLAURA Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do. \nROB Sure.  I'll see you on Friday. \nShe hangs up. \nBARRY (to the tune of \"Candle In the Wind\") \"Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di da di da/ (belting it out) Seems to me/you lived your life/like a dentist in the wind... \nRob stomps toward Barry, who jumps over the counter to keep singing -- \nINT. LIZ'S CAR - DAY \nTHUNDERCLAPS and RAIN.  Rob is in a somber suit, looking through the windshield wipers as Liz drives. \nROB So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him? \nLIZ It's a crematorium. \nROB You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus. \nLIZ What difference does it make? \nROB Is Ray going? \nLIZ No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story. \nROB Isn't that how it is for everybody? \nINT. CHAPEL TWO \nLiz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room.  At the front is a coffin, resting on a stand.  Laura, her younger sister JO, and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the MINISTER. \nMINISTER ...Now and forever, Amen. \nHe nods \"offstage,\" and a muffled mechanical noise is heard. \nThe coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it. \nA low, baleful human HOWL is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume. \nROB (V.O.) I hear something in Laura's voice, but I know what it is, and at that moment I want to go to her and offer to become a different person, to remove all trace of what is me, as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better... \nINT. CHAPEL PARLOR \nRob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her mother, hugging them.  After awhile, Laura sees Rob through the throng, hanging back.  She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time... \nROB (V.O.) ...And when she let's go of me, I feel I don't need to become a different person.  It's happened already. \nINT. LAURA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nA cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste.  Rob and Liz stand, drinking wine.  Jo approaches them. \nLIZ (to Jo) How are you? \nJO I'm all right, I suppose.  And Mom's not too bad.  But Laura... I dunno. \nROB I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later. \nLAURA It'll have to be sex, then. \nShe pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck.  She pauses and regards him from above. \nLAURA Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here. \nROB Hi. \nLAURA I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today. \nLaura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing. \nROB You know, with Ray... \nLAURA Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again. \nROB No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill? \nLAURA Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about. \nROB I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used? \nLaura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry. \nROB Look, we can do other things. \nLAURA I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad? \nShe rolls off of him into her seat.  They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Later, I wonder if I was really worried about where Ian has been.  I have no idea where he's been, and that gives me every right to insist on protection.  But in truth, it was the power that interested me more than the fear.  I wanted to hurt her, on this day of all days, just because it's the first time since she's left that I've been able to. \nINT. BAR - LATER \nRob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other.  We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them. \nROB Laura... \nLAURA I'm too tired not to go out with you. \nRob leans forward. \nROB So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together. \nLAURA (nodding) Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't. \nROB What about Ian? \nLAURA Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart. \nROB Mission accomplished. \nLAURA I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so... \nShe looks up at him. \nLAURA Let's go home.  Okay? \nROB Okay. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB But wouldn't you know it?  Suddenly I feel panicky, and sick, and I want to run around and sleep with female recording artists... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nPost-lovemaking.  Rob and Laura lie on their backs. \nROB C'mon.  I want to know. \nINT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob paces, Laura sits on the couch, smiling. \nLAURA I called Dan Koretzky because he -- \nROB Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this? \nLAURA Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, \"would be a highly anticipated event, locally.\" He helped me put out a press release. \nROB WHAT? \nLAURA Just local, of course. \nROB And the \"triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?\" \"Triumphant?\" \"Return?\" \nLAURA I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back. \nROB You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled? \nLAURA What do you ever do that can't be cancelled? \nROB That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time? \nLAURA Barry said its done. \nROB Barry?  Barry knows about this? \nLAURA Yeah.  His band is playing a set. \nRob wheels on her. \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nRob and Barry. \nROB Like fuck you are. \nBARRY Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are. \nROB I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play. \nBARRY We're getting that anyway. \nROB What is she doing?  Okay, 20%. \nBARRY No.  We need the gig. \nROB 110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play. \nBARRY We're not as bad as you think, Rob. \nROB You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them? \nBARRY We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey. \nROB Sonic Death Monkey. \nBARRY What do you think?  Dick likes it. \nROB Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey. \nBARRY I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact. \nROB You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night. \nBARRY That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready. \nBarry wanders off laughing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nRob and Laura. \nLAURA They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour. \nROB It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them -- \nLAURA We took care of that. \nRob's brow furrows. \nCAROLINE Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more. \nROB What do you mean, four more? \nCAROLINE Well if one of them is this \"Sin City\" thing -- \nROB Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so? \nCAROLINE Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger. \nRob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged. \nROB Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... \"Sin City.\" \"New Rose,\" by The Damned. \"Hit It and Quit It\" by Funkadelic. \"Shipbuilding,\" Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... \"Mystery Train\" by Elvis Presley... And... \"Spaced Cowboy\" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but... \nCAROLINE Fine.  That's great. \nROB Is that it? \nCAROLINE Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time. \nROB Sure, but is that it for the list? \nCAROLINE That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again? \nROB Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So... (looking over her pad at the list) I should really put a James Brown in there -- \nCAROLINE Nice friend. \nROB Yeah. \nCAROLINE What's his name? \nROB Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl. \nCAROLINE \"Music for Old People.\" What does that mean? \nROB Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like \"the Upsetter\" by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, in there.  Instead of \"Sin City.\" \nShe scribbles and writes. \nCAROLINE Okay. \"Dance Music For Old People?\" \nROB Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them. \nCAROLINE And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards? \nROB Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape? \nCAROLINE Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home. \nROB Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB A good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem.  You gotta kick off with a killer, to hold the attention.  Then you have to take it up a notch, but not blow your wad, so maybe cool it off a notch, and you can't put the same artist twice on the tape, except if some subtle point or lesson or theme involved, and even then not the two of them in a row, and you can't woo somebody with Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and then bash their head off with something like GBH's \"City Baby Attacked by Rats,\" and... oh, there are a lot of rules.  Anyway, I worked hard at this one. \nINT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nRob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the stereo. \nHe has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-outs, and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records. \nLAURA Who's that for? \nRob winces, turns.  He's busted. \nROB This?  Oh, just that woman who interviewed me for The Reader.  Carol? Caroline?  Something like that. \nLaura turns and walks out of the room. \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nRob is tucked into the corner, on the phone. \nROB Hi, Caroline... Oh, it's Rob.  Yeah, listen, I have a new list for you and -- Oh.  Yes.  Of course...  Well maybe next week they could print a, uh, retraction.  Or a correction. Because the list I have now it really much more -- right.  Okay.  Anyway, I have your tape.  That's right. Shall I mail it to you?  Or... would you like to have a drink? \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \n", "test1_input": "Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching.  All three of them are in their own private fantasies with Marie. \nDICK She shouldn't done it on \"The Number Four With a Smile.\" \nBARRY Isn't her album called \"Number Four With A Smile?\" \nDICK That's what I said. \nBARRY No, no, no, you said \"The Number Four With a Smile,\" and there's no \"The\" at the front of the title of the album. \nDICK It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a \"The.\"  But I could be wrong. \nBARRY You can be and are wrong. \nThey drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie. \nBARRY I wanna date a musician... \nROB (nods in agreement) I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes. \nBARRY ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes... \nDICK Just in the background somewhere. \nMARIE \nas the song ends, and she smiles out over the room.  The audience applauds. \nMARIE Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not supposed to like that song, but I do.  I'm gonna take a break for a second.  Anybody wants to buy one of my tapes, they're five bucks up here. One of my other personalities will be selling them. \nROB, DICK, AND BARRY \nBARRY Let's go get one. \nROB Let's not. \nDICK I want a tape. \nBarry and Dick stand and begin to move off... \nROB I don't need to go up there right now. \n...and they're gone.  After a beat, Rob gets up and follows them. \nFOOT OF THE STAGE \nDick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind them.  Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until the three get up front. \nMARIE Enjoying yourselves? \nThey dart eyes to each other, then nod. \nMARIE Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself. \nROB Good. \nRob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change... \nROB So you live in Chicago now? \nMARIE Yup.  Not far from here, actually. \nBARRY You like it? \nMARIE It's okay.  Hey.  You guys might be the sort to know.  Are there any good record stores around here or do I have to go downtown? \nBarry and Dick do not try to control themselves.  They point to Rob. \nDICK He's got one! \nBARRY On Clark Street! \nDICK A couple blocks!  About six! \nBARRY We work there! \nDICK You'd love it! \nMarie laughs. \nMARIE What do you sell? \nBARRY A little of anything that matters. Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip- hop, ska, new wave... \n", "test1_true": "The line behind them is moving in, and Marie smiles at them and turns to someone else.  They scurry back toward their table. \nROB What did you tell her about the shop for? \nBARRY I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy. \nRob looks over Barry at Marie.  She catches his eye as she looks over the room.  His eyes shoot to the floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER \nRob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura called last night. \nBARRY (O.S.) ROB!  PHONE! \nRob reaches over and hits the SPEAKER button on the phone, still in the groove of sorting. \nROB Rob here. \nLIZ (O.S.) Hey.  It's Liz. \nROB What's happenin'. \nLIZ You called this morning? \nROB Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole. \nLIZ How're you holding up? \nROB Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, \"you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be.\" You know? \nLIZ Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy -- \n-- Dick bursts in, huge-faced -- \nDICK Rob. \nROB Liz, hold on a second -- (turns to Dick) What? \nDICK Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now! \nRob freezes, he and Dick turn to the speaker, which cranks Marie's voice.  Rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset. \nROB Liz, can you hold for a second? \nHe hits hold. \nROB (to Dick) I'll be out there!  Go! (picks up the phone) Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow night?  Great.  Green Mill.  Fine. Seven?  Done.  Thanks.  Right.  Bye. \nHe hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot- square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is mounted on the wall, and moves out into the \nFRONT ROOM \nand up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's music off.  He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her eyes. \nROB Oh.  Hi. \nMarie smiles. \nMARIE (re: music) Don't you like that? \nROB No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well. \nHe reaches back and puts it back on.  He cracks his face into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door. Marie watches him go. \nSTOCK ROOM \nwhere as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces: \nROB WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!! \nDick comes in -- \nDICK Rob --! \nROB -- FUCK OFF! \nDick backs out fast.  Rob leans on a wall.  Barry enters -- \nBARRY We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us. \nROB That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry! \n", "test2_input": "MARIE Thank you. \nRob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info. \nROB Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? \nMARIE Yup. \nMarie slides closer, turning her back on the others.  The loop is closed. \nROB You share a place with T-Bone? \nMARIE No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that. \nROB I understand completely. \nSERIES OF CUTS - ELAPSED TIME \nRob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus. \nROB (V.O.) Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... \nROB AND MARIE - LATER \nMARIE Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd -- \nROB What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me. \nMARIE Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks. \nRob glows -- \nROB (V.O.) Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. \nROB AND MARIE \nROB Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it? \nMARIE The Conformist. \nROB Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly! \nMARIE (laughs) You haven't even seen it! \nROB Nor have you! \nThey just laugh and laugh -- \nROB (V.O.) References, titles, lyrics, flew and met each other in mid-air embraces. The evening goes with breathtaking precision. \nINT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob and Marie are kissing standing up. \nMARIE Are you okay? \nROB (nodding) Yes.  You? \nMARIE For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening. \nROB I'm sure it isn't. \nMARIE Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee? \nROB Whiskey. \nMarie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner. \nMARIE Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket. \nROB I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'. \nMARIE When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff. \nShe plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table. \nMARIE I'd like it if you could stay the night. \nROB (as if it is dawning on him) Oh, right.  Alright. \nMARIE Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz. \nROB I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it. \n", "test2_true": "ROB Yeah. \nMARIE Good. \nMarie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom. \nRob just stands there... and the LIGHTING CHANGES. \nROB (to camera) Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women. And do they all look like Richard Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde? Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves... well, about nine million, give or take fifty.  And they're just men.  Regular guys. We're just guys, because I, even I, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club.  In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover. \"How does he do it?\" you ask. \"He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's going on?  Listen up, because I think I can explain, with all modesty aside: I ask questions.  That's it.  That's my secret.  It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom.  There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different.  If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway? \n...he goes through a door into the bedroom.  Marie is taking off her earrings. \nROB Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on? \nMARIE God, you ask a lot of questions. \nINT. MARIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nRob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him. \nROB (V.O.) But in the morning we were just two people, slightly hung-over, who were not in love, sharing the same space. And I feel... \nRob looks to the camera. \nROB Sex is about the only grown-up thing that I know how to do; It's weird, then, that it's the only thing that can make me feel like a ten-year- old. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nThe two of them come out of the building and into the street. \nROB Which way are you going? \nMARIE (points left) That way.  You? \nROB (points right) That way. \nMARIE And so it is.  I'll talk to you later. \nROB I'll call you. \nMARIE (smiles) Right. \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nEmpty.  Dick prices records out on the floor.  Rob leans against the register.  Barry sits on a stool next to him. \nThey're top-fiving it.  Rob's heart isn't in it. \nROB Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... \"Janie Jones,\" the Clash, from The Clash. \nBARRY Ehh. \nROB \"Thunder Road,\" Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana, Nevermind. \nBARRY Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that? \nROB Shut up. \"Let's Get It On,\" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. \"Airbag,\" Radiohead, from OK Computer. \nBARRY (sarcastic) Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! \"Let's Get It On?\" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that? \nDICK Rob.  Phone. (whispers) It's Laura. \nRob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord.  Deep breath. \nROB Hi. \nLAURA - INTERCUT \nLAURA Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around? \nROB I'll look for 'em.  How you doing? \nLAURA I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff... \nROB Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk. \nLAURA We'll talk some other time. \nROB Great... That's great. \nRob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone. \n", "test3_input": "ROB You're being stupid. \nLAURA How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice? \nRob is silent. \nLAURA All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use? \nROB No use. \nINT./EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nRob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical -- Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible.  Rob joins them in contemplation. \nROB What is this. \nDICK It's Vince and Justin. \nROB Who's that? \nBARRY The little skate-fuckers. \nROB No way. \nBARRY Yes way.  It's really... \nRob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce -- \nBARRY (pained to say it) It's really fucking good. \nDick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen... \nHe takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, seemingly with a mission. \nVince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street.  When they see Rob they stop, get ready to flee.  He walks across to them.  Dick comes out and hovers in the background. \nROB Your tape.  It's good. \nThey mumble thanks. \nROB It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys. \nVINCE Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride. \nROB We're not there yet, Justin. \nVINCE I'm Vince. \nROB Whatever. \nHe begins to move toward the store.  Vince and Justin look at each other.  Rob gets to the door but stops and turns. \nROB Hey.  What's the name of your band? \nJUSTIN The Kinky Wizards. \nROB What? \nVINCE We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair. \nROB Nice. \nVINCE What's the name of your label? \nRob looks at them.  Then at Dick.  Then through the window at Barry, inside looking out.  Then at his own reflection in the window.  Then back at them. \nROB Broken Records.  Welcome aboard. \nRob walks back inside.  He seems to be shaking a little. \nBARRY What the fuck is that? \nROB What? \nBARRY I heard you, man.  Don't give me that \"what\" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them. \nROB So?  You even said they're good. \nBARRY HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector? \nRob waves him off and disappears into the stock room.  Laura enters. \nLAURA Hey, Barry. \n", "test3_true": "LAURA Where's Rob? \nBARRY The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment? \nLAURA What are you talking about? \nBARRY Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all. \nLaura puts it together, and smiles.  She goes to the back and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking. \nROB Hi. \nLAURA Hi.  What are you doing? \nROB Nothing. \nLAURA Wanna go to dinner? \nROB Where? \nLAURA At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work. \nROB Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I. \nLAURA I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him. \nROB Ha. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB We're at a point where I can't really walk away from gauntlets she might throw down, and so I go.  And wouldn't you know it, I sort of fall in love with Paul and Miranda -- with what they have, and the way they treat each other, and the way they make me feel as if I'm the new center of their world.  I think they're great, and I want to see them twice a week, every week, for the rest of my life. Only right at the end of the evening do I realize I've been set up. \nINT. PAUL AND MIRANDA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nAfter dinner.  Rob ambles in from the dining room.  Laura close behind.  He looks through the bookshelves until he finds a meager little grouping of CDs.  He moves up to them and scans the titles: Tina Turner.  Billy Joel.  Kate Bush. Pink Floyd.  Simply Red.  The Beatles.  The Windham Hill Sampler... \nPAUL Lame, right? \nRob turns around to see PAUL behind him. \nROB Oh, I don't know.  The Beatles are okay. \nPaul laughs. \nPAUL We're kinda out of date. \nROB Hey, to each his own, I say. \nPAUL Maybe we can come by your store and you can hook us up. \nROB Sure, sure.  Any time. \nLAURA Better hurry, though, Paul.  Rob started a record label, so he's gonna be in the shop less and less. \nRob looks at her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROB AND LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nas they come in the door. \nLAURA ...\"To each his own!\" Unbelievable! You!  Rob Gordon said that.  You even sounded like you meant it. \nThey throw their jackets over a chair.  Rob turns on the CD player and \"Call Me A Liar\" by Palace begins to play. \nROB (smiling) You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick. \nLAURA I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way. \nShe moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him.  They look deeply at each other.  She breaks away from him and walks into the bedroom.  He turns off the stereo and follows her. \nEXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING \nRob walks to work, drinking his coffee.  He stops and backs up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up. \n\"'I SOLD MY MOM'S WHEELCHAIR'/the debut single from The Kinky Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of DJ ROB GORDON/\"Dance Music For Old People\" \nRob scowls, and storms off. \n"}

{"test1_input": "Rob relaxes and goes back to work. \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) Great.  Can I have it then? \nBARRY (O.S.) No, you can't. \nRob deflates, shaking his head. \nSTORE FLOOR \nBarry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the CUSTOMER, a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat. \nCUSTOMER Why not? \nBARRY Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells \"I Just Called To Say I Loved You?\" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. \nCUSTOMER What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you -- \nBARRY Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? \nThe Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store. \nCUSTOMER Okay, okay, buddy.  I didn't know it was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square Guy Day.  My apologies.  I'll be on my way. \nHe steps out of the door. \nBARRY B'Bye! \nOutside, anger catches up to the Customer.  He turns and throws up a middle finger -- \nCUSTOMER FUCK YOU! \n-- and bolts.  Barry smiles and turns to see \nROB \nstanding in the doorway of the stock room.  He feigns applause. \nROB Nice, Barry. \nBARRY Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  \"Is it better to burn out than to fade away?\" \nROB You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry. \nBARRY We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is \"Don't Drive Drunk.\" I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny. \nROB Not the point. \nBARRY Oh, so what's the point then? \nROB I don't want you talking to our customers like that again. \nBARRY \"Our customers?\" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular? \nRob's face begins to redden with anger. \nROB Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop. \nBARRY Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal. \nROB What did he ever do to you? \nBARRY He offended me with his terrible taste. \nROB It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's. \nBARRY Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. (sarcastic) You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club? \nRob is red and seething. \nBARRY And by the way, I tell you this for your own good: That's the worst sweater I've ever seen.  I have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone I'm on speaking terms with.  It's a disgrace to the human race. \nRob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall.  Rob is so mad he can't say anything. \nDICK Hey, guys... Hey. \nRob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast. \nBARRY (extremely shaken) What are you, some kind of fucking maniac?  If this jacket's torn you're gonna pay big. \nBarry stomps out of the store.  Rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder.  Dick appears in the doorway, terrified. \nDICK Are you all right? \n", "test1_true": "DICK 'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him. \nRob nods.  Dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships. \nDICK I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff. \nROB Fine. \nDICK I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle (flashes CD of pretty woman) playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing. \nDick laughs nervously. \nDICK Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that -- \nROB I understand, Dick. \nDICK Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing? \nRob looks up at Dick, who is so nervous that his brow is wet. \nROB No.  Thanks though, Dick. \nDick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Number three in the top five break- ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore year of college.  Some people never got over 'Nam, or the night their band opened for Nirvana.  I guess I never really got over Charlie. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - FLASHBACK \nAbout twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach- blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry. \nShe is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER, driving her points home with a forefinger. \nROB (V.O.) She looked different.  Dramatic. Exotic.  She talked a lot, about remarkably interesting things like music, books, film, and politics... \nINT. CAFE - DAY \nA younger Rob sits amongst a group of STUDENTS who are engaged in a heated conversation.  He is smiling, mouth closed, just happy to be there.  Charlie sitting next to him, tousles his hair as she talks incessantly. \nROB (V.O.) (over her talking) ...so we didn't have those terrible, strained sentences, that seemed to characterized most of my relationships.  And she liked me. She liked me.  She liked me. \nCharlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking... \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nRob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about something. \nRob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a store window REFLECTION. \nROB (V.O.) We went out for two years, and for every single minute I felt as though I was standing on a dangerously narrow ledge.  I couldn't get comfortable, couldn't ever stretch out and relax. Why would a girl -- no, a woman -- like Charlie go out with someone who only a few years ago sewed a Foghat patch on his jacket?  I felt like all those people who suddenly shaved their heads and said they'd always been punks.  I felt like a fraud. And I was depressed by the lack of flamboyance in my wardrobe... \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe fabulous sophomore design student's studio apartment: \nWhite wood floor, white walls, overvarnished door, Doisneaux print on the wall, futon on the floor.  Rob lies back on his elbows, watching Charlie in uncomfortable, worried awe.  She stands, her back to him, wearing only her underwear and pulling on a T-shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look back on. \nROB (V.O.) ...I worried about my abilities as a lover.  I was intimidated by the other men in her design department, and became convinced that she was going to leave me for one of them. \nCharlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence. \nROB (V.O.) She left me for one of them.  The dreaded Marco. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt is RAINING like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit window, maniacally gesturing.  The curtains part and Charlie's figure appears, clad only in a sheet.  Next to her is a tall, built, handsome man, MARCO, also in a sheet. \nEventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries his head in his hands.  The light goes out. \nROB (V.O.) And I lost it.  I lost it all. Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nRob wandering through the rain. \nROB (V.O.) Any small idea of personal identity that I had acquired up to that point. \n", "test1_id": 1746, "test2_input": "BARRY Rob!  What about the Beatles?  What about the fucking Rolling Stones? What about fucking... fucking... Beethoven?  Track one side one of the Fifth Symphony?  You shouldn't be allowed to run a record shop. You shouldn't be allowed to -- \nSFX: BARRY'S VOICE FADES OUT.  Rob's mouth slacks and he stares off. \nROB (V.O.) There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does \"yet\" mean, anyway?  \"I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet.\" What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it? \nSFX: BACK TO THE ROOM. \nBARRY -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- \nROB -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean? \nBarry just looks at Rob.  He pulls out a Game Boy and begins playing. \nROB Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?\" \nBARRY To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century. \nROB Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" what would you think? \nBarry shuts off the Game Boy. \nBARRY I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you. \nROB No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it? \nBARRY I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say? \nROB Just listen to me.  If I said to you -- \nBARRY \"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" yeah, yeah, I hear you -- \nROB Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it? \nBARRY Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone... \nRob brightens.  Barry finally considers. \nBARRY ...But the word \"yet...\" Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. \nROB But in your opinion, would I definitely go? \nBARRY How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. \nRob darkens. \nROB Why would they care? \nBARRY Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass. \nThey look at each other for a strange moment. \nBARRY I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now? \nROB Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours. \nBarry stands. \nBARRY Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock. \nROB Ha. \nDICK I can't go to the club tonight, guys. \nBARRY Why? \nDick smiles sheepishly. \nBARRY Who are you going to see? \nDICK Nobody. \nBarry's eyes widen. \nBARRY Rob, looky looky.  Dick!  Are you getting some?! \nSilence. \nBARRY Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all. \nROB How do you know about that? \nBARRY Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name? \n", "test2_true": "DICK Anna. \nBARRY Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda? \nDICK Anna Moss. \nBARRY Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry? \nROB Shut the fuck up, Barry. \nBARRY Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some. \nBarry picks up his bag and heads for the door. \nROB Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday. \nBARRY Suck my ass. \nROB Terrific. \nRob looks to Dick, who looks guilty. \nROB Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole. \nDICK Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. \nDick exits.  Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks out over the empty store.  He TALKS TO CAMERA as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one... \nROB Why does it bother Barry that much that Dick is seeing someone?  He's worried about how his life is turning out, and he's lonely, and lonely people are the bitterest of them all. \n...until all the lights are out.  Rob's silhouette slips out the door. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nA downpour is on.  Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth, the little kind. \nROB (into phone) Hi.  It's me... I'm right outside... I know... I know... I figured I could just walk you to the train and you could go... home.  Or whatever it is... No!  Of course not -- okay. I'll be right here. \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING \nRob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long hallway from the elevators to the door. \nROB (V.O.) Laura looks different.  Less stress- out, more in control.  Something has happened, maybe something real, or maybe something in her head.  Whatever it is, you can see that she thinks she's started out on some new stage in her life.  She hasn't.  I'm not going to let her. \nShe emerges from doors, says something to him and they start walking, sharing her umbrella. \nINT. OLDE TOWNE ALE HOUSE - NIGHT \nRob and Laura have just sat down in a booth. \nLAURA So, how are you? \nROB Have you slept with him yet? \nLAURA I told you I slept with him. \nROB No, not -- I mean have you, you know -- \nLAURA Is that why you wanted to see me? \nROB I guess. \nLAURA Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say? \nROB I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth. \nShe looks past him. \nLAURA I can't do that. \nShe starts to say something else but Rob is up and out. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nRob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be the only one going his way. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him.  He talks a little loud, due to the headphones. \nROB Tonight we're gonna figure out the five best angry songs about women. Let's go... \nHe holds up a stack of records and CDs. \n", "test2_id": 1747, "test3_input": "Rob walks through Uptown toward the train. \nROB And suddenly I am fine.  For the moment there is not one extra pound on my chest.  This is fate.  Alison married Kevin.  You get it?  That's fate.  That's got nothing to do with me, that is beyond my control, beyond my fault... \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos. \nHe begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women. \nROB I want to see the others on the Big Top Five.  Penny, who wouldn't let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard Chris Thompson. Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and Charlie, who I have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self-confidence, the works.  There's this Springsteen song, \"Bobby Jean,\" off Born in the USA.  About a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck.  Well, I'd like my life to be like a Springsteen song.  Just once.  I know I'm not born to run, and it's clear that Halsted Street is nothing like Thunder Road, but feelings can't be that different, can they?  I'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that I have forgiven them.  And say good luck, goodbye. No hard feelings.  And then they'd feel good and I'd feel good.  We'd all feel good.  I'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again. That'd be good.  Great even. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other. \nROB Penny Hardwick?  This is Rob Gordon... From High school... Yeah. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nRob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation. \nThey look happy as they walk down the street. \nROB (V.O.) Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school when I broke it off with her because she wouldn't sleep with me.  In fact she's even more beautiful, and really grown into herself. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA mid-scale trattoria.  Rob and Penny sit at table laughing and talking.  If we didn't know better we might think there is chemistry. \nROB (V.O.) She tells me about her life, and I get it.  And I tell about mine, and she's interested. \nCLOSE-UP -- ROB TALKING \nROB (V.O.) And then, with no real explanation, I just launch into it: I tell her about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and Kevin Bannister... \nROB ...and you wanted to sleep with Chris Thompson instead of me, and... and I thought you could help me understand why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected and... \nHe slows to a stop.  We see Penny as she goes from happy to livid. \nPENNY Rob.  I was crazy about you.  I wanted to sleep with you, one day, but not when I was sixteen.  When you broke up with me -- when you broke up with me -- because I was, to use your charming expression, tight, I cried and cried and I hated you.  And then that little shitbag asked me out, and I was too tired to fight him off, and it wasn't rape because I said okay, but it wasn't far off. And I didn't have sex with anyone else until after college because I hated it so much.  And now you want to have a chat about rejection? Well, fuck you, Rob. \nPenny stands and leaves.  Rob just sits. \nROB (cheerful) So that's another one I don't have to worry about.  I should have done this years ago. \nRob indicates to an off-screen waiter. \nROB Check... \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Sarah's easy to find.  She still sends me Christmas cards with her address and phone number on them. They never say anything else, except for \"Merry Christmas, Love Sarah.\" I send her equally blank ones back. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT - ROB'S POV \nof a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way.  She looks at Rob with a bit too much in her eyes. \nINT. CARMEN'S PIZZA - NIGHT \nRob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza. \nSARAH I can't believe I left you for him... Crazy. \nSarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing. \nRob looks uncomfortable.  This is more than he was looking for. \nROB Well... probably seemed like a good idea at the time. \nShe looks up again... \nSARAH Probably.  I can't remember why, though. \n...and back down again. \nROB (V.O.) I haven't got the heart for the rejection conversation.  There are no hard feelings here, and I am glad that she ditched me, and not the other way around. \n", "test3_true": "Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully.  It's clear she doesn't want to shut the door, but she does.  Rob turns and walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks TO CAMERA. \nROB I could've ended up having sex back there.  And what better way to exorcize rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you, right?  But you wouldn't be sleeping with a person.  You'd be sleeping with a whole sad single-person culture.  It'd be like sleeping with Talia Shire in \"Rocky\" if you weren't Rocky. \nINT. ROB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP: PHONE BOOK \nas Rob's finger moves down the column, then stops. \nRob looks up with a little shock, almost recoiling from the phone book. \nCUT TO: \nROB IN HIS CHAIR \nRob to camera. \nROB Charlie's in the fucking phone book. She has come to assume such an importance, I feel she should be living on Mars.  She's an extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, not a person with an answering machine, in the phone book... I call and hang up on her voice mail a couple of times, then I leave my name and number and throw in a \"long time-no- see...\" I don't hear anything back from her for a few days.  Now that's more like it, if you're talking about rejection: someone who won't even return your phone messages a decade after she rejected you. \nINT. RECORD STORE - DAY \nRob hears the door open as he stocks shelves, and turns. \nIt's Ian.  Rob reacts, gunfighter eyes. \nROB Can I help you? \nIAN Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian. \nRob says nothing. \nIAN I thought maybe we should talk. Sort a few things out? \nRob is disoriented on the way to angry.  Dick and Barry's ears perk up. \nROB What needs sorting out? \nIAN Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal. \nROB Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it. \nIAN We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house... \nROB Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now. \nIAN We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying? \nROB Yeah. \nIAN Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? \nROB I dunno. \nIAN Think about it, Rob. \nCUT TO FANTASY #1: \nRob looking sure of himself, righteous. \nIAN Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? \nROB I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store. \nIan leaves, rattled. \nCUT TO FANTASY #2: \nSame thing. \nIAN Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? \nROB We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever. \nRob springs toward Ian, but Barry blocks his way.  Dick helps hold Rob back. \nDICK Don't do it, Rob! \nBARRY He's not worth it! \nRob reaches a pointed finger over Barry's shoulder. \nROB Leave town.  Leave the country, you little bitch, because you're gonna look back on walks by the house and ten phone calls a night as a golden age.  Get ready, mutherfucker. \n", "test3_id": 1748}

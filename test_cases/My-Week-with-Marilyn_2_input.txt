150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A 
The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking nervous. They look at each other awkwardly. 
COLIN Aren't you going to throw yours away? 
LUCY Of course not. It's from Marilyn Monroe. He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115. 
COLIN (After a second) Lucy? She turns back to look at him. 
COLIN (CONT'D) I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday. 
LUCY I'm washing my hair. He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She goes but then stops to look back at him. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Did she break your heart? 
COLIN (After a second) A little. 
LUCY Good. It needed breaking. There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke. 
LUCY (CONT'D) (After a second) I might be free on Wednesday. COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's present in his hands. 
CUT TO: 
151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151 
COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way. 
152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152 
OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes in. OLIVIER glances at him. 
OLIVIER "You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended. 
(MORE) 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air... 
COLIN Prospero. 
OLIVIER 
(SMILES) We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep..." COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them. The sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone, what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) (After a second) She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in surprise. 
COLIN You should tell her that. 
OLIVIER Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. (Pause) Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me. 
COLIN I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117. 
OLIVIER 
(SMILES) Miller made me see things differently. (Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best. And believe me, most of the time, I really am the best. He goes to the door and pauses. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) You've done a good job, boy. (Pause) Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box. 
COLIN Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene 90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent. HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then - 
152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A 
The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here. BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and regulars at play. And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action. COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to his woe and his pint. 
MARILYN Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles. 
COLIN Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not to stare. 
MARILYN I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A. 
MARILYN hands COLIN a package. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE 
MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

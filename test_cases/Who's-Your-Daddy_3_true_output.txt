DELIVERYMAN Delivery for Jimmy Nelson. 
EXT. NELSON HOUSE - DAY 
Jimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears in the doorway. 
MOM My goodness, who sent this? 
DELIVERY MAN It's from "Heaven," ma'am. 
DAD Ted. Of course. 
JIMMY (riding around) I love you, Ted! 
MOM We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear? 
DAD Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but... 
At that moment, ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN and his HELPER unload a large crate from another truck. They approach Dad and Mom. 
DELIVERY MAN #2 Delivery for Robert Nelson. 
DAD For me? What is it? 
DELIVERY MAN #2 Appears to be tools, sir. 
MOM Oh, no. Ted's gone completely overboard. 
Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools.  Dad opens one of the drawers.  Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments. Tears in his eyes. 
MOM (CONT'D) Sweetheart, what is it? 
DAD I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors. 
MOM Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance. 
Another delivery truck arrives.  Then the local news vans. Neighbors rush out of their houses. The phone RINGS.  Mom dashes inside. 
INT. THE NELSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Mom grabs the phone. 
MOM Teddy? Is that you? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S ROOM - DAY 
Ted wears a cordless headset phone, as if he was born with it. As he talks, he flexes his muscles in front of a full length mirror. 
TED Well? Surprised? 
MOM What is all this? When are you coming home? 
TED Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry. 
MOM Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive. 
TED Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from. 
Mom looks up as ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN wheels a washing machine and dryer into the house. 
DELIVERY MAN #3 Where do you want them, lady? 
Mom's eyes light up. 
MOM Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes? 
TED Only the best for my mother. 
MOM (softening) You promise you'll finish school? 
TED I'll make you very proud.

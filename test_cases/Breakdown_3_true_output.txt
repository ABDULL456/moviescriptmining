Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole. 
JEFF'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE 
The men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage, photography equipment, miscellaneous items. Inside the moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible, partially covered with a tarp. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean. 
RED So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off. 
There is a HAMMERING noise, O.S.    Red looks over, irritated. 
RED Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing? 
Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red. 
AL Figured I'd get started on the jewelry. 
RED Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us with the girl. 
INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT 
Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the knothole. 
INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal box, similar to a drawer in a morgue. 
They lift the metal lid, revealing -- 
CANVAS SACK 
The sack is stained and ripped.    Red pokes at it.   The sack doesn't move. Red shrugs. 
RED Must've died from the exhaust. 
INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT 
Jeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded.   Moisture forms in his eyes. 
INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift out the sack. 
RED I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out. 
Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly. 
AL (startled) Aagh! 
Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her screams muffled. 
INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT 
We see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive. 
INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Al gets to his feet, furious. 
AL Goddamn.   Scared me half to death. 
BILLY (chuckles) Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be more careful next time. 
AL Shut up. (glaring at Amy) Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her head off right now. 
ARLEEN (O.S.) (muffled) Warren? You in there? 
Red reacts. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RED Shit, it's my wife. Help me get her in the freezer. (calling out) Just a second, Arleen. 
Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a root cellar. 
AMY 
squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped, face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is visible in the knothole. 
Their gaze meets... and holds... 
RED 
returns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red peers into her terrified face. 
RED Don't   worry, honey. It's not as bad as   it sounds. It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out.    Probably won't even feel it. 
Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no match for the three men. 
BARN HAYLOFT 
Jeff watches helplessly as...

Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified. 
ROSE watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step closer to the boat. Husbands saying goodbye to wives and children. Lovers and friends parted. Nearby MOLLY is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat. 
MOLLY 
Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat, sister. 
RUTH 
Will the lifeboats be seated according to class? I hope they're not too crowded-- 
ROSE 
Oh, Mother shut up! 
(Ruth freezes, mouth open) 
Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. 
CAL 
Not the better half. 
PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is third class. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathing her face in white light. 
ROSE 
You unimaginable bastard. 
MOLLY 
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the first class seats right up here. That's it. 
Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for some other women who might need a push. 
MOLLY 
Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'. 
Rose steps back, shaking her head. 
RUTH 
Rose, get in the boat! 
ROSE 
Goodbye, mother. 
Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Rose and grabs her again, roughly. 
CAL 
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat? 
ROSE 
I'd rather be his whore than your wife. 
He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward the lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Lower away!! 
RUTH 
Rose! ROSE!! 
MOLLY 
Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She'll be along. 
The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out. 
TRACKING WITH ROSE, as she runs through the clusters of people. She looks back and a furious Cal is coming after her. She runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men. 
ROSE 
That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd! 
Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the two men grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance. 
Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs into a knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them... 
CUT TO: 
178 INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / STAIRCASE / A-DECK FOYER 
Cal runs in, and down to the landing, pushing past the gentlemen and ladies who are filling up the stairs. He scans the A-deck foyer. Rose is gone. 
CUT TO: 
179 EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC / BOAT 6 
The hull of Titanic looms over Boat 6 like a cliff. Its enormous mass is suddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, at the tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his two seamen can't row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing. 
HITCHINS 
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull. 
MOLLY 
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done. 
She climbs over Ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her feet. 
Around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in the water, others being lowered. 
CUT TO: 
180 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR 
Jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength. It's not budging. He hears gurgling sound. Water pours under the door, spreading rapidly across the floor. 
JACK 
Shit. 
He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin is raw... no good. 
JACK 
Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?! 
(to himself) 
This could be bad. 
181 THE CORRIDOR outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep. Jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hear it. 
CUT TO: 
182 INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR 
Thomas Andrews is opening stateroom doors, checking that people are out. 
ANDREWS 
Anyone in here? 
Rose runs up to him, breathless. 
ROSE 
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?! 
ANDREWS 
What? You have to get to a boat right away! 
ROSE 
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. 
ANDREWS 
(beat) 
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right. 
ROSE 
Bottom, left, right. I have it. 
ANDREWS 
Hurry, Rose. 
CUT TO: 
183 INT. FOYER / ELEVATORS 
Rose runs up as the last Elecator Operator is closing up his lift to leave. 
OPERATOR 
Sorry, miss, lifts are closed-- 
Without thinking she grabs him and shoves him back into the lift. 
ROSE 
I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the rest of my life! Now take me down!!

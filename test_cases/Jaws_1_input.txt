QUINT Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- (throws him some rope) Here. Tie me a sheepshank. 
Hooper ties the knot effortlessly. 
HOOPER I don't need to pass basic seamanship. 
QUINT Let me see your hands... 
He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and feels them as he talks. 
QUINT Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. 
HOOPER Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... 
BRODY (interrupting) Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... 
QUINT What do you mean 'We...?' 
BRODY It's my charter. My party. 
QUINT All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... (indicates Hooper) ...along for ballast. 
BRODY You got it. 
EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING 
The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check list as Quint takes them aboard. 
QUINT 5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons... 
As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he signs for his issue. 
HOOPER Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage... 
CLOSE - ON HOOPER AND RESEARCH ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You got everything you asked for? 
HOOPER All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for me. And tell Borack I'll catch up with them in New Zealand. 
ASSISTANT This is actually a killing expedition? 
HOOPER An eye for an eye, you know. 
QUINT Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. 
HOOPER (to Assistant) I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. 
Hooper sees his gear approaching. 
ANGLE ON DOCK AND ORCA 
Quint sees Hooper approaching with the large cage. 
QUINT Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? (to himself) Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? 
HOOPER Anti-Shark cage. 
QUINT Who's inside, you or the shark? 
Hooper indicates "me." 
QUINT You're in the cage? (Hooper nods) The cage is in the water? (Hooper nods) The shark is in the water too? (Hooper nods) You're in the water with the shark. 
Hooper nods. Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself. 
HOOPER Comin' aboard... 
ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING 
She's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's wearing shiny new foul weather gear, bundled up, sweaty, uncomfortable. 
She gives him as good a hug as she can manage under the circumstances. 
ELLEN Did you take your dramamine? (Brody nods) Here. 
She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to carry aboard with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint whistles derisively. 
QUINT Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'. 
ELLEN Is that him? 
BRODY (to Ellen) Colorful, isn't he?

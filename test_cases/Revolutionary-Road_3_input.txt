He stands.    April stands up too, smoothing her skirt. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Listen, though, April; this was really nice... I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don't know when I've ever had a -- a nicer breakfast. 
APRIL Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it too. 
They stand there gazing at one another across the table. Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears. 
He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more. 
FRANK Then you don't -- You don't hate me, or anything? 
APRIL No; of course I don't. 
She comes over to him. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Have a good day. 
He leans down and kisses her tenderly.   They look at one another a moment longer. 
FRANK Okay, then... So long. 
He steps through the door. She catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen. 
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. 
April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive. 
INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING. 
Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway. 
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. 
April sees Frank looking back at her.    She waves.   Frank waves from the car and drives off... 
Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill. She turns and looks back at the house. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING. 
April enters through the screen door and goes to the table. She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it aside. 
She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them. 
Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. And then there is no stopping the tears... 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. 
April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials. 
APRIL Hello... Milly? Everything all right? My voice sounds what...? 
April uses both hands to grip the receiver. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better... If it's not an inconvenience for you... This evening would be great. What...? Oh, well- no, not if they're outdoors playing. Don't call them in. 
The cigarette shreds in April's hand. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly. Thanks. 
She hangs up and begins to cry again.   Takes a breath. 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. 
FOOTSTEPS... 
We move behind April as she walks through the silent house. 
The distant SOUND of children playing outside.

{"train": "DARKMAN \nWritten by \nJoshua & Daniel Goldin, Sam & Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer \nFebruary 1989 \nINT. PIER BUILDING - DAY \nBANG!! A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit \nCLOSE SHOT: A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back. \nBLACK Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness. \nBLACK No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching. \nCONTINUED \n1 CONTINUED \nMAN They're drivin' up. Black nods. \nBLACK Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those fuckers. \n2 EXT WHARF - DAY We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront. \n3 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANT is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty. \n4 SLOW TRACKING - RUDY GUZMAN wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has been broken several times from his years in the Mexican boxing league. He was almost a contender. \n5 SLOW TRACKING - SKIP NATICK walks with a pronounced limp. \n6 SLOW TRACKING - TRUMAYNE JOHNSON MC SAM is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool. \n7 SLOW TRACKING - RICK is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows. \nB SLOW TRACKING - SMILEY 8 wears a permanent psychotic smile. \n9 SLOW TRACKING - PAULY 9 is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips. \n10 SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN 10 has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth. 11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11 Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies. Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're ready to kick some ass. \nDOCK WORKER Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it. \nDOCK WORKER #2 Bunch a cuties. \nDOCK WORKER #3 Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one. From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up in silence. \n13 INT PIER BUILDING -- NIGHT 13 As the visitors are led in, into the beams of the car headlights, escorted by the dock workers. The Dock Workers take up positions around Durant and his men. \n14 BLACK stands waiting for them. He eyes Skip, the limper. \nBLACK Bum leg? \nSKIP No leg. \nBLACK \n(CONVERSATIONALLY) I was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once. Skip brightens. \nSKIP \n(INTERESTED) Yeah? What happened? \nBLACK I hadda break it off. \n15 The dock workers laugh. Black indulges his wens' laughter, then cuts \nBLACK okay, let's cut the crap here. Durant, I got just three things to say to you. One He holds up a chubby finger. \nBLACK I ain't selling my property. He flashes a second finger. \nBLACK Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a bunch of fucks. He flashes a third finger. \nBLACK \nPPY Number three, if you guys is unha with that, which I can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that'll be more satisfactory. \n19 CONTINUED The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now...total silence. \nROBERT G. DURANT the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black: \nDURANT Now let's consider my points, one by one... \nGUZMAN puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant. \nDURANT One... He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer. \nDURANT .1 try not to let my anger get the better of me. SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger: \nDURANT ...Two: I don't always succeed. SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger: \nDURANT ...Three: I've got seven more points. \n2 0 EXT WHARF - DAY - LONG SHOT Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear Black's screams. \nCUT TO: \nPEYTON Pacing, thinking; \nPEYTON Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment. \nYAKITITO posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets. \nYAKITITO We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets. \nYAKITITO And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED \n32 CONTINUED \nYAKITITO But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs. \nPEYTON A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object --- \nBAM! He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech. \nYAKITITO Maybe I am lousy scientist. \nMAYBEOI listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget I am failure! \nPEYTON Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to \nCAMERA. \nYAKITITO Catches the ball. \nPEYTON The most striking characteristic of thermionic emission. \nYAKITITO Throws the ball away. \nYAKITITO \nKE No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down! I no want to calm down! \nCONTINUED \n32 CONTINUED(3) \nPEYTON catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito. \nPEYTON The answer, Yakitito. \nYAXITITO snags the ball angrily from the air. \nYAKITITO \n(FURIOUS) It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball. \nPEYTON Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches. \nYAKITITO This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks. \nYAKITITO Amazing. It work every time. \nCUT TO: \n33 INT. HUNT CLUB LOBBY- DAY \nLOUIS STRACK SR., a no-nonsense octogenarian, and his son, LOUIS STRACK JR., a powerfully built, debonair fifty, stride into the lobby. They are accompanied by a couple of aides. \nCONTINUED \n33 CONTINUED JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a briefcase. \nJULIE Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation. \nSTRACK JR. How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction. \nSTRACK SR. I don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating. Where's Herb Gorson? \nJULIE Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework. \nSTRACK SR. scowls, ungraciously accepting her. \nSTRACK SR. \n(TO JULIE) I'll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker's price down to sixty million... He turns and starts striding down the hallway, the others following. \nSTRACK SR. .If he goes that low, lock him up. \n34 INT HUNT CLUB PRIVATE DINING. ROOM - DAY The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large picture window that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured equestrians gallop past in the distance. Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz. Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee. \nKATZ We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price. \nPLEASANTLY: \nJULIE Then I guess we're only missing one element here. \nKATZ What's that? \nJULIE An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around. \nJULIE .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED \n-A \n34 CONTINUED Katz leans forward, listening. \n37 CONTINUED As he rummages in a drawer: \nYAKITITO So, did you ask her? \nPEYTON Tonight. Out of habit, Peyton glances back to the microscope. \nYAKITITO This is unbelievable! You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her! Maybe I ask to marry you. \nPEYTON Your father would never approve of me. Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement. Then: \nYAKITITO 216, no, I ask he if gbg marry you. I Peyton looks through the microscope; \n38 MICROSCOPE POV The cells still pulsate with life. \n39 PEYTON \nCRIES OUT; \nPEYTON Time, Yakitito! \nYAKITITO Huh?! One hundred minute! Peyton grips at the table with excitement. \nPEYTON The cells are holding, Yakitito. \nCONTINUED \nCONTINUED' \n41 CONTINUED \nPEYTON \n(SMILING) Okay, Yakitito, you made your point...Yakitito-- Yakitito is out of control. \nYAKITITO Dr. Westlake punch the wall! Dr. Westlake punch the wall! \nPEYTON \n(CONCERNED) Quickly .The function of sinusoidal currents in electrogenesis? The basketball appears in Yakitito's hands. \nYAKITITO You Punch You answer the quesiton. flinches, to c ch t winds back to toss u B e i ball pump -faked to cat ch t he ball. t ever comes-- Yakitito \nT N \nCUT TO: \n42 INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 42 \nTrolling through the city. In the back Strack Sr. and Strack Jr., both reading financial papers. We hold on the two men for a long time. Their utter stillness and silence grows unsettling. Finally: \nSTRACK JR. Gold Kugerands are looking attractive. Another long pause. \nSTRACK SR. Are those the ones with the chocolate centers? Another pause. \nSTRACK JR. \n(DRILY) Gold currency, father, as you know. And yet another pause. \nSTRACK SR. Krugerrands. Sounds like a frog trying to burp. Strack Industries will stick with real estate. You remember that. \n43 THE LIMO 43 suddenly glides into a rundown Texaco station. \n44 INT LIMOUSINE - TEXACO STATION - DAY 44 \nSTRACK SR. What the hell! \nDRIVER We have a flat, sir. I'm sorry. \nSTRACK SR. You should be. This'll come out of your wages. \n45 EXT. LIMOUSINE \nThe driver gets out and stoops to examine the tire. \nTHE TIRE is'NOT flat. \nTHE DRIVER discretely removes a straight-razor from his coat pocket and approaches the tire. \n46 INT. LIMOUSINE \nAfter a pause, Strack Sr. rises heavily to his feet. \nSTRACK SR. Time I took a leak anyway. Damn prostate. There's only one thing I gotta do myself and I gotta do it twenty times a day. Strack Sr. exits the car. \n47 EXT. LIMOUSINE \nStrack Sr. bends to examine the tire. \nTHE TIRE is now deflated. \nSTRACK SR. ments room.

CAMERA MOVES \nBACK TO... \nVOICE In the case of these two--a rare phenomenon--it lasted twenty years. \nJULIE Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset and distorted music. \nVOICE \nTUA Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image. \nVOICE Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table. \nVOICE The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling. Julie laughs. \nCONTINUED \n52 CONTINUED(4) \nVOICE Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate. \nJULIE Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax. \nVOICE The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle holder. \nQUIETLY; \nJULIE I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic. \nVOICE Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it. \nVOICE This song was playing when the two first kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they have been caught kissing. \nVOICE Now let us leave our test-subjects. The sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades away. \nCONTINUED \n52 CONTINUED(5) \nVOICE Love. It's fundamental nature still eludes modern Science. Yet researchers across the globe continue to study this ancient and powerful phenomenon. Hoping one day, to unlock love's mystery. Credits come on. A Westlake/Yanagita Presentation. Etc. Peyton The lights in the lab come on. Julie turns around. steps out from behind the slide projector. \nPEYTON Pretty stupid, huh? \nJULIE I thought it was beautiful- \nPEYTON Yakitito helped.

He strokes her hair. \nCUT TO: \n55 INT WESTLAKE LAB - MORNING 55 Sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto Julie's shoulder. She sits on the bed going over some papers, her expression increasingly disturbed. Julie punches a number into the phone. \nJULIE .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her. \nJULIE Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then: \nJULIE Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back. \nJULIE .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton. \nCONTINUED \n(Revised Scene is 2-17-89) \n55 CONTINUED Bye. I'll call l you tonight. Maybe we can get together. She exits. \nPEYTON The sound of the closing door echos. He sits alone on the ksd, looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond. \n56 EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING 56 \nJULIE In an impressive corporate power suit, briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her.. \n57 PEYTON 57 Dressed in jeans and sweatshirt, hurries to catch up to her. \nPEYTON Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door when she turns to him. \nJULIE What's the matter? \nPEYTON I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married. \n58 JULIE 58 Freezes half in and half out of the cab door. Panicked. \n58 CONTINUED \nJULIE Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own \nPLACE -- \nPEYTON 'We're practically living together now. All marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother, it's a wrong number. The poor woman's beginning to think she has alzheimer's. \nJULIE \nSTRACK (CONT'D) not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development. \nSTRACK Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well... \n(BEAT) .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law, but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises. \nJULIE All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings. \nSTRACK Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility. \nCONTINUED \n67 CONTINUED(3) Julie smiles. \nJULIE I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did-- \nSTRACK It isn't safe to have that document. \nJULIE Are you threatening me? \nSTRACK moves closer, touching her arm. \nSTRACK I'm trying to protect you. Does. (He hesitates, pursing st her.) his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you? \nJULIE He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. \nSTRACK \nA And real-estate. Robert Durant is competitor for the river-front and knows about that document. He is a criminal, Julie. And he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants. There's a pause. \nJULIE \nAND Well, you're very eloquent, frankly I'm not certain what I should do. You'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out. \nCONTINUED \n67 CONTINUED(4) \nSTRACK Is that the most I can extract from you? \nFIRMLY: \nJULIE For now. \nSTRACK I believe it is.

Every day-- \nPEYTON Time, Yakitito. \nYAKITITO It still ninety six minute! Sounds to me that maybe you didn't ask her. Maybe your afraid? \nPEYTON Look, I asked her. She said no, okay? Well, she actually said \"I don't know\". Peyton stands and stretches.

He drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles WHIZZING past his head. Like a marionette, he's jerked back up right in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is grazed by the car's hood.

On the way down it slaps against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels away again.

Brandy? \nJULIE Thank you, no. \nSTRACK I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink. \nSTRACK ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good-- \nJULIE Louis, I can't see you anymore. \n", "test3_true": "CONTINUED \n384 CONTINUED \nJULIE You know about Peyton, the man I was \nSEEING-- \nSTRACK \nOF COURSE-- \nJULIE Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down. \nSTRACK .Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs. \nSTRACK ... Where is he, Julie? \nJULIE He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up. \nSTRACK Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie. \nCONTINUED \nI \n384 CONTINUED(2) \nSTRACK I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone. \nSTRACK Yes, Franz... And the closing price?... \nJULIE She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is. \nHER POV Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk. \nJULIE Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer. \nSTRACK (OS) I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy... \nJULIE'S POV A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase. \nCLOSE ON THE PAPERS A dark coffee stain. \nBACK TO JULIE As she pulls the papers from the briefcase. \nCONTINUED \n384 CONTINUED(3) \nSTRACK (OS) Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones! \nCLOSE ON THE PAPERS \nMEMO: FROM THE DESK OF LOUIS STRACK SR. \nTO: CLAUDE BELASARIOUS \nSTRACK'S VOICE Yes. The Belasarious memorandum. \nJULIE whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her shoulder. \nSTRACK .I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain. \nJULIE The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you. \nSTRACK Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes. \nJULIE \n(QUIET) And now you'll kill me. Strack_ spreads his arms. \nSTRACK Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. (A beat). Julie. Consider the big picture. \nCONTINUED \n387 CONTINUED \nSTRACK I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door. \n388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then he hits a button on his desk-top intercom. \nSTRACK Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at his rising city. OS the door clicks open. \nROBERT G. DURANT enters the room. \nI STRACK Robert! I have good news and bad. \nDURANT Custom dictates that you render the bad news first. \nSTRACK You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us. \nDURANT No problem at all. And the good news? \nSTRACK Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor. \nCONTINUED \n"}

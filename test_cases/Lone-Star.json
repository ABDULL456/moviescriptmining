{"train": "LONE STAR \n\"LONE STAR\" \nBy \nJohn Sayles \nEXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY \nTwo men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as SERGEANT \"MIKEY\" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a morning off to pursue their hobbies. \nCLIFF We got ocotillo, devil's walking stick--what's this stuff--it's that whattayoucallit--horse-crippler. \nMikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it in a canvas bag slung on his hip. \nMIKEY This place is a gold mine. \nCLIFF Lead mine. \nMIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off. \nMIKEY What? \nCLIFF It's a lead mine. \nMIKEY Right. \nCLIFF I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head. \nMIKEY You finding lots of cactus and shit? \nCLIFF It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas-- \nMIKEY (Puts headset on) Looks like a lot of cactus to me. \nCLIFF (Grumbles) Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear. \nMIKEY (Troubled) Cliff-- \nCLIFF You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore-- \nMIKEY Cliff-- \nCU MIKEY \nMIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls his headset off again-- \nMIKEY Cliff, you gotta look at this-- \nCliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g. \nCLIFF Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, right?  Pieces of eight from the Coronado expedition-- \nHe stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing \nCLIFF Jesus-- \nGROUND -- CU BONES \nSticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger. \nMIKEY (O.S.) Was Coronado in the Masons? \nEXT. ROAD -- DAY \nA distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County Sheriff's insignia on the side. \nINT. CAR \nWe see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees something up ahead. \nMUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the sergeants standing in the scrub. \nEXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES \nThe hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are visible now. \nWIDER \nCliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond him we see the Sheriff's car parked. \nSAM I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio. \nCLIFF This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction. \nSAM (Nods) I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work. \nCLIFF That ring-- \nSAM Masons been around a long while. \nMikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal detector. \nINT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE \nSweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains two GOOD OLD BOYS-- \nHOLLIS So Buddy walks up to the porch and there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' the dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife--he was the most hygienic of all the McHenrys-- \nThe breakfast companions are laughing already-- \nHOLLIS \"Fishbait,\" says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, \"What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?\" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, \"C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!\" \nFENTON (Laughing) Buddy Deeds. He had a way. \nHOLLIS He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. \"Old Fishbait,\" he says, \"never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it.\" \nMore laughter-- \nFENTON Won't be another like him. That boy of his doesn't come near it. You ask me, he's all hat and no cattle \nSAM (O.S.) Fellas-- \nWe WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed. \nHOLLIS Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man. \nFENTON He was a unique individual. \nSAM Yeah, he was that. \nWe sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father-- \nHOLLIS Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected. \nFENTON Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P-- \nSAM I heard there was a bit of a fuss. \nHOLLIS Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd. \nFENTON Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park? \nHOLLIS King wasn't Mexican, Fenton-- \nFENTON Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish-- \nSAM They were here first. \nFENTON Then name it after Big Chief Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa fella was. He had the Mexes beat by centuries. \nHOLLIS There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben-- \nSAM --Santiago. \nHOLLIS Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news-- \nFENTON They just wanted it to be one of theirs-- \nHOLLIS That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him. \nSam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems to be avoiding looking toward him. \nSAM That so? \nHOLLIS She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part. \nFENTON Tell that one, Hollis-- \nHOLLIS Hell, everybody heard that story a million times. \nSAM I'd like to hear it. Your version of it. \nSomething about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard. \nFENTON Go ahead, Hollis. \nCU HOLLIS \nHollis is hooked into it now-- \nHOLLIS The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- \nFENTON (O.S.) '57, 1 believe-- \nHOLLIS And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county. \nHe looks down at the table-- \nHOLLIS It was in here one night, back  when Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started right here in this booth. \nWe PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla-- underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957-- \nWADE (Grins) This beaner fare doesn't agree with me, but the price sure is right. \nWIDER \nHOLLIS Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning. \nSAM Right. \nHOLLIS Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well-- \nFENTON Your mother was a saint. \nHOLLIS --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation. \nSam nods, speaks softly-- \nSAM Won't be another like him. \nEXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE \nCOLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the sky behind him-- \nDEL --it's an honor for me to assume command of this unit, and I look forward to working with all of you. \nOFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they stand in formation-- \nDEL (O.S.) I'm sure you're all aware of the Army's decision to close this installation under the Reduction in Force plan. That does not mean, however-- \nREVERSE \nWe look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs toward Del. \nDEL --that we've been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by another unit. \nCU DEL \nDEL You may have heard rumors that I run a very tight operation. These rumors are not exaggerated. \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO \nWe are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo. Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass. \nSECRETARY (O.S.) Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the paper for you-- \nSam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down at the photo-- \nSAM Tell him I'll catch him later. \nCU PHOTOGRAPH \nAn old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all in uniform. \nSECRETARY (O.S.) He says he needs to talk to you before the ceremony, Sam. \nSam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close to look. \nSAM Tell him to try me tomorrow. \nEXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE \nMAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view. A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller. \nSECRETARY (O.S.) He thinks you're trying to duck him. \nCU SAM \nLooking at the photo, troubled-- \nSAM (Mutters) He's right. \nEXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN \nWe start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC blasts from inside. \nEXT. DOORWAY -- CHET \nCHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges in. \nINT. BIG O'S \nWe TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees... \nCHET'S POV -- OTIS \nSeen through the crush is OTIS \"BIG O\" PAYNE, a large man in his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar. \nCHET \nHe nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes forward to get a better view. \nCHET'S POV -- OTIS \nMoving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns-- \nCHET \nReaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor. \nCU PRINCIPAL \nWeary-- \nPRINCIPAL Would you people like to form another committee? \nGROANS from the parents-- \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW \nShadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in through the door to be booked. \nSHADOW I hope the sucker does die, man! Mess with me, that's what you get! \nSam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction. \nRAY Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- \nSAM (Glances ahead) The shooter local? \nRAY (Shakes his bead) Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before. \nSAM Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club. \nRAY Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today? \nSAM Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later. \nAs Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the station, passing right by Sam without seeing him. \nCU SAM \nWonders what she's doing there-- \nSAM'S POV -- PILAR \nShe stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light. \nSAM (O.S.) Pilar. \nPILAR AND SAM \nPilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there is some history between these two. \nSAM Something wrong? \nPILAR They've got my Amado. \nSAM Got him here? \nPILAR Somebody called--something about an electronics store. \nSAM I'll see what's going on. \nHe starts away, stops, comes back-- \nSAM I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since. \nPILAR We haven't talked since high school. \nSAM Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. \nPilar watches Sam go-- \nREAR OF OFFICE \nTravis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in tears, gives testimony. \nATHENA --so Richie just didn't say nothin' 'cause he didn't want to get into it, see, and the next thing I know there's shots and Richie is down. It happened so fast-- \nSAM (O.S.) Excuse me-- \nWe WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk-- \nSAM We got some boys you run in earlier today? \nTRAVIS Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs at Pico Bernal's place. We finally caught them with something. \nSAM You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz? \nTravis looks at his booking sheets-- \nTRAVIS Yeah--let's see--the other ones say he wasn't in on the theft, he just knows how to hook things up. We've been trying to contact a parent. \nINT. JAIL HALLWAY \nSam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant-- \nSAM They tell me you're good at fixing things. \nNothin-- \nSAM Your father was a hell of a mechanic. \nSAM Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down. \nThey shake, Sam sits. \nBEN How's business? \nSAM Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated. \nBEN I hear they're closing that post down. \nSAM September '97, that's all she wrote. \nBEN Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county. \nSAM Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops. \nSam looks at the folder of reports. \nSAM That the word on our boy? \nBEN Yeah, this is Skinny. \nSAM Skinny? \nBEN We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones. \nSAM Nice job. \nBEN (Opens folder) Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records-- \nSAM Charley Wade. \nBEN (Nods) That badge-- \nSAM --it didn't come out of a cereal box. \nBEN Yeah. \nSAM You know the popular version of how he left town. \nBEN Everybody on the border knows that story. \nSAM You got a cause of death? \nBEN Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on. \nSAM So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack. \nBen smiles, closes the folder-- \nBEN You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm? \nSAM Colt Peacemaker. \nBEN A .45-- \nSAM He swore by it. (Ben frowns) What? \nBEN Just wondering. \nSAM So is Buddy on your short list? \nBEN If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen. \nSAM You got to investigate. No question about it. \nBEN What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old. \nSAM Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail. \nThey sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about it. \nBEN I remember Charley Wade come to my father's hardware store once when I was a little boy. I'd heard stories how he shot this one, how he shot that one--man winked at me and I peed in my pants. (Shakes his head) Winked at me. \nINT. CLASSROOM -- DAY \nPilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century Texas history. \nPILAR Okay, we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till they're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared. Anglo settlers are invited-- \nCU DRAWING \nSomebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g. \nPILAR (O.S.) --to colonize the area and by the time they begin the movement against Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans here by four to one. The war between Mexico-- \nCHET \nDrawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb over the corner. \nPILAR (O.S.) and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 with the formation of the Texas Republic. Texas joins the United States as a state where slavery is legal in 1845-- \nNOTEBOOK \nWADE Whoah, son. You're not finished. Pour his. \nYOUNG HOLLIS I prefer it in the bottle-- \nWADE Shut up, Hollis. Pour. \nOtis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer-- \nWADE How come you don't took familiar? \nYOUNG OTIS Been away. Up to Houston. \nWADE Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there. \nNo response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap-- \nWADE Aw--look what you done now. Better get something to wipe it up, son. \nHalf the people in the room are watching now, the other half moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on his temper, looks around the room-- \nYOUNG OTIS You spilt it, you wipe it up. \nWade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose-- \nWADE I told you to do something. Are you gonna hop to it, or are we gonna have a problem? \nOtis is starting to shake, but holds his ground-- \nWADE Don't want to turn tail in front of your people. I understand. \nHe starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at his face-- \nWADE Come on, Houston, give it a try! Come to Poppa-- \nRODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, petrified-- \nRODERICK Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it-- \nWADE That the problem, son?  You Slow? \nRODERICK Otis, apologize to the Sheriff-- \nOtis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything-- \nRODERICK You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up-- \nWADE You telling me what to do, Roderick? \nRODERICK No, Sheriff, I'm just-- \nWade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise-- \nWADE What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law-- \nRODERICK This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here-- \nWADE And people better clear out of here! Now! \nA few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look Otis in the face-- \nCU WADE \nWADE You learn how to act your place, son. This idn't Houston. \nHe stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar-- \nOTIS (V.O.) 'Course I was young and full of beans then-- \nThe camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95-- \nOTIS I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in. \nSAM And that was the last time you saw him? \nWe SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed-- \nOTIS Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope. \nSAM That was the night he disappeared? \nOTIS (Shakes his head) Could of been. That was white people's business. \nSAM And when my father was Sheriff? \nOTIS What about it? \nSAM What was your deal with him? \nOtis smiles, chooses his words carefully-- \nOTIS Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side. (Smiles) Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged. \nSAM He ever accept cash for a favor? \nWe TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her. \nCELIE (O.S.) I don't see what the big deal is. Go back over, talk to the man, and bury the hatchet, Del-- \nCELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings. We continue our SLOW TRACK forward-- \nDEL Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life. \nCHET Dad-- \nCELIE (O.S.) You were 8 years old when he left-- \nDEL He didn't leave, he moved three houses down with one of my mother's best friends. \nCHET Dad--? \nDEL \"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?\" \nDel disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall-- \nDEL (O.S.) Everybody else's business. And everybody loved Big O-- \nDEL comes back out, empty-handed-- \nDEL Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink. \nCHET Dad, can I talk to you about track? \nCELIE (O.S.) People change. \nDEL Not that much. \nCHET Dad, I talked to the track coach-- \nDEL I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough-- \nCHET I have a B average. \nDEL How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point? \nCELIE (O.S.) We're going to have to see him. \nDEL No, we don't. \nDel steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated-- \nINT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE \nWe start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone on the way to the kitchen. \nENRIQUE Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll cross in the morning and then we'll have to wait--] \nMercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers-- \nMERCEDES Off the phone, by we've got people waiting. Andale! \nWe FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves through, kibbitzing the operation-- \nWAITRESS \nMercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be cooked. She isn't wearing gloves. \nMERCEDES Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere matar a mis clientes? [Where are your gloves? Stupid! You want to kill my customers?] \nShe continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, who is trying to stay out of the way-- \nMERCEDES These ones coming up are getting stupider every year. \nPILAR Maybe you're just getting less patient. \nMERCEDES If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan! \nPILAR Well, you hire illegals-- \nMERCEDES (Indignant) Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy. \nPILAR If you spent a little more time training them-- \nMERCEDES Did you come here to tell me how to run my business? \nPILAR No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up-- \nMERCEDES Why would I want to go there? \nPILAR Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon-- \nMERCEDES You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them. \nPilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out-- \nPILAR Mami, how old were you when my father-- \nMERCEDES He was killed. \nSAM She's done well for herself--on her own and all-- \nPILAR So she tells me three times a week. \nShe looks at him-- \nPILAR I thought you got through that pretty well. \nSAM They cooked the whole thing up without asking me. \nPILAR People liked him. \nSAM Most people did, yeah. \nPILAR I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I-- \nShe shrugs. \nPILAR I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know-- \nSAM Yeah. \nPILAR Weird what you remember. \nThey walk in silence a moment-- \nSAM Your boy, there-- \nPILAR Amado. \nSAM Nice-looking kid. \nPILAR He hates me. \nSAM No-- \nPILAR With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal. \nSAM Fernando did okay, and he dropped out-- \nPILAR Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars. \nSAM It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack. \nShe looks at him-- \nPILAR So why did you come back here, Sam? \nSAM Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me-- \nPILAR You don't want to be Sheriff. \nSAM I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows. \nPILAR It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own. \nSAM You've got your mother, your kids-- \nPILAR They've got me. Different thing. \nThey stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank-- \nSAM Remember this? \nPilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever memory it brings back-- \nPILAR I should get back. \nSAM Pilar-- \nPILAR Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam. \nShe waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at the water. \nRIVER SURFACE \nA little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR tossing bark into the river as YOUNG SAM sits on the bank beside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972-- \nYOUNG SAM You going to tell her? \nYOUNG PILAR You going to tell him? \nYOUNG SAM He doesn't need to know all my business. \nYOUNG PILAR He's gonna find out. \nYOUNG SAM So? What's he gonna do, arrest us? \nYoung Pilar frowns, tosses more bark-- \nYOUNG PILAR It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other. \nYOUNG SAM You believe that? \nWade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy, holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the flashlight up. \nSAM \nWe are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a FLASHLIGHT BEAM-- \nPATROLMAN (O.S.) Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba! Sam, squinting toward the light to see who it is, raises his hands over his head-- \nZACK (O.S.) Get that thing off 'im! He's one of ours-- \nSAM Zack? \nThe FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam-- \nZACK Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that. \nSAM What's up? \nZACK We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way. \nSAM I haven't seen anybody come by. \nZACK We'll get 'em-- (Looks around) So you livin' out here now? \nSAM Yeah. It's quiet-- \nZACK I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud. \nSAM Sure. \nZACK The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella-- \nPATROLMAN (O.S.) Zack! We got one! \nZACK Well--back on the clock. You see any of our neighbors from the south, let 'em know I'm lookin' for 'em. \nSAM 'Night-- \nZack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, goes back to chucking them-- \nEXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS \nOlder CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT UP to see Enrique watching from his window-- \nINT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nMUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window, and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil the rope--it is hundreds of feet long. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nPilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her-- \nPALOMA (O.S.) Mom? \nPILAR Yeah? \nPALOMA (O.S.) You gonna stay out here? \nPILAR For a while. \nA silence. They listen to the RECORD-- \nPALOMA (O.S.) What's she singing about? \nPILAR (Smiles) What do you think? \nFADE OUT \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING \nSam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from a report in front of him-- \nSAM First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage \nDOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS \nAs Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- Certificates of death.

SCHOOL -- MORNING \nPilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before school starts-- \nPILAR I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college-- \nAMADO I can't take any more school. \nPILAR --you're going to be on your own. \nAMADO So? \nPILAR So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends. \nAMADO They're not going to jail. \nPILAR Don't try to con me, Amado.

Don't even live here all year. \nPILAR That makes it okay? \nAMADO They stole our land-- \nPILAR Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me. \nA silence. Amado sulks. \nPILAR How do you think you're going to make a living? \nAMADO I can fix cars. \nPILAR You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized-- \nAMADO You think I can't learn that? \nPILAR I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for-- \nAMADO I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste. \nPILAR That isn't true. \nAMADO Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad-- \nPILAR If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled. \nThey look, at each other for a long moment. \nAMADO It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business. \nPILAR (Nods) I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age. \nAMADO And what did she do? \nPILAR Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help. \nAMADO Catholic school, nasty. \nPilar is nearly in tears. \nPILAR Honey, I think you're smart and you're good and I love you. So don't act like an idiot, all right? \nEXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY \nWe see Sam's car roll through the \"express lane\" as other cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam drives across the bridge over the Rio-- \nEXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS \nSam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15, aimlessly walking the streets-- \nEXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY \nELADIO Not much, jefe. Some watermelons. \nWADE I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road. \nELADIO I haven't seen anybody doing that. \nWADE This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo? \nELADIO Eladio Cruz. \nWADE You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio-- \nARROYO -- CHUCHO \nYoung CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening. \nELADIO Reputation? \nWADE Bandidos, Injuns-- \nCLOSER -- MEN \nHollis wanders over to stand by Wade-- \nWADE There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection. \nELADIO Protection? \nWADE You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now. \nELADIO Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- \nWADE Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that. \nELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified-- \nYOUNG HOLLIS Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord-- \nWADE Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service. Think he can make a fool out of Charley Wade! Get them wets outta the back, Hollis, see what we've got-- \nCU CHUCHO \nSquatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, eyes covered with his hands. \nYOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) You killed him-- \nWADE (O.S.) You got a talent for statin' the obvious, son Muchachos! Venga afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out! Hands up!] \nYoung CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks-- a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go-- \nEXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE \nSomebody has spray-painted \"PERDIDO!\" over the plaque of Buddy and the little boy-- \nHOLLIS (O.S.) Hooligans-- \nWIDER \nHollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department look at the damage. \nHOLLIS It happens again, we build a fence around it. \nINT. CAFE -- DAY \nEnrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS with him to a booth. \nZACK Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win a lot of battles but the war's already been lost--] \nZack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him-- \nCU ENRIQUE \nEyes glued to his notepad-- \nENRIQUE You wan' something to drink? \nEXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL \nA Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal against the Western sky-- \nWESLEY (O.S.) The longhorns go for ten times the price-- \nWe WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland surrounds them. \nWESLEY --but longhorns are hard to come by these days. \nSAM You sell much out here? \nWESLEY How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much. \nSAM Hell of a spot to put a business. \nWESLEY But you don't see much competition, do you? \nIt is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK to see that nobody is visible through the window-- \nBUDDY (O.S.) Let's go. \nWe FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open by their heads-- \nBUDDY Goddammit! \nBuddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other side-- \nYOUNG SAM What the hell are you doing? You fucking asshole! \nBUDDY How old is that girl? Goddammit, where's your goddam sense? \nYOUNG PILAR (O.S.) Let me go!  Pendejo! \nYOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) Come on now, Missy, get your clothes in order-- \nSam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING their HORNS all around-- \nYOUNG SAM You got no fuckin' right! You stay out of my fuckin' life! \nBUDDY Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn car keys, son-- \nYOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) What am I s'posed to do with her, Buddy? \nBUDDY You drive her home and tell her mother where we found her-- \nYOUNG PILAR (O.S.) Sam! \nThe kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying, struggling-- \nYOUNG SAM You leave her the fuck alone! \nBUDDY You just shut that filthy mouth, son. I'll deal with you when we get home-- \nYOUNG PILAR Please, don't tell my mother! She's gonna kill me! \nThey step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT the scene, then FADE. \nEXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK \nIt is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam, standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive- in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g. \nCU SAM \nRemembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls away. \nMARQUEE -- DUSK \nMUSIC CONTINUES as the car cruises out past the old marquee, a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around them. \nINT. CAR \nMUSIC CONTINUES as Sam drives, thinking-- \nEXT. ROADS -- VARIOUS SHOTS -- DUSK/NIGHT \nMUSIC CONTINUES as the car crosses the scrubland back toward town. DUSK turns to NIGHT-- \nEXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nMUSIC CONTINUES as Sam cruises past Pilar's house. The car is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple FRIENDS under the porch light, laughing-- \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT \nMUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot. He looks up toward the school-- \nEXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV \nMUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard-- \nINT. CAR \nMUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait-- \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nPILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next to hers. They look at each other for a long moment \nPILAR (Softly) Follow me. \nEXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT \nNothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night. \nINT. CAFE -- NIGHT \nSam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces \nPILAR We thought we were something, didn't we? \nSAM Yeah. \nPALOMA How come? \nPILAR Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys. \nPILAR steps out into the sun-- \nPALOMA Did it work? \nINT. CAFE -- MORNING \nHollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him-- \nSAM Morning, Hollis. \nHOLLIS Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something. \nSAM You thought any more about our murder? \nHOLLIS We have a murder? \nSAM Charley Wade. \nHOLLIS I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't. \nSAM I got an idea what happened. \nHOLLIS Do you? \nSAM I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back. \nHollis sits back to look Sam in the eye-- \nHOLLIS You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that? \nSAM I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight. \nSam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite gone-- \nEXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING \nChet steps around to the side entrance-- \nINT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE \nWe start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room. On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of feathers stuck in his headband \nOTIS (O.S.) That's John Horse. \nChet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the bar-- \nOTIS Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse. \nCHET (Looks at picture) He a Black man or an Indian? \nOTIS (Steps in) Both. \nOtis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up-- \nOTIS He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma-- \nCHET The Trail of Tears. \nOTIS (Smiles) They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee. \nCHET So they stayed in Florida? \nOTIS They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass. \nThey move on to some photos of very African-looking people dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing-- \nOTIS Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche-- \nCHET They fought against the Indians? \nOTIS Same as they done in Mexico. \nCHET But they were Indians themselves. \nOTIS They were in the Army. Like your father. \nCHET (Surprised) You know who I am? \nOTIS I got a pretty good guess. \nCHET That guy who got shot-- \nOTIS You didn't go telling your father you were here? \nCHET Are you kidding? And face a court- martial? \nOTIS (Smiles) He's a pretty tough old man, huh? \nCHET No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's-- \nDEL Chaos. \nAthena is sure she's overstepped her rank-- \nDEL Why do you think they let us in on the \"deal\"? \nATHENA They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us. \nDEL Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post? \nATHENA No, sir. Not at all. \nDEL Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers? \nATHENA No, sir. They all been real straight with me. \nDel stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her-- \nDEL It works like this, Private--every soldier in a war doesn't have to believe in what he's fighting for. Most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad--you try not to get them killed, try not to get them extra duty, try not to embarrass yourself in front of them. \nHe is right in her face now-- \nDEL Why don't you start with that? \nATHENA Yes, sir. \nDEL You're dismissed, Private. \nATHENA Thank you, sir. \nAthena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled by the encounter. \nEXT. BORDER CONTROL \nA battered car full of Mexican DAY WORKERS rolls toward the Mexican side checkpoint-- \nINT. CAR \nEnrique sits squeezed between workers in the back. The driver never stops talking as the officer waves them through. \nDRIVER (O.S.) --Julia es demasiado flaca para mime gusto mas mujeres con algo en frente-- o muy altas como Cindy Crofor. Quisiera montar esa caballa--[Julia's too skinny for me--I like women with something up front--or really tall like Cindy Crawford. I'd like to ride that horse--] \nEXT. KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY \nSam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive- looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood-- \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games-- \nBUNNY The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio-- \nSAM (O.S.) That's in Maverick County. \nShe brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full- sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler-- \nBUNNY Oh. Right. And you're in--? \nSAM Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore-- \nSAM You still going to all the home games? \nBUNNY Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6\", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press? \nSAM Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication? \nBUNNY Do I seem jumpy? \nSAM No, you look good. I was just wondering. \nBUNNY Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop-- \nSAM You look good-- \nBUNNY --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- \nSAM Yeah, well-- \nBUNNY --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her. \nSAM You were in a fight-- \nBUNNY Daddy calls it an \"altercation.\" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny. \nSAM Same weight I always was. \nBUNNY You look awful good in that uniform, though. \nSAM Best part of the job. \nBUNNY Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says \"Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now\". \nSAM Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there? \nDel squirm a bit at the word \"father\"-- \nDEL You've been in this house for a while? \nCAROLYN I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora. \nDEL I never met her. \nCAROLYN There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither. \nDel looks around the living room-- \nCAROLYN Let me show you around-- \nINT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH \nA blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted on the wall-- \nCAROLYN (O.S.) He got into all this cowboys and Indians stuff awhile back. Spend half his time pokin' around in the library way up to Austin. \nCU DEL \nHe looks at something below -- \nDEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS \nWe PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the Army-- \nCAROLYN (O.S.) Kind of like a shrine, isn't it? \nDEL, CAROLYN \nCarolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at the stuff-- \nDEL Where'd he get all this? \nCAROLYN Your mother got a brother--Alphonse-- \nDEL Uncle Al-- \nCAROLYN Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it. \nDEL I'm a colonel. \nCAROLYN Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all? \nDEL It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command. \nCAROLYN Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit. \nDEL My mother said he never asked about-- \nCAROLYN He never asked her. \nIt's a bit too much for Del-- \nDEL Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. Thanks-- \nWe HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes-- \nCAROLYN Catch you later, Colonel. \nEXT. RIVER -- NIGHT \nPEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps out of the darkness to join him-- \nENRIQUE Que Paso? [What happened?] \nNESTOR Anselma cayo en las rocas. Creo que la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma felt on the rocks. I think her leg's broken--] \nTwo men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of pain-- \nNESTOR No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando a ella. Hay lugar para esconderla? [We can't reach the truck if we're carrying her. Is there somewhere to hide her?] \nEnrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up around him-- \nENRIQUE Conozco solamente una persona con casa--[I only know one person with a house--] \nANSELMA (In pain) Esta lejos? [Is it far?] \nEXT. PATIO -- NIGHT \nMercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the dark-- \nENRIQUE (O.S.) Senora Cruz? \nMERCEDES (Standing) Quien es? [Who is it?] \nENRIQUE Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid] \nEnrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's scared-- \nMERCEDES What are you doing out there? Are you crazy? \nEXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES \nMercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old station wagon-- \nMERCEDES Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see! \nENRIQUE Donde vamos? [Where are we going?] \nMERCEDES A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it. \nENRIQUE Senora, anything it costs, I can work-- \nMERCEDES Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors. \nEnrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the station wagon-- \nENRIQUE Seas tranquila, mija. (Nods to Mercedes) Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. [Just relax, honey. We're in the hands of Senora Cruz.] \nMercedes starts the car-- \nMERCEDES In English, Enrique. In English-- \nINT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM \nDel steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment-- \nCARTOON \nA tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun blasting away-- \nDEL (O.S.) Homework? \nDEL AND CHET \nCHET I finished that. I'm just messing around. \nDEL Tanks, huh? \nCHET You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. \nDEL So you're going into the Army? \nChet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his drawing-- \nCHET That's the general plan, isn't it? \nDel watches for a long moment, thinking-- \nDEL (Softly) That's up to you. \nChet looks at his father again. All this is news to him-- \nDEL The Army isn't for everybody. \nChet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to the refrigerator-- \nDEL Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life. \nCHET You wouldn't? \nDEL No. \nChet nods, begins to play again, considering the possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have much practice-- \nDEL How's your room shaping up? \nCHET Fine. I'm pretty much moved in. \nDEL Good. \nAn awkward silence-- \nCHET (Tentative) Are we going to ever see your father? \nDEL My father. \nCHET Yeah. He lives here, right? \nDEL He does. \nDel pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws-- \nDEL Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over. \nCHET Cool. \nChet flips the page of his sketchbook-- \nCHET He makes his own sauce. \nEXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT \nThe neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches the door-- \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly-- \nINT. BARROOM \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis-- \nCLOSER \nMUSIC CONTINUES. \nCLOSER \nWade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him. Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar-- \nBAR COUNTER \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash onto the counter-- \nWADE \nMUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something behind Otis-- \nINT. BAR \nMUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind-- \nCIGAR BOX \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it. Young Otis reaches-- \nCU YOUNG HOLLIS \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong-- \nWADE \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio-- \nWADE'S HAND \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the \nHOLLIS \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror-- \nWADE \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims-- \nBUDDY \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT-- \nYOUNG OTIS \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy-- \nWADE \nBLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him back against the bar. \nMUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand-- \nYOUNG OTIS \nHorrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC CONTINUES-- \nBAR COUNTER \nMUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the envelope and are soaking up blood-- \nCU BUDDY \nCalm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis-- \nWe PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES-- \nOTIS Sheriff Charley had some real big friends in politics then, and if the truth come out it wasn't going to go easy on Hollis. (He shrugs) I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it--don't know why he trusted me. The first time I ever talked with him was right there, and then with a dead white man leakin' blood on the floor between us. He could charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy Deeds. \nWIDER \nThis isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face-- \nHOLLIS The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help. \nSAM And the ten thousand? \nHOLLIS Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late-- \nOTIS Time went on, people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been. \nSam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with-- \n", "test1_input": "INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA \nAthena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure-- \nCLIFF (O.S.) So you knew this young man before? \nATHENA From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street. \nPRISCILLA (O.S.) Did you know he was going to be there last night? \nATHENA If I had I wouldn't have gone in. \nPRISCILLA (O.S.) And you and Private Graves-- \nATHENA We were just dancing-- \nWIDER \nCliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them focused on Athena. \nPRISCILLA We're not running a dating service here. \nATHENA I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble. \nCLIFF It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here-- \nATHENA I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy-- \nA silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She works up her courage-- \nATHENA Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves? \nCLIFF He'll live. \nPRISCILLA He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized-- \nCLIFF He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- \nATHENA Out of the Army? \nCLIFF He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena-- \nATHENA Will this go on my record? \nCliff considers for a long moment-- \nCLIFF If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction. \nATHENA Thank you, Sergeant Major. \nCLIFF You're dismissed. \nATHENA Thank you, Sergeant Major. \nAthena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk-- \nPRISCILLA You spoil 'em, Cliff. \nCLIFF Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack-- \nPRISCILLA But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass. \nCLIFF She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood. \nCrossing to the door-- \nPRISCILLA And if she isn't careful she's gonna slide right back into it. \nEXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER \nWe start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS. \nMINNIE \nMINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car-- \nSAM Mrs. Bledsoe? \nMINNIE That's me. \nSAM I'm Sheriff Deeds-- \nMINNIE Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior. \nSAM (Smiles) Yeah, that's the story of my life. \nMINNIE You ever play one of these? \nSAM I've seen 'em. \nMINNIE Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone. \nSAM You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick? \n", "test1_true": "SAM He had the club out on the old trail road-- \nMINNIE We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April. \nSAM So you must remember Sheriff Wade. \nMINNIE Not if I can help it. \nSAM You had to deal with him in running the club. \nMINNIE Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for. \nSAM He squeezed money out of you? \nMINNIE Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, \"Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership.\" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime. \nSAM And my father? \nMINNIE Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite. \nSAM People didn't complain? \nMINNIE Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'. \nSAM Do you remember the last time you saw him? \nMinnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy-- \nMINNIE I seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin'. \nWe TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly-- \nMINNIE He used to come in whilst we was in full swing, make people nervous. Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ROADHOUSE -- \nThe joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table. \nYoung Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing R&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his early 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a tray with a couple beers and glasses over. \nMINNIE (V.O.) --just sit back with his hand on that big ol' gun and act the kingfish with everybody. Otis Payne had come to work for us by then, and that boy had him some attitude-- \nCU WADE \nWatching Young Otis with narrowed eyes-- \nCU WADE'S POV -- OTIS \nA man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back. Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away. \nWADE Pour it. \nOTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR- \nWADE Pour it. \nExpressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass. The Sheriff looks up into his face-- \nWADE I know you? \nYOUNG OTIS Name's Otis. \nWADE Otis what? \nYOUNG OTIS Payne. \nWADE One of Cleroe Payne's boys? \nYOUNG OTIS Uh-huh. \nWADE I sent your Daddy to the farm once. \nYOUNG OTIS I know that. \nWADE Why you think that was? \nOtis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face-- \nYOUNG OTIS Some crop needed pickin' and the man was shorthanded. \nA very insolent answer for the time and place-- \nWADE As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son? \nYOUNG OTIS Runnin' numbers illegal. \nWADE Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that. \nThe beer is poured. Otis starts away-- \n", "test1_id": 180, "test2_input": "CLIFF Seriously, I think we should get married. \nPRISCILLA We been through this before-- \nCLIFF We should just do it. \nPRISCILLA And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere-- \nCLIFF You could take it-- \nPRISCILLA It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post-- \nCLIFF I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that. \nPRISCILLA (Grins) Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal. \nSAM (O.S.) Excuse me-- \nThey look up to see Sam standing over them-- \nCLIFF Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth. \nSAM Pleased to meet you. \nCLIFF Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday. \nPRISCILLA It true they gonna build a shopping mall out there? \nSAM If certain people have their way, it's going to be a new jail. \nPRISCILLA Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong business. They closin' down military bases left and right, puttin' up jails like 7-11 stores. \nSAM Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range? \nCLIFF They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year. \nPRISCILLA You know who it was they dug up? \nSAM Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish they hadn't. \nEXT. CAFE -- NIGHT \nEnrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking car-- \nENRIQUE Es muy lindo, su coche-- \nMERCEDES En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English. \nENRIQUE Is very beautiful, your car. \nMERCEDES Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car-- \nENRIQUE Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction-- \nFADE OUT \nEXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL \nDel, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a handlettered sign next to it: \"BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR ENTRANCE.\" He steps in-- \nINT. ROADHOUSE \nLate-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for a moment, then Otis turns to call. \nOTIS Carolyn--knock that off for a minute. \nCAROLYN \nCAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at the newcomer-- \nBAR \nDel doesn't move to come closer-- \nDEL Black Seminoles? \nOTIS (Shrugs) Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission. \nDel nods toward where Carolyn is mopping-- \nDEL That where he was shot? \nOTIS That's where he fell. \nDEL You get much of that in here? \nOTIS It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- \nDEL Deal drugs in the bathroom-- \nOTIS If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. \nCarolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop-- \n", "test2_true": "DEL Nice to meet you, Ma'am. \nCarolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis-- \nCAROLYN I'll be in back waiting for that delivery. \nThey wail till she is gone to start again-- \nOTIS So. \nDEL So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits. \nOTIS This is an official visit, then-- \nDEL I assume a lot of your business is from our people. \nOtis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer. \nOTIS Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born. \nDEL We have an enlisted man's club at the post. \nOTIS Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call. \nDEL That's right. \nOTIS (Smiles) I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here. \nDEL The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is. \nOTIS Right. \nDEL I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown. \nOTIS (Shrugs) Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place. \nDEL And people make their choice-- \nOTIS (Smiles) A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other-- \nDel looks away, not wanting to believe this-- \nOTIS (Softly) I gonna meet that family of yours? \nDEL Why would you want to do that? \nOTIS Because I'm your father. \nDel gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between them. He gets up and heads for the door-- \nDEL You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out-- \nCAROLYN So that's him-- \nOTIS Yeah--that's him. Got two, three thousand people under him out there, you count the civilians. \nCAROLYN That must be a laugh a minute. \nEXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY \nSam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering at the other end for the ceremony-- \nH.L. (O.S.) Sheriff! \nWe WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam on the back-- \nH.L. Historic occasion, isn't it? \nSAM Seems like we have another one every week. \nH.L. Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'-- \nJORGE We're building up tourism, Sam-- \nSAM People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon-- \nJORGE Sam-- \nSAM You ought to put up a banner-- \"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy\"-- \nH.L. That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam. \nSAM Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue-- \nJORGE I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story. \nSAM The Perdido thing? \nJORGE He agreed it wasn't exactly news-- \nSAM Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time. \n", "test2_id": 181, "test3_input": "H.L. Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page. \nSAM We don't need a new jail. \nH.L. That's a matter of interpretation-- \nSAM We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow-- \nJORGE There was a mandate in the last election-- \nSAM It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters-- \nH.L. Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime-- \nSAM We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school-- \nJORGE There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail-- \nSAM Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail. \nH.L. When we backed you-- \nSAM When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks-- \nSam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis with a huge pair of scissors in her hand. \nCU MERCEDES \nSlowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly at Sam-- \nCU SAM \nHe nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him. \nSAM Let's get this thing over with. \nINT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING \nWe start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S bag \nMIKEY Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder. \nCLIFF I think it's beyond what you'd call dating. \nMIKEY You going to get married? \nCLIFF (Shrugs) Maybe. \nMIKEY You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy? \nCLIFF Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man-- \nMIKEY Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse. \nCliff picks up a slug-- \nCLIFF Hey, Mikey-- \nMIKEY I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- \nCLIFF Mikey-- \nMIKEY Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains-- \nCLIFF Mikey-- \nMIKEY If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine-- \nCLIFF Mikey look at this-- \nMIKEY What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here. \nCLIFF It's a .45. \nMIKEY Yeah? \nCLIFF This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber-- \nMIKEY They were using M-1's, yeah-- \nCLIFF What's it doing on a rifle range? \nMIKEY holds the slug in front of his face-- \nMIKEY We better call that Sheriff. \nEXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY \nHollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a good mood. \nHOLLIS Sometime in the early '70s a reporter from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our Lone Star state, and he asked him, \"Governor, what's your ideal of what a real Texan ought to be?\" Governor said, \"That's easy, son- you just go down to Rio County and get a look at Sheriff Buddy Deeds.\" \nApplause-- \n", "test3_true": "Watching the crowd-- \nSAM'S POV \nWe PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a few yards back-- \nHOLLIS (O.S.) Thank you. We've got one more person to hear from-- \nHOLLIS \nHOLLIS --and he's somebody who probably knew Buddy better than any of us, Sam--would you say a few words? \nSAM \nNot thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly to APPLAUSE-- \nSAM You folks who remember my father knew him as Sheriff. But at home he was also judge, jury \nHe looks to Hollis-- \nSAM --and executioner. \nLAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before continuing-- \nSAM This is a real honor you're doing him today, and if Buddy was around I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' bigger every minute. \nPILAR \nWatching-- \nSAM (O.S.) I used to come to this park to hide from him. Now that you're putting his name on it-- \nSAM \nSAM I'll have to find someplace new to duck out. \nMore LAUGHTER-- \nSAM I do appreciate it, and wherever he is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice for the bunch of you. Thank you. \nAPPLAUSE-- \nSam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors without looking at him-- \nHOLLIS And now my fellow Council member and one of Frontera's most respected businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, will do the honors for us. \nMERCEDES \nShe freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that lets the cloth drop-- \nSTATUE \nThe cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a block of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully. \nAPPLAUSE from the gathering-- \nSAM \nWatching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue-- \nBYSTANDER 1 (O.S.) It does look like old Buddy. \nBYSTANDER 2 (O.S.) Runnin that kid in for loiterin'-- \nThe bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes as she steps away-- \nSAM Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz. \nMercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching. \nSAM \nSteps over from the dispersing crowd-- \nSAM Field trip? \nPILAR Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty. \nSAM Want to take a walk? \nEXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY \nSam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio-- \nSAM Your mother still doesn't like me. \nPILAR I can't name anybody she does like these days. \nSAM I see she built a place up here by the river. \nPILAR A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing-- \n", "test3_id": 182}

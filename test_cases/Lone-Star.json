When I was little--before you and I-- \nShe shrugs. \nPILAR I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know-- \nSAM Yeah. \nPILAR Weird what you remember. \nThey walk in silence a moment-- \nSAM Your boy, there-- \nPILAR Amado. \nSAM Nice-looking kid. \nPILAR He hates me. \nSAM No-- \nPILAR With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal. \nSAM Fernando did okay, and he dropped out-- \nPILAR Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars. \nSAM It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack. \nShe looks at him-- \nPILAR So why did you come back here, Sam? \nSAM Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me-- \nPILAR You don't want to be Sheriff. \nSAM I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows. \nPILAR It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own. \nSAM You've got your mother, your kids-- \nPILAR They've got me. Different thing. \nThey stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank-- \nSAM Remember this? \nPilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever memory it brings back-- \nPILAR I should get back. \nSAM Pilar-- \nPILAR Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam. \nShe waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at the water. \nRIVER SURFACE \nA little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and drifts away with the current.

What's he gonna do, arrest us? \nYoung Pilar frowns, tosses more bark-- \nYOUNG PILAR It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other. \nYOUNG SAM You believe that? \n", "test1_true": "She turns to look at him-- \nYOUNG PILAR No. \nWe PAN with her gaze to see Sam, PRESENT DAY, sitting on the bank, lost in thought-- \nSAM Me neither. \nEXT.

Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too. \nATHENA (Reacts) You're testing me? \nPRISCILLA You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals.

SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nRay Hernandez and another DEPUTY guide Shadow back in from the courthouse in handcuffs-- \nRAY Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed. \nSHADOW You don't need to cuff me. \nRAY You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now-- \nThey guide him past Sam's desk-- \nSHADOW You're the one who's a good boy. Man say \"fetch\" and you fetch-- \nRAY Just doing my job. \nSHADOW White man just using you to keep the Black man down. \nRAY This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come. \nSHADOW You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo. \nRay smiles, pushes him out-- \nRAY Andale, amigo, \nWe HOLD on Sam at his desk, TIGHTENING as he holds the .45 slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes-- \nSAM Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin-- \nINT. MERCEDES' KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- CU GLASS \nWe hear old MEXICAN MUSIC.

BACK PATIO -- NIGHT \nThe back LIGHT is flicked on and Mercedes steps out with her drink in hand, the MUSIC audible from inside. She sinks into a recliner. We TIGHTEN as she closes her eyes. Something RUSTLES out In the dark. Mercedes opens her eyes. There is WHISPERING. Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. Mercedes sighs-- \nMERCEDES Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks again--] \nMercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, punches a number in-- \nMERCEDES Hello? Border Patrol? \nEXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nSam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the night sounds. \nCU SAM \nWorking something out in his head. He looks off into the dark and we PAN with his gaze--A MAN steps toward us, barely visible in the darkness. It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's REVERIE, in 1957-- \nWADE Who is that? Come out here where I can see you! \nBLAM! A GUNSHOT, and Wade falls to his knees-- \nWADE You sonofabitch-- \n", "test1_id": 180, "test2_input": "DEL Chaos. \nAthena is sure she's overstepped her rank-- \nDEL Why do you think they let us in on the \"deal\"? \nATHENA They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us. \nDEL Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post? \nATHENA No, sir. Not at all. \nDEL Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers? \nATHENA No, sir. They all been real straight with me. \nDel stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her-- \nDEL It works like this, Private--every soldier in a war doesn't have to believe in what he's fighting for. Most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad--you try not to get them killed, try not to get them extra duty, try not to embarrass yourself in front of them. \nHe is right in her face now-- \nDEL Why don't you start with that? \nATHENA Yes, sir. \nDEL You're dismissed, Private. \nATHENA Thank you, sir. \nAthena salutes, steps out.

KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY \nSam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive- looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood-- \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games-- \nBUNNY The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio-- \nSAM (O.S.) That's in Maverick County. \nShe brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full- sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler-- \nBUNNY Oh. Right. And you're in--? \nSAM Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore-- \nSAM You still going to all the home games? \nBUNNY Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6\", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press? \nSAM Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication? \nBUNNY Do I seem jumpy? \nSAM No, you look good. I was just wondering. \nBUNNY Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop-- \nSAM You look good-- \nBUNNY --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- \nSAM Yeah, well-- \nBUNNY --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her. \nSAM You were in a fight-- \nBUNNY Daddy calls it an \"altercation.\" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny. \nSAM Same weight I always was. \nBUNNY You look awful good in that uniform, though. \nSAM Best part of the job. \nBUNNY Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says \"Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now\". \nSAM Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there? \n", "test2_true": "SAM No. You? \nBUNNY Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead. \nSAM You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's-- \nBUNNY You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it? \nSAM Suppose not. \nBUNNY You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound-- \nSAM It wasn't just you, Bunny. \nBUNNY No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you? \nShe looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment-- \nBUNNY Your shit's still in the garage if that's what you came for. \nSam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears-- \nBUNNY 350 pounds. \nSAM What? \nBUNNY This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow. \nSAM I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter. \nBUNNY \"I only got my little girl now,\" he says, \"she's my lifeline.\" Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people. \nSAM (Edging out) You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you. \nBUNNY (Smiles) Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam. \nEXT. STREET -- CIUDAD LEON \nEnrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping into a funky apartment building. We TILT up to the second floor balcony, where a LITTLE BOY is watching the street-- \nINT. APARTMENT \nThere are eight PEOPLE not including the little boy on the balcony. All are securing their possessions--rolling things in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks. Enrique steps in-- \nENRIQUE Todos estamos?

We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it and the legend--\"ONE GOOD DEEDS DESERVES ANOTHER--VOTE SAM DEEDS FOR COUNTY SHERIFF\". We PAN to see Sam, who has been digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was looking for-- \nCLOSER \nSam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns. He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark-- pulls a letter out, reads-- \nSAM \"Dearest Buddy--\" \nHe puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to know. He picks the letter up again, reads. \nINT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING \nCarolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the front door.  Del stands there-- \nCAROLYN Hey, it's the General. \nDEL Colonel.

OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING \nCarolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del out-- \nCAROLYN Otis sittin' up with some people at the club. I don't think he'll be long. \nCU DEL \nUncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot sauce on a rack of ribs-- \nCAROLYN His hot sauce recipe won a contest last year. They sellin' it far away as San Antonio.

The MUSIC FADES-- \nOTIS Sheriff Charley had some real big friends in politics then, and if the truth come out it wasn't going to go easy on Hollis. (He shrugs) I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it--don't know why he trusted me. The first time I ever talked with him was right there, and then with a dead white man leakin' blood on the floor between us. He could charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy Deeds. \nWIDER \nThis isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face-- \nHOLLIS The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help. \nSAM And the ten thousand? \nHOLLIS Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late-- \nOTIS Time went on, people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been. \nSam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with-- \n", "test3_true": "Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering-- \nSAM Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have. \nHOLLIS Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it. \nSam gets up-- \nSAM Buddy's a goddamn legend.

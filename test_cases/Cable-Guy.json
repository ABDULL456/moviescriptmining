{"train": "The Cable Guy \nby Judd Apatow Based on a Screenplay by Lou Holtz Jr. \nShooting Script October 31, 1995 (White) Revised Pages November 13, 1995 (Blue) Revised Pages November 14, 1995 (Pink) \n1\tFULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE \nCredits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly image. \nThe camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television. \nThe camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote control. The hand changes channels frantically. \nThe camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception. Unfortunately for him \u0096 his cable is not hooked up. \nSTEVE (looks at watch) Jesus, where's the cable guy already? \nEND OF CREDIT SEQUENCE \n1A\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nIt is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just moved in. The phone rings. \nSTEVEN (into the phone) Hello. \n2\tNEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS \nWe see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television set. \nON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic on the screen says \"Sam Sweet Trial Update.\" \nRICK How's the move going? \n3\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nSteven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations. \nSTEVEN Horrible. The cable guy is missing in action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death. \nRICK You haven't called Robin have you? Please tell me you didn't call her. \nSTEVEN (sarcastically) No, I'm giving her space. (beat) I can't believe she's doing this. \nRICK You never should have asked her to marry you. You're the mad smotherer. \nSTEVEN All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger. \nRICK You forced her to evaluate the relationship. If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was. \nSTEVE I don't want to talk about it. So what time are you going to come by? \nRICK I can't. I'm working double shifts the rest of the week. \nSTEVEN It's my first night here. Don't do this to me. \nRICK The other camera guy pulled out his back. Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn't that enough? \nSTEVEN Fine, fine. \nRICK One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty ones. \nSTEVEN I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot. \nRICK None of them say no, believe me. I'll talk to you later. \nSteven hangs up, and waits. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n4\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nSteven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it back in the box. \n4A\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nEstablishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck pulls into a gated side garage. \n5\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER \n(End Revision - Pink) \n14\tINT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nSteven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks impressed. \nSteven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex. \nSTEVEN There are twenty-four classrooms; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home. The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform \"Oklahoma.\" \nEveryone laughs. Steven is very good at his job. \nSTEVEN The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing. \nThere is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up. \nMR. DANIELS Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling good? \nSTEVE Yeah. \nMR. DANIELS Did I hear something about you having some troubles at home? \nSTEVE Robin and I have been having a difficult time. I moved out, but I really think it's only temporary. \nMR. DANIELS Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a big mother. Know what I mean? If it fails, corporate's going to have my ass. I've got confidence in you, but you hear where I'm coming from, bro? \nSTEVEN Absolutely. Now I've got more time than ever. It's a good thing. (laughs) I know I can pull this thing off. \nMR. DANIELS (playfully) Then what are you doing talking to me? You've got a lot of work to do. Get to it! \nSTEVEN Thank you. I will. \nHal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, JOAN. \nSTEVEN I'll be right back. \n14A\tINT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY \nSteven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office. \n15\tOMITTED \n16\tINT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY \nROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at \"Sassy Magazine.\" Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written. \nSteven peeks his head in her door. \nSTEVEN Hello. \nRobin's face drops. \nROBIN Steven, what are you doing here? \nSTEVEN I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush article come out? \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nROBIN They liked it. (beat) I thought we agreed we weren't going to see each other for a month. \nSTEVEN I know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse. \nROBIN That's wonderful, congratulations. \nSTEVEN I know I'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate. \nROBIN I don't think we should. \nSTEVEN Come on, this is the biggest day of my career. \nROBIN Don't put me in this position. \nSTEVEN What position? I want to share this with you. \nROBIN (feeling pressured) I love you, but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean\u0085 this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me. \nSTEVE What? Now we're broken up? What happened to 'trial separation?' \nROBIN I can't get into this now. If you haven't noticed, I'm at work. \nCABLE GUY See, I knew the moment I met you that you would appreciate this. \nThe Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it. \nCABLE GUY (with wonder) The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities. (waves to Steven) Come on up! What are you waiting for?! \n22\tINT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT \nThe Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky. \nCABLE GUY Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me. \nSTEVEN I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted. \nCABLE GUY When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me. \nSTEVEN I know what you mean. My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town. \nCABLE GUY (moved) That's tough. You must have a lot of abandonment issues. Reality isn't \"Father Knows Best,\" it's a kick in the face on Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right? \nSTEVEN (tentative) You know my brother's a speech therapist. \nThe Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry. \nCABLE GUY So? \nThere is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react. \nSTEVEN Never mind. \nThe Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it. \nCABLE GUY (beat) So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh? \nSTEVEN I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out. \nCABLE GUY I hate that. \nSTEVEN She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that? \nCABLE GUY Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold. \nSTEVEN You're right. That is remarkably insightful. \nCABLE GUY Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final thought on Friday's show. \n23\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER \nThe van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building. \nCABLE GUY You know what? Women are suckers for \"Sleepless in Seattle.\" It's on HBO this month. That's your bait right there. \nSTEVEN Robin loves that movie. \nCABLE GUY They all do. Next time you talk to her tell her you're cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself. Sound like you're happier than a pig in shit. She'll come running. Betcha. Then just play it cool. \nSTEVEN Maybe I will. \nSteven gets out of the car. \nSTEVEN Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't know your name. What is it? \nCABLE GUY (touched) You really want to know my name? You do? Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my friends call me Chip. \nSTEVEN I'll see ya' Chip. \nBefore he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes. \nCABLE GUY Let's just remember right now. You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend. (long pause) I guess we're the lucky ones. \n(End Revised - Pink) \nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once. \nSTEVEN Uh\u0085 good-bye. \nCABLE GUY Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the flip side. \nSteven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable. \nJEFF I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play. \nCABLE GUY Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up. \nThe Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes. \nCABLE GUY Let's get it on! \nSTEVEN Are you any good? \nCABLE GUY Feed me under the boards and you'll find out. \nPlay begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands. \nCABLE GUY (doing the traveling hand signal) Traveling! That's traveling! \nRICK Yeah, whatever you say Chip. \nEveryone runs down the court, ignoring him. \nCABLE GUY All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it. \nSteven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court. \nCABLE GUY Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open! \nSteven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in. \nCABLE GUY (does the foul hand signal) And one! That's definitely a foul! (to Jeff) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants. \nSTEVEN (to Cable Guy) What are you doing? \nCABLE GUY Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys. \nMUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V. \na. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down. b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick. c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick. d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard. \nCABLE GUY Take it to the hole! \nSteven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in. \nCABLE GUY Hey, are you okay? \nHe pulls Steven up. \nSTEVEN Yeah. I'm fine. \nCABLE GUY Let's switch. I'll cover Rick. \nThe cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. \nSteven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball. \nRICK (enraged) What the hell was that? That's it. I've had enough. \nEveryone begins to exit the court. \nJEFF Thanks for bringing your \"friend\". \nThe Cable Guy runs up to Rick. \nCABLE GUY Good game. (slaps Rick on the butt) You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that. \nRICK (dismissive) Yeah. \nHe shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players. \nSTEVEN What are you doing? \nCABLE GUY It was payback time. I was protecting you. \n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) \nSTEVEN You ruined the game. \nCABLE GUY I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other. \nSTEVEN What are you talking about? I don't even know you! \nCABLE GUY Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total robo-babe. \nSTEVEN Are you serious? \nCABLE GUY Don't look. \nSTEVEN I've got to look. \nCABLE GUY Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like you are looking for the waitress. \nSteven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed. \nCABLE GUY Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind. But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief. \nSTEVEN (not laughing) You got me. \nCABLE GUY So what did you want to rap about? \nThe trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins. \nCABLE GUY Hold that thought. Show's on. \nThe Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena. \n32\tON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN \"ROBIN HOOD\" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD \nHOST Welcome to a magnificent journey into the past. This is Medieval Times! \nThe entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds. \nHOST Are you prepapred for a night of feasting and sport the likes of which ye will never forget?! \nThe audience applauds. \nHOST I charge you to stand up on your feet and cheer for your section's knight! \nON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated. \nCABLE GUY Let the games begin! The Red Knight rules! Blue Knight! You're going down! Going down! \nAn embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down. \n33\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER \nON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on horseback. \nON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show. \nSTEVEN (to the Watiress) Could I get a knife and fork? \nWAITRESS There were no utensils in Medieval Times, so there are no utensils at 'Medieval Times.' Do you want a refill on that Pepsi? \nSTEVEN There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi? \nWAITRESS Look, I have a lot of tables to get to. \nThe waitress exits. \nCABLE GUY (stands up - yells to the competitors) Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no mercy! \nThe two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins. \nThe crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy. \nCABLE GUY (to Steven) Come on, get into it, we won! \nReleuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds. \nSTEVEN (halfheartedly) Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing. Good work. \nSteven and the Cable Guy sit down. \nCABLE GUY So, what were you saying before? \nSTEVEN (tentatively) How do I put this? I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but... \nCABLE GUY That's why I became a cable guy. To make friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there was something there. I just knew it. \nSTEVEN (sotto) Oh lord. (tries to get back on track) I want you to know -- \nThen the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection. STEVEN (looking down) Jesus. \nThe Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick. \nThe show's host runs up to Steven. \nHOST Quickly, muster a top your steed. (Steven doesn't move - the host drops character) Get on the god damn horse! I don't think he's kidding! \nLeft with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy. STEVEN Don't do this! CABLE GUY Jim, we have no choice! STEVEN Oh my god. \nThey run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick. The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet. STEVEN (concerned) Are you okay? \nThe Cable Guy sits up and smile at him. CABLE GUY Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again. \nThe two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles. DISSOLVE TO LATER: 35\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT They are walking up the stairs. CABLE GUY You've got a real warrior's instinct. STEVEN I've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick. CABLE GUY If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back. I'm telling you these knights get laid all the time. STEVEN We should go again next week. CABLE GUY Easy there Lancelot. \nSteven opens the door to his apartment. 36\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine. MACHINE You have zero messages. CABLE GUY Nobody loves ya. (grabs a beer from the fridge) Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the living room the other day. Could you be a pal? \nSteven walks to the living room. 36AA\tINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Steven turns on the lights. CABLE GUY What do you think? \nSteven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line. STEVEN What is this? CABLE GUY I took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants. STEVEN You went in my house when I wasn't home? CABLE GUY How else was I supposed to get the stuff in here? Magic? STEVEN How much did this cost? CABLE GUY Practically nothing. I have a connection. Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up. STEVEN Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't feel right. CABLE GUY Yes but you give me something so much more valuable\u0085 friendship. STEVEN And you've given me friendship, so we're even. (beat) Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back. CABLE GUY (sadly) Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday? STEVEN (guilty) Sure, no problem. And don't get me wrong. I really appreciate the gesture. CABLE GUY Mm-hmm. (beat) Staple gun? STEVEN Oh, right. \nSteven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it. 36A\tINT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads \"HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.\" STEVEN (into the phone) Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work. Call me. \nHe hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not enter. MR. DANIELS How's it going? STEVEN Good. MR. DANIELS (long beat) Good good? STEVEN Great. MR. DANIELS Good. Keep it up. \nHe leaves. The phone rings. SECRETARY (through the intercom) Robin on line two. \nSteven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone. STEVEN Hey, I had the best time the other night. When am I going to get you on my couch again? \n36B\tINT. VAN - DAY The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone. CABLE GUY Well tonight's not looking too good. How about tomorrow? STEVEN Chip? CABLE GUY I knew I'd get you on the phone that way. Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow. It sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin. STEVEN What do you mean? CABLE GUY Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a few butts. Later gator. \n37\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING \"AMERICAN WOMAN.\" We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very uncomfortable. 37AA\tINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the fridge. STEVEN Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my message? \n37A\tINT. - ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT The scene intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way out. ROBIN Yes. You left me five messages. It king of freaked me out. STEVEN Sorry. I've been trying to reach you 'cause I'm having a party. You've got to come over. ROBIN (listens for a beat) I can't. I'm going to dinner with someone. STEVEN Dinner? What, like a date? ROBIN Not really a date. STEVEN You've got a date?! I thought things were going well between us. ROBIN They are. STEVEN So why are you going out on a date? ROBIN I made it before we got together the other night. I knew you would freak out. STEVEN I'm not freaking out. ROBIN Yes, you are freaking out. STEVEN I'm not. I just can't believe you would do this. ROBIN I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed to date. It's not like we're back together. We had a good time the other night, and you're already pressuring me. STEVEN (pissy) Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun. ROBIN I will. STEVEN Fine. Bye. \nSteven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer. CABLE GUY This is just a sign that you need to live a little. She's having fun, and you should too. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) STEVEN You're probably right. CABLE GUY Damn right I'm right. STEVEN Oh, I got you a little something. \nHe hands a box to the Cable Guy. CABLE GUY I thought you said we were even. You're breaking the rules. STEVEN So shoot me. \nHe opens it. The box says, \"Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days.\" The Cable Guy is so moved he cannot speak. STEVEN My brother said it might help with your lisp. \nThe Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard. CABLE GUY Words cannot express (he is too moved to finish his sentence) STEVEN It's no big deal. CABLE GUY Yes it is. \nHe stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable. CABLE GUY Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be the best party ever! Let's rock. \n37B\tINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing \"Superfreak.\" Everyone's having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd. (Revision Ends - Blue) STEVEN You've got plenty of friends. CABLE GUY These people are acquaintances. They're not ride to the airport friends, like us. (sees something) Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A real barn burner. Don't look. STEVEN You're playing with me again. CABLE GUY No sirree Steven. This woman is all over you like a lamp-shade. STEVEN Shut up. \nHe turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back. CABLE GUY Did it just get hotter in here? (grabs his crotch) Oh, that hurts. STEVEN Who'd she come with? CABLE GUY I don't know, but she looks pretty available to me. I'd strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates, masturbates, know what I'm saying? \nANGLE ON A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick. ODD MAN He sure can throw a party. Chip's an incredible man. I really admire him. RICK Where do you know him from? ODD MAN He hooked up my cable. Didn't charge me either. That's the kind of guy he is. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) ANGLE ON Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman. STEVEN Hey. I'm Steven. WOMAN Heather. STEVEN Can I get you something to drink? HEATHER Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila if you will. STEVEN Coming right up. \n37C\tINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AT THE KARAOKE AREA - Steven and Heather are singing \"You're the One that I Want\" from \"Grease.\" They are both drunk, and having a great time. The Cable Guy walks over to Rick. CABLE GUY I'm glad you accepted my invitation. RICK Steven invited me. \nThe Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather. CABLE GUY Look at him. Have you ever seen him so alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got to learn to live with that. RICK I don't know what your story is \"Chip Douglas,\" but I'm going to find out. CABLE GUY Oooh. How dramatic. \nThe song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him. RICK I'm getting out of here. STEVEN (drunk) Why? This is a great party. This girl is really into me. RICK You're whacked man. That guy is bad news. STEVEN You don't even know him. You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball. RICK I can't even deal. I'm outta here. \nON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone. \nCABLE GUY Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host. \nSteven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud. \nCABLE GUY Don't forget to kick in some spinach for the beer. Steven ain't made of money. And I expect some of you to join in the clean up crew. \nOFF DUTY COP Sing something! Do a song! \nCABLE GUY (false coyness) No\u0085 I really couldn't. \nODD MAN Come on! Do your song! \nCABLE GUY Okay, just to stop that guy from begging. This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house. \nHe puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song \"Bust A Move,\" accompanied by elaborate dance moves. \nHe sits in a chair, and leans over in pain. \nCABLE GUY She's clean I assure you. I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not a drip. She's the best, ask any of my friends. \nSteven cringes. \nSTEVE You've got to be kidding? Please tell me she's a friend of yours. You're just playing with my mind again, right? \nCABLE GUY I wish I had friends like that. \nSTEVEN Get out of my house! \nCABLE GUY Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie. \nSTEVEN Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. (to himself) Robin is never going to forgive me. \nCABLE GUY I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back. \nSTEVEN I don't want your help. I want you to leave. (gestures to the TV) And take that stuff out of here. \nCABLE GUY (calmly) Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see ya'. \nThe Cable Guy exits. \n42\tOMITTED \n43\tEXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nP.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant. \nWe move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A moment later he heads inside. \n44\tINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him. \nHOSTESS May I help you? \nCABLE GUY No, I'm meeting someone here. \nHe looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom. \n45\tINT. RESTROOM - NIGHT \nAn OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits. \nBATHROOM ATTENDANT Most appreciated. \nThe Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose. \nCABLE GUY You've been working hard. Take a break. \n46\tINT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER \nRobin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad plates in front of them. \nRAY My brother and I wanna start our own sun block company. But the twist is, it's only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki. We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki. Do you think that sounds good? \nROBIN BlockSki? That sounds right. \nRAY So, Gail told me you're just coming off a relationship. \nROBIN Well, not really. We're kind of in a holding pattern. He wants more of a commitment, but I don't think I'm ready. I just want to have a good time for a while. \nRAY Then we got to get you on a Skidoo! \nROBIN Skidoo? \nRAY High powered snow mobile. It'll blow your mind. It flies over powder like it's glass. \nTheir waitress passes by. \nRAY (impatiently) Hey, how are you doing on that chicken? Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks. \nRobin is mortified by his behavior. \nRAY So, how's your work going? \nROBIN It's been crazy. They just hired a \u0096 \nRay hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy G-Force. \nCABLE GUY from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the \"right stuff.\" \nThe Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket. \nCABLE GUY Don't worry about the tip. But I've got one for you. (whispers into his ear) Stay away from Robin. She's taken. \nHe tosses him out the door. \n47A\tINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nThe door opens, and Ray falls to the floor. \n47B\tINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nRobin sits alone at her table. She looks at her watch. In the background the Cable Guy slips out. \n48\tOMITTED \n49\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSteven is watching television while eating a TV dinner. \nON THE TV - LOCAL TELEVISION NEWS \nANCHOR MAN Here's a bizarre story from downtown, where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a bathroom attendant. The victim has been unable to speak since the unmotivated attack. \nWe see the image of a shaken up RAY being led out of the restaurant by two police officers. \nANCHOR MAN A police sketch artist put together this drawing from witnesses' descriptions. \nWe see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy. In it he has a moustache and appears to be Hispanic. Steven looks carefully. Does he know that man? Nah. He changes the channel. \nON THE TV - the FOX logo flies up, followed by a slick promo for a FOX Movie-of-the-Week on the Sam Sweet trial. \nANOUNCER (V.O.) Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the trial that's captured the nation. \nWe see ERIC ROBERTS holding a shotgun, pointed at another scared ERIC ROBERTS. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) The jury may still be out, but the chilling facts are in. Eric Roberts, in his dramatic debut is Sam and Stan Sweet. \"Brother, Sweet Brother: The Killing of Stanton Sweet.\" Tonight on Fox. \n49A\tEXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Cable Guy walks over to a FEMALE NEIGHBOR. \nCABLE GUY Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris? \nFEMALE NEIGHBOR (points) It's right upstairs. \n50\tINT. ROBIN'S HOME - NEXT DAY \nThere is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain. \nROBIN Who is it? \nThe Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible. \nCABLE GUY It's the Cable Guy. \nROBIN There's no problem with my cable. \nCABLE GUY I've got an upgrade order for one Robin Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every pay channel available. \nROBIN I didn't order this. \nCABLE GUY Apparently you've got a secret admirer. \nShe unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside. \nROBIN Was it a man named Steven? \nCABLE GUY I can't tell you. \nROBIN Come on. \nCABLE GUY No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say. \nHe gave it away on purpose. They both laugh. \nRight then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking concerned. \nPOLICE OFFICER Is there a Steven Bartowsky here? \nSTEVEN Uh\u0085 I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going on? \nPOLICE OFFICER You are under arrest. \nMR. DANIELS On what charge? \nPOLICE OFFICER Receipt of stolen merchandise. \nSTEVEN What? I never \u0096 \nPOLICE OFFICER Please put our hands on the table. \nSteven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain. \nPOLICE OFFICER Please follow my instructions. Hands on the table. \nSteven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of everyone. It is pure humiliation. \nPOLICE OFFICER Hands behind your back. \nThe other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around. \nPOLICE OFFICER #2 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand? \nSTEVE This is all a mistake. I didn't accept any stolen goods. \nJust then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head. \nCABLE GUY (V.O.) (with echo) you're getting THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants \u0096 cream in his pants. \nHe pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He tries to break the tension with a joke. \nSTEVEN Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to jail. \nNobody laughs. He exits. \n59\tEXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER \nSteven is walked to a police car, and put inside. \nWe slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose. \n60\tINT. POLICE STATION - LATER \nSteven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his LAWYER. \nEARL I can't believe you did this. \nSTEVEN I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present. \nEARL A stereo system and a big screen TV as a present? You expect me to believe that? You know you're killing your mother with this. \nSTEVEN I swear it's true. \nEARL Why would you accept such extravagant gifts? \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nSTEVEN I don't know. I shouldn't have. \nEARL What is really going on here Steven? Are you on something? \nSTEVEN I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please call my cable guy, his name is Ernie Douglas. \nLAWYER Steven, the police looked into it, nobody named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable Company.' \nEARL You want to tell us the truth now \nSTEVEN (falling apart) That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this is not happening. \nEARL Yes it is, and it's killing your mother. Did you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on Monday, Steven? \nSTEVEN Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan. (to the lawyer) When can you get me out of here? \nLAWYER Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail hearing today. You're going to have to spend the weekend in county lock up. \nCABLE GUY (as he buttons his shirt) I was just messing with your mind. That was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay. \nSTEVEN Guard! Guard! \nCABLE GUY Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make sure she's well taken care of. \nSTEVEN You go near her, I'll kill you. \nSteven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit. \nSTEVEN Hey, this is the guy who framed me! \nThe Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door. \nCABLE GUY (warmly) Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View. \nThey both laugh. The door closes behind them. \n65\tEXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u00c9 - DAY \nThe Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out loud to his lisp tape. \n(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue) \nCABLE GUY (over-pronouncing) Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon. Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious. Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational. \nRobin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her. \nROBIN Hello. \nCABLE GUY Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances. \nROBIN Me too. Believe me. \nCABLE GUY I know we don't know each other very well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven. \nROBIN Well, you were right. Something's happening with him and he won't even acknowledge it. \nCABLE GUY If he refuses to admit he has a problem, we may have to let him hit bottom. He's gonna need some tough love. \nROBIN (tentatively) You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company. \nCABLE GUY (chuckles) Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home. Kind of like a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate. \nROBIN And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you. \nCABLE GUY (I know, and I'm not mad. He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me. \nROBIN I just feel like I triggered this with him. It's not that I don't want to get married, it's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married. I don't deal well with pressure. \nCABLE GUY Hey, welcome to the human race. We're not perfect. We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a break. \nROBIN God I could go for turkey and mashed potatoes now. \nCABLE GUY Comfort food. Bring it on. \nROBIN Exactly. \nShe laughs. \nCABLE GUY You've got a great laugh. Can I make a small request? I'd like to hear it a little more often. \nShe blushes. \n66\tINT. PRISON ADMINISTRATION - NEXT DAY \nON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update. \nBARRY NOLAN The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing. In this \"Hard Copy\" exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party. The judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence. \nWe see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. \nSAM SWEET (to camera) Hey everyone. Look it's me and (gestures to his reflection) my brother Stan. (waves at reflection) Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How are you feeling? (to camera) Look, he's alive. \nSam punches the mirror, shattering it. \nSAM SWEET (angry) Now he's dead. \nRealizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile. \nSTEVEN Come here. \nHe pulls the Cable Guy aside. \nCABLE GUY Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm getting some really weird energy from you. \nSTEVEN Maybe it's because I just got out of prison, where you sent me. I should just drag you to the police right now. \nCABLE GUY You can if you like, but I'd hate to have to show Robin this. \nHe takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker. \nSTEVEN You son of a bitch. \nThe Cable Gut quickly puts it away. \nCABLE GUY Come on Steven, let's just have a good time tonight. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nRobin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over. \nEARL Steven, your mother and I had a long talk with your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER (to the Cable Guy) Thank you again for that. \nEARL (beat) We owe you an apology. I didn't realize the seriousness of your problems. You're obviously going through some kind of personal hell and I need to be more understanding. We didn't get involved with things like that when I was your age. \nSteven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them. \nEARL I know we haven't been there for you lately but we're going to see you through this, 'cause we are a family. I love you. \nHe gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER You've got a good friend here. \nThey walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails. \nSteven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch. \nPETE (winks) Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your chin up. \n71\tINT. DINING ROOM - LATER \nAs the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying dinner. \nCABLE GUY So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and he's chasing me, swinging like a mad man. I'm yelling at him, 'hey, it's just a show!' \n(Revision Ends - Blue) \nSTEVEN'S SISTER He always takes things too seriously. \nCABLE GUY Tell me something I don't know. This guy almost took my head off. \nEverybody laughs. \nThe camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage. \nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. \nThe Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION. \nON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion. \nON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION \nON STEVEN - getting very irritated. \nSTEVEN What are you doing? \nON THE CABLE GUY \nAs he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow motion. \nCABLE GUY It's from \"Goodfellas.\" Remember the intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two Times. \nHe moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs. \nTONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun. \nCABLE GUY (whispers) The password is\u0085 vagina. \nSteven winces. \nSTEVEN I really don't want to play this game. (looks to his mother) Woman. Woman. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER Uh\u0085 man? \nSTEVEN No. \nCABLE GUY (to Robin) Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis. \nRobin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out. \nCABLE GUY Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis. \nROBIN Vagina? \nCABLE GUY (pumps his fist) Yes! \nHe high fives Robin. Everyone laughs. \nEARL (blurts out) I thought it was going to be schlong! (covers his mouth - embarrassed) Whoops. \nEveryone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven. \nCABLE GUY The password is\u0085 nipple. \nSTEVEN Can I pass? \nEARL Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the mud. \nSTEVEN Breast. Breast. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER Tit? \nEveryone laughs. Steven's face is red. \nCABLE GUY Hard (gestures like there is another word after it) Hard \nROBIN Erection? \nEveryone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy. \nSTEVEN Center. Center. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER Nipple? \nEveryone cheers. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER I can't believe I got it. I was going to say areola. \nEveryone laughs except Steven, who is mortified. \nCABLE GUY I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead. \nThe Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear. \nCABLE GUY The password is\u0085 I'm not sure how to pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or clit-oris. \nSTEVEN (snaps) I can't say that to my mother! \nEARL Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle it. \nROBIN Come on Steven. We're just having fun. \nSTEVEN No, I've had enough. I can't do this. This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit here and play X-rated party games with him. \nEARL Steven, I really think you're over- reacting. \nSTEVEN I am not over-reacting. You're all being fooled by this guy! He's a felon for Christ sake! (to the Cable Guy) I hate you! Get out of my life! \nCABLE GUY I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance, I will leave. I would never stay where I am not wanted. \nROBIN (to the Cable Guy) You're not a nuisance. Please don't go. (to Steven) Steven, you're being an asshole. \nEARL Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one with the problem. \nSTEVEN What? You have no idea what this guy is really like. \nRICK You bet your ass you've been blowing me off. \nSTEVEN It's just, this guy is really doing a number on me. \nRICK I told you not to hang out with him. \nSTEVEN You're the one who told me to offer him money so I could get free cable. \nRICK You didn't tell me he was a psychopath. (beat) I'll see if I can get my friend in research to track him down. What's his name again? \nSTEVEN Ernie Douglas. \nRICK Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does that sound so familiar? \n81\tINT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY \nSteven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television. \nOn the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman. \nJoan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN DERSHOWITZ regarding \"the abuse excuse.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nSteven walks over to Joan. \nSTEVEN (to his secretary) Did anyone notice I'm late? \nJOAN What are you talking about, you've been here for an hour. \nSTEVEN Thank you. \nSteven walks to his office. \n81A\tINT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSteven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He clicks a button and a message comes on the screen. \nON THE SCREEN - \"GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE.\" \nThen an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before they watched \"Sleepless in Seattle.\" \nSTEVEN Work's good. \nROBIN How's Hal? \nSTEVEN Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless. \nROBIN It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up. \nSTEVEN I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done. \nThe sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this. \n81B\tOFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS \nSteven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down. \nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office. \nBACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can. \n81C\tINT. HAL'S OFFICE \nSteven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and sees Steven. \nHAL Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I have no vision. \nSteven knows what's coming. \n82\tOMITTED \n82A\tOMITTED \n82B\tOMITTED \n82C\tINT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER \nSteven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear. \nRICK (VO) He was fired for beating up a customer who yelled at him for being late. A company in Denver thinks they might have a lead on who he really is. If I were you I'd lock down tonight. I'll call you when I get some more info. \n98\tINT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSteven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake. \nON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking. \nPROSECUTOR (ON TV) Don't let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and said he was killed by an Asian gang. There was no laugh-track on that night. \nThe prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep. \n99\tON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP\tHE SLOWLY WAKES UP. \nThe gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar. \nON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We reveal that it is the Cable Guy. \nCABLE GUY This man killed his own brother. Some people don't even have a brother... \nThe camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera. \nCABLE GUY ...do they Steven? Are you listening to me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it -- \nON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room. \n100\tINT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the living room and sees Rick. \nRICK Why do you keep icing me man? \n100A\tINT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHe opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the door. \n100B\tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nHe continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he sees Robin's bedroom. \n100C\tINT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRobin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door. \n100D\tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nHe hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord. \nCABLE GUY You owe me! \nSteven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole. \n101\tP.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE \nThe Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the door. \n102\tINT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nSteven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him. \nSteven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks back another time and the Cable Guy is gone. \nHe keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides. \nCABLE GUY I just want to hang out. No big deal. \nSteven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room. \n103\tOMITTED \n104\tINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSteven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do. \nHe puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger. \nCABLE GUY Steven, you're just like me. We're cut from the same cloth. We're one and the same! \nThen it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television. \n109\tINT. RICK'S NEWSROOM - NIGHT \nRick sits at his desk. The PHONE RINGS. \nRICK Hello. \n109AA\tINT. MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT \nSuper Close Up - What the audience will think is Steven's mouth (actually the Cable Guy) speaking on a cellular phone. \nSTEVEN Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right away. I've got some information about this crazy cable guy. \nRICK Me too. I've got the whole story. \nSTEVEN That's great. Let's meet at the old school at nine-thirty. \nRICK Why all the way out there? \nSTEVEN I think he's been following me. Don't be late, buddy. \n109AB\tEXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSteven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE NEIGHBOOR opens her door. \nSTEVEN Be home! Be home! \nFEMALE NEIGHBOOR Go away! I remember you. You're her obsessive boyfriend. She said you might come here. I'm calling the police. \nShe closers her door. He runs off. \n109A\tEXT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - NIGHT \nRick drives up, then walks into the building. \n110\tINT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nRick walks through the school looking for Steven. \nRICK Steven? Steven? \nIn the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows. \nSTEVEN Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear what you found out about this nut. \nRICK I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply troubled. Only child. His mother was arrested for prostitution, and phone solicitation. Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer. \nSTEVEN No way. \nRICK And get this, he was discharged from the Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer. And that's not the half of it. \nAs Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp). \nCABLE GUY Really? Tell me more. \nRick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away. \nCABLE GUY I'm very interested in learning everything I can about that wacked out cable installer. \nHe turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy. \nThe camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not see Rick yelp, and fall. \nCABLE GUY It sounds like he might hurt somebody. \n110A\tINT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT \nSteven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up. \nSTEVEN (panicked) Hello. \nCABLE GUY (VO) (talks like a game show host) Nosey friends for two hundred. This supposed pal of Steven's is currently residing in the intensive care unit of Good Samaritan Hospital. \nSTEVEN Rick. \nCABLE GUY (VO) I'm sorry, you didn't answer in the form of a question. \nHe hangs up. \n111\tOMITTED \nThe Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish. \nCABLE GUY The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. \n117\tEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThe chase continues. \nSteven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way. \n117A\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT \nROBIN This is really fascinating, but I really think we ought to go now. \nCABLE GUY I knew you'd appreciate it. I took Steven here once, and he didn't give a rats ass about my interests. \nROBIN I'm worried about Steven. \nCABLE GUY Maybe Steven should be worried about you. (beat) So, where was I? \n118\tOMITTED (NOW PART OF SCENE 109AB) \n119\tOMITTED \n120\tOMITTED \n121\tOMITTED \n122\tEXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nSteven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs. \nThe horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat. \nCABLE GUY (chuckles) Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed it all last month. \nThe Cable Guy rides toward him again. \nCABLE GUY (like the Vegas announcer) Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!! \n(Revision Ends - Blue) \nThis time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face. \nSTEVEN Where's Robin?! \nCABLE GUY This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me. \nSteven charges directly at the Cable Guy. \nSTEVEN Where's Robin?!!! \nSteven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head. \nSTEVEN Tell me! \nCABLE GUY (nonchalantly) I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question? \nSteven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams into the ground. \nCABLE GUY Steven you've changed. (beat - then impressed) I like it. \nThe Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him. \nThey wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on. \nCABLE GUY I think it's time to make you cable ready. \nHe slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large branch and bats the Cable Guy off him. \nThe Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight. \nCABLE GUY Last time we fought I let you win! Best two out of three! \nMUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music. \nCABLE GUY (crazed) You treat me like the TV! You use me, but you can't live without me! \nThe Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch. \nHe does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed. \nSteven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and joins him. \nThe Cable Guy begins to lose his balance. \nCABLE GUY (knows he's about to fall) This is such an anti-climactic way to end this. \nThe Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his demise. \n125\tEXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER \nSteven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close. \nROBIN I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love you. \nSTEVEN I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you. \nROBIN We'll work them out together. \nThey kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water. \nCABLE GUY (between coughs) What just happened? Where am I? (remembers) Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you. \nHe leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays him on the ground. \nCABLE GUY (to Robin) It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going. \nHe holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish. \nSteven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them. \n126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT \nThe Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance. \nThe Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the platform. \nSTEVEN Easy. \nHe walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them. \nCABLE GUY It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people. \nSTEVEN Don't do anything stupid. \nCABLE GUY You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" -- \nSTEVEN (snaps) No! This is not like anything! This is not a movie! We're real people! You're hurting us! This is reality! \nThe Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of Robin. She runs to Steven's arms. \nFrom below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy. \nCABLE GUY If this is reality... (he climbs onto the guard railing) ...I am outta here. \nThe Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna. \nSTEVEN Nooo! \nSteven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other hand. \nSTEVEN You're not going anywhere. \nThe Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved. \nSTEVEN Don't do this. You just need help. We all get lonely. \nCABLE GUY Yeah, but I get really lonely. (beat) I mean, look at me. \nSTEVEN You're gonna be fine. Just come on up. \nCABLE GUY (a long beat) Steven, I think I sat too close to the television. Mommy was right. \nSteven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second. \nCABLE GUY It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby- sitter. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \n", "test1_input": "STEVEN Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUY \n(turns to leave) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all \u0096 jerk off! (turns back smiling) I'm just joking. Let's do this. (looks around) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here. \nSTEVEN What happened? \nCABLE GUY (long beat) They had a lot of cats. \nThey walk into Steven's living room. \nCABLE GUY Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card. \nHe pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him. \nCABLE GUY Please mail it in when I am done. \nSTEVEN These go to your boss? \nCABLE GUY No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss\u0085 perfectioniss (he strains to lose his lisp) perfectioniss\u0085t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with. \nThe Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space. \nCABLE GUY Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby. \nHe zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner. \nCABLE GUY Here's your sweet spot. \nHe pulls out his drill, and begins drilling. \nCABLE GUY So your lady kicked you out. \nSTEVEN What? \nCABLE GUY In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me. \nSTEVEN I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed. \nCABLE GUY No sweat. \nSteven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him. \nCABLE GUY Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you. \nSTEVEN Okay, whatever. \nSteven walks toward his bedroom. \nCABLE GUY Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time. \nThe Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke. \n13\tINT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nCLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION \nRIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio. \nRIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom \"Double Trouble\" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four. \nA video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of \"Double Trouble.\" Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. \nWe see a brief clip from \"Double Trouble,\" starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs. \nRIKKI KLIEMAN (to camera) Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called \"The Brotherhood of Friends.\" Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of \"Twin Envy.\" \nANGLE ON \nSteven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television. \nSTEVEN How's it going? \nThe Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say \"quiet.\" His eyes never leave the TV. \nCABLE GUY Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard. \nSteven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible. \nSTEVEN (looks around) What happened? \n", "test1_true": "STEVEN (non-confrontational) I\u0085 guess so. \nCABLE GUY You programmed? (off of Steven's look) Then let me slave your remotes. \nHe picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him. \nCABLE GUY Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone. \nSTEVEN So after this I'll only need one remote for everything? \nCABLE GUY You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself. (he finishes) Now let me check your levels. \nWith amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless. \nCABLE GUY All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here. \nSteven does. \nCABLE GUY That gave me power of attorney over you. (beat) Joking. \nSteven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave. \nCABLE GUY I'm about finished here. (beat) Okay. I feel good about this. \nCable Guy walks to the door. \nSTEVEN One thing. \nCABLE GUY (turns back immediately) Yeah! \nSTEVEN I\u0085 uh\u0085 I have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you ever heard of anything like that? \nCABLE GUY (deadly serious) You mean illegal cable? \nSTEVEN Uh\u0085 yes. \nCABLE GUY Who told you that? I want his name. \nSTEVEN Forget it. \nCABLE GUY You're offering me a bribe? What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility. \nSTEVEN Please\u0085 that was dumb. I was just making conversation \u0096 \nCABLE GUY (laughs) I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All it is is a push of a button. \nHe puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door. \nSTEVEN Oh, great. How much? \nCABLE GUY Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid. \nSTEVEN That is so nice. \nCABLE GUY Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or something. (hands him a card) Here is my personal beeper number. It's just for my preferred customers. Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold. \nSTEVEN Thanks. Really. (holds up comment card - jokes) You're gonna get some good marks here. \nCABLE GUY Maybe some day I'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It's really incredible. \nSTEVEN Sure. We should do that one day. \nCABLE GUY How 'bout tomorrow? \nSTEVEN Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good. \nCABLE GUY What are you going to do, sit home and stew about your ex? \nSTEVEN No. \nCABLE GUY (insulted) Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line. Sorry. \nSTEVEN (guilty) You didn't cross the line. \nCABLE GUY No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty. On the flip side. \nThe Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into that. \n", "test2_input": "STEVEN Well, it's nice just to see you. (looks at his watch) Hey, it should be starting. \nThey sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume. \nSTEVEN Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch. \nROBIN It's alright. We can watch it another night. \nSTEVEN No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time. \nHe plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't. \nSTEVEN Wait, wait. I know what to do. \nHe walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials it, then presses the number in. \nSTEVEN The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time. \n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) \nSteven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing \u0096 \nTHERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR \nSteven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled. \nSTEVEN That was\u0085 fast. \nCABLE GUY Is there a problem with your service? \nSTEVEN Yeah\u0085 my cable went out. \nSteven pushes him out into the hall. \nCABLE GUY Really? \nThe Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord. \nCABLE GUY So you called me. Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people? \nSTEVEN I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important. \nHe peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back out. \nCABLE GUY But calling me back isn't? \nSTEVEN I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me. \nCABLE GUY Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me? \nSTEVEN Anything you want. Name it \u0096 quickly. \nCABLE GUY Tomorrow night, we hang out. \nSTEVEN Fine, whatever you want. \nCABLE GUY God bless you. You're too good to me. \nThe Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven. \nCABLE GUY (loud-normally) All set. \nSTEVEN So what's with the cut cord? \nCABLE GUY (nonchalantly) That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow Steven. (conspiratorially) She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't even touch her. Fight the urge at all costs. It will pay off later with \nHe makes a motion which implies sex. \nCABLE GUY Enjoy the flick. \nThe Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside. \nROBIN Who was that? \nSTEVEN Nobody. \nSteven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy. \n28\tON THE TV \n", "test2_true": "The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van \u0096 alone. We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we can tell that he lives there. \n29\t(SCENE 29 OMITTED) \n30\tEXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK \nThe Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed. \nCABLE GUY Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of a weird mood. How'd things go with you? Keep 'em closed. \nSTEVEN Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the other night. I didn't appreciate you -- \nCABLE GUY Don't peek. I want this to be a surprise. \nSTEVEN I really don't need to be surprised. Where are we going? \nCABLE GUY Only the best restaurant in town. \nThey walk around a corner. \nCABLE GUY Okay, here we are. Open sesame. \nSteven opens his eyes. \nThe camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says \"MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT.\" \nSTEVEN Medieval Times? \nCABLE GUY I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I'm buying. \n31\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER \nThe Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc. \n(Revision Ends - Pink) \nSTEVEN Funny. I never thought I would ever come here. \nCABLE GUY I love this place. I come here twice a week. \nA Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed. \nCABLE GUY Oh man, that's my look. I love big butts. Ow, that hurts. \nHe grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself. \nCABLE GUY There oughta be a law. Man she is hot. It's just not fair. \nSTEVEN (gestures to him squeezing his crotch) Please don't. \nCABLE GUY You know what I need right now? Pooooon tang. And I'm not talking about the place in Vietnam. \nSTEVEN Good to know. \nThey sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not enthusiastic about her job. \nWAITRESS (flatly) Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is Melinda. I'll be your serving wench. May I get you something from the bar keep? \nCABLE GUY (too into it) Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust. \nWAITRESS (uninspired) I'll be right back my lord. \nThe Cable Guy puts something together. \nCABLE GUY There you go. \nHe hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on. \nSTEVEN Thanks for the help. \nThe Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen. \nCABLE GUY Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week. \nSteven acts like he isn't interested, but he is. \nSTEVEN Really? What does she look like? \n", "test3_input": "ROBIN Yes, your friend came by. \nSTEVEN My friend? \nROBIN The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind of goofy, but nice. Thank you so much for doing that. \nSTEVEN I'm\u0085 glad you liked it. I've wanted to do something nice for you, but I've been trying to give you your space. \nROBIN Well, I don't think we should make rules anymore. \nSTEVE Okay. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nROBIN Call me later if you're around? \nSTEVEN Sure. I'll call you as son as I get home. Bye. \nSteven is elated. He can barely contain himself. \nRICK (O.S.) Steven, are you ready to go? \nSteven turns and sees Rick wearing a \"Soundgarden\" T-shirt. \nSTEVEN (pained) The concert. Oh Jesus. \nRICK What? \nSTEVEN Robin just called. I think we're getting back together. \nRICK (pissed) So you're blowing me off? I can't believe this. \nSTEVEN This is the first time she asked to get back together. \nRICK You do this every time. You only call me after a girl breaks your heart. \"Oh Rick can I stay on your couch? Let's talk all night about how mean girls are.\" Then as soon as a relationship starts again it's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I fall for it anymore. \n55\tOMITTED \n56\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off. \nSTEVEN Can't you get someone else to go? \n(Revision Ends - Blue) \nRICK Maybe I'll take MY cable guy. \nSteven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable Guy appears from behind a corner. \nCABLE GUY Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you knock 'em down. \nSTEVEN What? \nCABLE GUY Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced her up. \nSTEVEN How do you know we're back together? \nCABLE GUY Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac. \nSTEVEN I don't want you messing around with my life. You've caused enough trouble as it is. \nCABLE GUY I know. I felt bad about the other night, so I wanted to make it up to you. So what are you doing? Do you want to catch a bite? \nSteve looks the Cable Guy in the eye. \nSTEVEN (sincerely yet curt) Look, I appreciate you helping me out with Robin. But you have to understand, I'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again. You're a great guy, but I just don't have any room in my life for a new friend. Do you understand? \nCABLE GUY I appreciate your honesty. You're a real straight shooter. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nSTEVEN So, you're okay? \nCABLE GUY Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal. Whatever. \nSTEVEN All right\u0085 well, take care. \nCABLE GUY Have a good one. \n", "test3_true": "57\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nON THE TV - Conan O'Brien is doing a monologue joke about Sam Sweet. \nSteven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In the middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? Steven looks scared. \nROBIN Are you alright? \nSTEVEN I'm fine. \nThey go back to kissing. \n57A\tEXT. TELEPHONE POLE/INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a phone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the telephone pole. \nCABLE GUY Hey, it's Chip Douglas. \nROBIN Chip Douglas? \nCABLE GUY Your cable guy. \n(Revision Ends - Blue) \nROBIN (surprised to hear from him) Oh, hi. What's up? \nCABLE GUY I feel kind of weird calling you. It's just\u0085 I'm worried about Steven. \nROBIN What is it? \nCABLE GUY Something isn't right. He hasn't been himself lately. Have you noticed anything? \nROBIN No, things are actually going really well. \nCABLE GUY Good. \nROBIN Should I be worried? \nCABLE GUY Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open. \nROBIN (nervous) I will. Good-bye. \nShe hangs up, then dials Steven's number. \nROBIN Steven Bartowsky please. \n57B\tINT. STEVEN'S SECRETARY'S DESK - CONTINUOUS \nHis secretary, JOAN, answers the phone. \nJOAN Sorry Robin. He's in a meeting. \n58\tINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nA dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven listens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group. \nSALES MANAGER The response to our initial offering has been remarkable. A local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals. In retrospect I must admit we made one big mistake. \nEveryone hangs on his every word. \nSALES MANAGER We should have asked for more money. \nThe entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up. \nMR. DANIELS I just want to put this out there, Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your cajones, and mine, out on the table, and you slam dunked it. Way to go. (nervously jokes) Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs ahead of me. All right, in other business \nAs Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door. \nJOAN (quietly) Pssst. Steven. \nSteven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off. \nJOAN (more urgently-quietly) I really need to speak with you. \nSome people are beginning to notice this exchange. \nSTEVEN (curtly) It can wait. \n"}

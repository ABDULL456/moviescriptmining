Steven turns on the television. The screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume. \nSTEVEN Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch. \nROBIN It's alright. We can watch it another night. \nSTEVEN No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time. \nHe plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't. \nSTEVEN Wait, wait. I know what to do. \nHe walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials it, then presses the number in. \nSTEVEN The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time. \n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) \nSteven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone.

Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people? \nSTEVEN I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important. \nHe peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back out. \nCABLE GUY But calling me back isn't? \nSTEVEN I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me. \nCABLE GUY Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me? \nSTEVEN Anything you want. Name it \u0096 quickly. \nCABLE GUY Tomorrow night, we hang out. \nSTEVEN Fine, whatever you want. \nCABLE GUY God bless you. You're too good to me. \nThe Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven. \nCABLE GUY (loud-normally) All set. \nSTEVEN So what's with the cut cord? \nCABLE GUY (nonchalantly) That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow Steven. (conspiratorially) She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't even touch her. Fight the urge at all costs.

PARKING LOT - DUSK \nThe Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed. \nCABLE GUY Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of a weird mood. How'd things go with you? Keep 'em closed. \nSTEVEN Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the other night. I didn't appreciate you -- \nCABLE GUY Don't peek. I want this to be a surprise. \nSTEVEN I really don't need to be surprised. Where are we going? \nCABLE GUY Only the best restaurant in town. \nThey walk around a corner. \nCABLE GUY Okay, here we are. Open sesame. \nSteven opens his eyes. \nThe camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says \"MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT.\" \nSTEVEN Medieval Times? \nCABLE GUY I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I'm buying. \n31\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER \nThe Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc. \n(Revision Ends - Pink) \nSTEVEN Funny. I never thought I would ever come here. \nCABLE GUY I love this place. I come here twice a week. \nA Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed. \nCABLE GUY Oh man, that's my look. I love big butts. Ow, that hurts. \nHe grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself. \nCABLE GUY There oughta be a law. Man she is hot. It's just not fair. \nSTEVEN (gestures to him squeezing his crotch) Please don't. \nCABLE GUY You know what I need right now? Pooooon tang. And I'm not talking about the place in Vietnam. \nSTEVEN Good to know. \nThey sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not enthusiastic about her job. \nWAITRESS (flatly) Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is Melinda. I'll be your serving wench. May I get you something from the bar keep? \nCABLE GUY (too into it) Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust. \nWAITRESS (uninspired) I'll be right back my lord. \nThe Cable Guy puts something together. \nCABLE GUY There you go. \nHe hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on. \nSTEVEN Thanks for the help. \nThe Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen. \nCABLE GUY Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week. \nSteven acts like he isn't interested, but he is. \nSTEVEN Really? What does she look like? \n", "test1_id": 2022, "test2_input": "STEVEN Come here. \nHe pulls the Cable Guy aside. \nCABLE GUY Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm getting some really weird energy from you. \nSTEVEN Maybe it's because I just got out of prison, where you sent me. I should just drag you to the police right now. \nCABLE GUY You can if you like, but I'd hate to have to show Robin this. \nHe takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker. \nSTEVEN You son of a bitch. \nThe Cable Gut quickly puts it away. \nCABLE GUY Come on Steven, let's just have a good time tonight. \n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) \nRobin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over. \nEARL Steven, your mother and I had a long talk with your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER (to the Cable Guy) Thank you again for that. \nEARL (beat) We owe you an apology. I didn't realize the seriousness of your problems. You're obviously going through some kind of personal hell and I need to be more understanding. We didn't get involved with things like that when I was your age. \nSteven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them. \nEARL I know we haven't been there for you lately but we're going to see you through this, 'cause we are a family. I love you. \nHe gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER You've got a good friend here. \nThey walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails. \nSteven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch. \nPETE (winks) Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your chin up. \n71\tINT. DINING ROOM - LATER \nAs the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying dinner. \nCABLE GUY So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and he's chasing me, swinging like a mad man. I'm yelling at him, 'hey, it's just a show!' \n(Revision Ends - Blue) \nSTEVEN'S SISTER He always takes things too seriously. \nCABLE GUY Tell me something I don't know. This guy almost took my head off. \nEverybody laughs. \nThe camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage. \nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. \nThe Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION. \nON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion. \nON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION \nON STEVEN - getting very irritated. \nSTEVEN What are you doing? \nON THE CABLE GUY \nAs he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow motion. \nCABLE GUY It's from \"Goodfellas.\" Remember the intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two Times. \nHe moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs. \nTONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun. \n", "test2_true": "Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all the way. \nCABLE GUY You'll never catch me copper. \nThe Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends it's a moustache. \nCABLE GUY I'm gonna wear a disguise. \nSteven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something. \nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face. Steven realizes that they are the same person. \nSteven gets a frightened look on his face. \nThe kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells \"pow.\" The Cable Guy drops to the floor like he's been shot. \nCABLE GUY Oh, you got me. \nThe Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges to grab him. \nCABLE GUY (devil voice) Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives! \nThe kid screams with laughter and runs away. The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out of the room. Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety. He follows them. \n72-75\tOMITTED \n75A\tINT. LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER \nSteven walks around looking for Tony. Suddenly from behind a couch Tony and the Cable Guy pop out. \nTONY/CABLE GUY Booo! \nSteven flies back, scared out of his wits. Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically. They have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank. \nCABLE GUY Oh man, you should have seen your face. It was classic. \nSTEVEN Very funny. Tony, go to your mother! \nTony immediately starts crying. He leaves. \nCABLE GUY Look what you've done. \nSTEVEN I know you beat up Robin's date. \nThe Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime. \nCABLE GUY I guess I did what you didn't have the guts to do. \nSTEVEN You stay away from Robin. \nCABLE GUY (disturbed) Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a part of the family, and I like it. You should try it sometime. \nSteven's mother enters. \nSTEVEN'S MOTHER (looks at them) My, you two look like brothers. Come on back, we're all having coffee in the living room. \nCable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room. \nCABLE GUY (happily) Are you guys trying to fatten me up? 'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn good job of it. \nHe laughs, and exits. Steven slowly follows. \n76-78 OMITTED \n79\tINT. LIVING AREA - LATER \nEveryone is sitting around having coffee. The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of paper. \nCABLE GUY You guys have never played \"Porno Password?\" \nEARL No, but I like the sound of it. \nCABLE GUY It's the adult version of the popular television game show. Robin you're on my team. Steven, you're with mom. (to everyone else) You're the audience. \nThe Cable Guy sits next to Robin. Steven and his mother sit across from them. \nThe Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it. He whispers it in Steven's ear. \n", "test2_id": 2023, "test3_input": "He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed. \nSteven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and joins him. \nThe Cable Guy begins to lose his balance. \nCABLE GUY (knows he's about to fall) This is such an anti-climactic way to end this. \nThe Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his demise. \n125\tEXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER \nSteven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close. \nROBIN I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love you. \nSTEVEN I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you. \nROBIN We'll work them out together. \nThey kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water. \nCABLE GUY (between coughs) What just happened? Where am I? (remembers) Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you. \nHe leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays him on the ground. \nCABLE GUY (to Robin) It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going. \nHe holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish. \nSteven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them. \n126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT \nThe Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance. \nThe Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the platform. \nSTEVEN Easy. \nHe walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them. \nCABLE GUY It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people. \nSTEVEN Don't do anything stupid. \nCABLE GUY You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" -- \nSTEVEN (snaps) No! This is not like anything! This is not a movie! We're real people! You're hurting us! This is reality! \nThe Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of Robin. She runs to Steven's arms. \nFrom below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy. \nCABLE GUY If this is reality... (he climbs onto the guard railing) ...I am outta here. \nThe Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna. \nSTEVEN Nooo! \nSteven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other hand. \nSTEVEN You're not going anywhere. \nThe Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved. \nSTEVEN Don't do this. You just need help. We all get lonely. \nCABLE GUY Yeah, but I get really lonely. (beat) I mean, look at me. \nSTEVEN You're gonna be fine. Just come on up. \nCABLE GUY (a long beat) Steven, I think I sat too close to the television. Mommy was right. \nSteven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second. \nCABLE GUY It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance.

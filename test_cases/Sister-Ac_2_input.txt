Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim expression. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM 
Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with Willy standing guard over her. 
Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in. She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity. 
VINCE (turning on the charm) Babe. 
Christy does not reply. 
VINCE Babe, what happened here?  Look at you. 
CHRISTY Good evening, Vincent. 
VINCE What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you? 
CHRISTY I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours. 
Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed. 
WILLY She's a nun, Vince. 
VINCE (kneeling by Christy) I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love? 
CHRISTY You will be judged, Vincent.  We all will. 
Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting angry. 
VINCE What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get judged, baby. (MORE)

VINCE (CONT'D) And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind. 
WILLY She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up. 
JOEY It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing. 
Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat. 
VINCE She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid. 
CHRISTY (calmly) I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you. 
This really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey and Willy. 
VINCE Who gives a damn?  Waste her. 
Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of the room. 
INT. PLANE 
The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its colorful flashes of neon. 
MARY PATRICK It's so beautiful... 
MARY ROBERT And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas... 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And Gommorah. 
The plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior and the nuns climb out. 
INT. BAR AREA 
Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar.

VINCE It's done? 
JOEY Not... totally. 
VINCE (disturbed) What's the problem? 
WILLY She's... she's a nun. 
VINCE Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe! 
JOEY But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent? 
VINCE It didn't happen. 
WILLY She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car. 
JOEY No smart-ass remarks or nothing. 
VINCE I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time. 
JOEY Yeah... 
WILLY Right.  That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first.  It could always be the other guy. 
They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy leave.

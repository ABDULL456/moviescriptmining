LESTER One year's salary, with benefits. 
BRAD That's not going to happen. 
LESTER Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot? 
Brad LAUGHS. 
BRAD Against who? 
LESTER Against you. 
Brad stops laughing. 
LESTER (CONT'D) Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me? 
Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester. 
BRAD Man. You are one twisted fuck. 
LESTER (standing) Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose. 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 
Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years. 
LESTER Yeah! 
INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY 
Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious. 
BUDDY Carolyn. 
CAROLYN Buddy. 
Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name. 
BUDDY I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left for New York this morning, and... let's just say things were very hectic around the house. 
CAROLYN What's she doing in New York? 
BUDDY She's moving there. (off Carolyn's look) Yes. We are splitting up. 
CAROLYN Buddy. I'm so sorry. 
BUDDY (bitterly) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow. (then, laughing) Ah, it's for the best. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAROLYN When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. 
BUDDY Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times. 
He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY 
Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the ground at his feet. 
On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing. 
ANGELA (O.C.) What are you doing? 
On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us. 
RICKY (O.C.) I was filming this dead bird. 
ANGELA Why? 
RICKY (O.C.) Because it's beautiful. 
On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh. 
ANGELA I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy. 
On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane. 
RICKY (O.C.) Hi, Jane.

He means Phillippe. 
D'ARTAGNAN Then who is that lying beside you? 
Porthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if he's totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and gagged beside him. 
PORTHOS Wh-- ?  Where did he come from? 
Athos grabs d'Artagnan's arm. 
ATHOS If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen. 
D'ARTAGNAN I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot. 
D'Artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind Louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking. Aramis suddenly backhands Louis, knocking him flat on his back in the boat, and pointing to him -- Louis. 
ARAMIS This man is an impostor.  We caught him trying to impersonate the King, and were just getting rid of him. 
Louis struggles upright. 
LOUIS D'Artagnan, arrest them all! 
ARAMIS Shut up, knave! 
Aramis slaps Louis again, and pleads with his eyes that d'Artagnan accept their ruse.  D'Artagnan is dying inside. 
D'ARTAGNAN Before I came here, I insisted the King come with me.  The real Louis would never have let me insist. 
Seeing they are about to be arrested, the old Musketeers in the boat spring into action against their younger counterparts.  Athos swats one swordsman with an oar; Porthos seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and flings the man back into two of his comrades; Aramis grabs Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat. 
ARAMIS Pull them back, d'Artagnan. 
D'ARTAGNAN You can't do it. 
ARAMIS Pull them back! 
D'ARTAGNAN Everyone back. 
ARAMIS Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now! 
Phillippe obeys. 
ARAMIS Open the gate. 
D'Artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate leading out to the river. 
The boat makes for the opening.  Just as it is about to reach it, Louis forces Aramis' hand. 
LOUIS You will not shed royal blood! 
He kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around.  Aramis draws the dagger away from Louis' throat to keep from killing him, and d'Artagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto the stone floor of the channel. 
The boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches at his brother, Phillippe. 
The current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the Musketeers can't stop it.  Athos seizes Phillippe's legs and tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great, and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are helping hold Phillippe. 
Phillippe's legs slip out of Athos' grasp, and the boat flashes downriver... 
Aramis, Porthos and Athos have escaped... but Phillippe is captured, looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin brother Louis. 
INT.  SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 
Louis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at d'Artagnan, just behind him; the young Musketeers with Phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back. 
LOUIS I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one! 
D'ARTAGNAN It shall be done, your Majesty. 
LOUIS Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain! 
D'ARTAGNAN Yes, your Majesty. 
They reach a doorway, and the King bangs through it, into his own bedchamber, still spouting anger. 
LOUIS I was told this impostor was dead! 
D'ARTAGNAN ... You knew you had a double? 
LOUIS He is my brother. 
D'Artagnan is frozen in surprise.  Phillippe and his guards move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing Louis' own clothes, fans Louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins ripping the royal garments off Phillippe. 
D'Artagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe.

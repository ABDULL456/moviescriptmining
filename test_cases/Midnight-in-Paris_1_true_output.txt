SCOTT (stops at another table) Greetings and salutations. You'll forgive me - I've been mixing grain and grappa ··· This is Gil - Gil? Yes, Gil. GIL Gil Pender. HEMINGWAY Hemingway. GIL Hemingway?     Hey, is this some kind of a - HEMINGWAY You liked my book? GIL Liked - I loved - everything you wrote - HEMINGWAY Yes it was a good book because it was an honest book and that's what war does to men and there's nothing fine and noble about dying in the mud unless you die gracefully and then it's not only noble but brave. GIL Ernest Hemingway - this is - I - HEMINGWAY (introduces his drinking partner) Say hello to Pender - the bulls in the ring don't frighten Belmonte - he's killed many brave ones. Fine brave bulls. GIL I'm sure - good bulls, true bulls ··· HEMINGWAY Why are you smiling? CONTD: (2) 
SCOTT (drinks) In New York you can't buy this - it can only be made in a bathtub - and some of the bathtub mixtures are damn good - (to Zelda) Isn't that so? She prefers her hootch from a homemade still - more kick. ZELDA (to Hemingway) Did you read my story?   What did you think? HEMINGWAY It began well - really well - then it became weak. ZELDA I might've known you'd hate it. SCOTT Darling you're too sensitive. ZELDA You liked the story but he hates me. HEMINGWAY There was some fine writing but it was not fulfilled. SCOTT Please old sport - you make matters extremely difficult. ZELDA I'm jumpy - suddenly I don't like the atmosphere here anymore. (to Belmonte) Where are you going?

SAUL (pointing across the room) There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something. 
DALE Were they armed? 
SAUL (whispering) I don't think so. 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Dale and Saul both scramble along a row of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. They continue running and then stop. 
DALE I can't hear them. 
Saul spots an air vent in the middle of the room. 
SAUL You could boost me up! We'll sneak out. 
BLAM! BLAM! They are being shot at again. 
DALE Shoot back! 
SAUL Really? 
DALE YES! 
Saul hesitantly takes aim and pulls the trigger. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
DALE (CONT'D) Now run! 
They run and turn several corners when Saul suddenly trips over a dead thug. 
SAUL                             DALE AH!!!                         WHOA!!! 
DALE (CONT'D) Nice. You got him. 
Dale picks up the thug's machine gun. Suddenly, a thug appears behind Saul. 
THUG 7 Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of- 
Dale shoots right over Saul's shoulder and nails the thug several times. 
DALE Holy shit. I killed him. 
SAUL About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already. 
Saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a deep breath. 
DALE You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man. 
SAUL What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you? 
Dale cocks his gun. 
DALE Don't worry about me. 
SAUL Whoa. That was awesome. 
Saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off. 
SAUL (CONT'D) You're a good man, Dale Denton. 
Saul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the room and immediately go for his gun. 
DALE Hold on! 
SAUL Wha- 
Dale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo. 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale vanishes into the foliage. 
TED Denton!!! 
INT. VENT - CONTINUOUS 
Saul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner and- 
SAUL AHHH!!! 
There is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls over the skeleton. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy. 
He spots dog tags around it's neck as he crawls by. They read: Private Greg B. Miller.

ON SELFRIDGE, considering this. CUT TO: 
INT. LINK ROOM 
SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and MAX prep the system. 
SELFRIDGE You've got one hour. Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down, you get them to evacuate. One hour. 
Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence. CUT TO: 
INT. COMMONS -DAY 
The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi -- 
JAKE (SUBTITLED) Eytukan, I have something to say, to everyone. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Speak, Jakesully. 
JAKE (SUBTITLED) A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon. 
A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd. 
JAKE (SUBTITLED) You have to leave, or you will die. 
MO'AT Are you certain of this? 
JAKE They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it. 
NEYTIRI What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen? 
He is unable to meet her eyes. 
JAKE Yes. (ANGUISHED) At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love-- with the forest, with the Omaticaya People -- (he looks at her) -- with you. And by then, how could I tell you? 
Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain -- 
NEYTIRI I trusted you, Jake! 
JAKE Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to -- 
NEYTIRI You will never be one of the People! NEVER! 
TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS -- 
TSUTEY (SUBTITLED) Bind them. 
They grab Jake, who doesn't resist. Others seize Grace. Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound. CUT TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY 
SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the GENERAL DYNAMICS C-21 DRAGON GUNSHIP. 
Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world below like Napoleon astride his horse. 
EXT. HOMETREE 
JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to Hometree. The People look up as -- 
THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees. The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of flying leaves and debris. 
IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen -- a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts. 
QUARITCH Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed. 
TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships. 
QUARITCH I think they mean to cut their throats if we don't back off. Make sure you get a nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto the after-action report. 
JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby -- 
JAKE You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, I'm begging you! 
EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU'TEY and yells -- 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Take the ikran! Attack from above! 
Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree. 
IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient. 
QUARITCH Alright, let's get this done. Give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door. 
GUNNER Roger.   CS forties. Going hot. 
QUARITCH Fire. 
On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and -- 
K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS. 
THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to cough and gag. 
Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the gunships with their longbows. 
IN THE DRAGON'S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK against the armored windows. 
AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse. 
EYTUKAN (yelling/subtitled) Everybody outside! Go to the Forest. 
The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling. Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas. 
JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings. 
KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons. FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree. 
INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside, coughing and dragging wounded with them. 
High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball. 
OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts. 
Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake.    She raises a KNIFE and -- 
SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with horror, but also something else. Call it faith.

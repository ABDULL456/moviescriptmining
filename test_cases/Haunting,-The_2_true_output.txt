The sound grows nearer.  Out in the hall.  Like something searching. Coming toward them. 
Nell lunges at the door.  Theo grabs to stop her, and Nell sees the door is DEADBOLTED.  There's a RUSHING sound on the other side of the tall door.  Right there.  Nell freezes.  BUMP!  BUMP! 
THEO (cont'd) Nell! 
Nell recoils to Theo's side, drags Theo out of bed to the corner of the room. 
Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP. 
Nell and Theo's eyes travel over the walls, following whatever it is which now seems to be moving out here in the theater. 
The SOUND moves along the wall to the right, reaching its loudest as it crosses the back of the theater, then seems to come down the left side. 
Theo shivers.  Nell clutches her close.  Nell writhes, unable to stand it any longer.  She jumps up. 
THEO (cont'd) Nell! 
Nell charges the door, screaming: 
NELL No! 
SILENCE.  The bumping goes dead.  Nell blinks, looks back at Theo. But Theo is looking at her hands. 
THEO (cont'd) Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it. 
She looks up in horror at Nell.  Their breath FOGS in the air.  Nell holds her hand up in front of her, and as we watch HER HAIR PRICKLES UP, GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM. 
Her eyes turn up to the door, and: BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM!  The DOOR JARS in its frame, leaping from the blows of whatever's on the other side. 
Nell backpedals but slips on the rug, falls there on the floor right in front of the door.  Theo SCREAMS. 
Silence.  The BANGING stops.  With a RUSH, whatever is outside the door is no longer there. 
Nell looks at Theo. 
Then Theo looks at the bathroom. 
Nell starts for it, grabs Theo's door, but it's designed to be locked from the BATHROOM SIDE.  Nell looks up -- 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
-- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.  Theo appears in the doorway behind her.  Across the bathroom the door to Nell's room is closed.  Nell dashes for it -- 
-- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead.  On the other side of the door.  Rasping over wood.  Like a thing without hands trying to turn -- 
-- THE DOORKNOB.  A long beat.  The metal creaks as something takes hold of it on the other side. 
Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.  It's open. She's in no-man's land: too far from the door to lock it, too close to run. 
The doorknob TURNS, but just as the door starts to open NELL FLAILS FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME. 
The door jams against it.  Nell jumps back.  Theo grabs her back into -- 
INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
-- her bedroom and slams the door.  A long, deadly silent moment. 
NELL (cont'd) It's in my room. 
But their BREATH no longer fogs.  Theo seems to notice the fact just as Nell starts for her room and... KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  Behind them. At the door to the hall. 
LUKE (OC) Hey!  I heard screaming... 
THEO Luke. 
She grabs for the door and lets Luke in. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nell's room stands silent, dark.  The door to the bathroom is shut. The lock slides open.  The door swings in.  Luke stands there, the two women behind him. 
Luke turns on the lights.  The room is perfectly ordinary, no sign that anything has been in here.  The door to the hall is shut.  Nell reacts. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Nell and Theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the kitchen table.  Marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital recorder.  Luke paces behind the women. 
NELL You really didn't hear anything? 
Marrow takes his glasses off.  Luke looks at him, then goes to the kitchen sink.  He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up against the sink, arms folded.  Theo and Nell turn to look at him. A beat.  And then: 
BUMP.  Bump bump.  It's the sound.  Luke goes over to the door, pushes it open. 
LUKE Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh Crain! 
INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

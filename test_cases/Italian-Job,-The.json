{"test1_input": "CHARLIE Your Italians. \nSTEVE Yup. Dixie cups. \nCHARLIE Dixie cups? \nSTEVE I toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road. \nEXT. SHIP - NIGHT \nIn ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about the mysterious crate. \nOne Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open. \nIt is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one. \nNods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but... \nWatch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the tomatoes... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nOn Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, BEEPING, sending out precise longitude and latitude. \nLYLE For those about to rock, we salute you. \nCharlie dials his cell phone. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - INTERCUT \nHandsome Rob answers. \nHANDSOME ROB Yeah. \nCHARLIE Let's get rich. \nHandsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold. \nHalf-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHIP (DOCKED) - LATER, NIGHT \nThe Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR CAMERA DROPS to -- \nBENEATH THE WATER \nwhere we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon explosive primer to the hull of the ship. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT \nPlowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his bubble gum. \nHANDSOME ROB Can you chill out back there? You'd make a hummingbird nervous. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his gear. \nHALF-EAR I'm done. Over. \nLYLE (V.O.) Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy. \nHalf-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into deeper water. \nCUT TO: \nTWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS \nComing closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags. \nA Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the crate in the ship. \nEXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride. \nThrough the headset inside his gear, he HEARS: \nLYLE (V.O.) Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop. \nHalf-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed by just above his head. WHOOSH. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT \nThe hull of the boat EXPLODES. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD \nA very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through the cavity, vanishing. \nUNDERWATER \nThe huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom. \nON THE SHIP \nChaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water. \nINT. HUMVEE - NIGHT \nParked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to the bay through infrared binoculars. \nThe ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach. \nEXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT \nThe DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting bag that is used to move heavy loads through water. \nThe crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits. \nUsing crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere. \nAnd now we see what was hidden between the boxes... \nA large safe. \nThey move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial. \nJohn peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels of the combination lock... until the door pops open. \nAs they stare at what's inside, they speak into their headsets, heard by all. \nCHARLIE Sweet Jesus. \nJOHN BRIDGER \"That for which all virtue is sold. And almost every vice -- gold.\" \nAnd now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're talking thirty million dollars worth of gold. \nINT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT \nThey holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared binoculars and sees -- \nThe last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then disappear. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER \nThe gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag. \nThey attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves which cause the parachute to INFLATE. \nLooking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, going along for the ride. \nThen Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through the water towards the secluded beach, we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN \nThe Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) \nThe gold is in three crates in the cargo bay. \nHandsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who abstains. He holds up his empty cup. \nJOHN BRIDGER My name is John and I'm a very rich alcoholic. And I'm going to live my life one very rich day at a time. \nTHE CREW Alright, John! \nThey laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As Bridger lights it for him -- \nJOHN BRIDGER You planned this one down to a t, kid. It's a gift. You saw the big picture, made contingencies, covered the angles... \n", "test1_id": 2355, "test2_input": "HANDSOME ROB (scowls) Y'got a great job. \nBURLY MAN Pays the rent, asshole. You got a problem, talk to Skinny Pete. \nHe opens the door to the -- \nINT. BACK ROOM \nWhere we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the room. \nHis catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer. \nSKINNY PETE Philly Steak sent you? \nHis voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort just for this guy to get out the words. \nHALF-EAR That's right. \nSKINNY PETE So was I right-on about the gold bricks or what? \nHALF-EAR That's really not what I'm here to talk about. Philly Steak said you could get us some supplies. \nThe fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins colliding like a train wreck. \nSKINNY PETE What do you need? \nHALF-EAR A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon primer. Detonating cord. Two triple charger chemical grenades. Launcher. \nSKINNY PETE Nine p.m. \nHANDSOME ROB Should we hang here? Check out the dancers? \nSKINNY PETE Nothing's going down here. I don't shit in my own yard, do you? \nHANDSOME ROB No, but I take a whizz off the deck sometimes. \nWith his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address. \nSKINNY PETE Five thousand dollars. And don't be late. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY \nLooking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside. \nINT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) \nStella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her features. Lyle is hidden in the back. \nShe parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention to -- \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE \nwhere Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs immediately back off. \nStella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at her. \nShe comes face to face with the man who killed her father. \nSTEVE It's all right. They won't bother you now. \nShe's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this off. \nSTELLA It's okay. I'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job. \nHe holds out a hand. \nSTEVE I'm Steve. \nSTELLA Becky. \nShe shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a moment. \nSTELLA You want to show me the problem? \nSTEVE Yeah. Course. This way. \nINT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nShe enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a full sweep of the entryway. \nSTELLA I'd like to check the cable modem first. \n", "test2_true": "Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole camera and hears them talking through his headphones. \nINT.

Then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer. \nHe stares at her as she bends down... \nSTEVE The cable guy who hooked this up weighed about 300 pounds, didn't wear any underwear, and his pants slung a little too low if you know what I mean. \nShe tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his words. \nSTELLA There we go. Now onto the TVs. \nINT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY \nLyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks down it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nHe escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to the plasma TV. Finishes. \nSTEVE Is it fixed? \nSTELLA Turn it on and see. \nEXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME \nBack at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable. \nWearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle -- \nLYLE (V.O.) Now. \nCharlie reconnects the cable just as -- \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSteve turns on the TV and the picture is -- \nSTEVE Perfect. \nSTELLA Then it looks like you're all set. \nSteve stares at her a moment. \nSTEVE Have we met before? \nShe's hoping to get out as quickly as she can. \nSTELLA I don't think so. Sign here, please. \nShe hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it. \nSTELLA Date. \nSTEVE You read my mind. \nSTELLA Oh, no. I meant that I need you to put the date by your signature. It's the 26th. \nSTEVE I know what you meant. (he smiles) This might seem a little sudden, but... would you like to have dinner with me? \nSTELLA I don't think that'd be a very good idea. \nSTEVE Why? Is there some kind of cable- rule against dating customers? \nSTELLA No, it's my rule. I don't accept dates from men I've just met. I've only known you five minutes. \nSTEVE Then I guess I'll have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better. \nHe's being charming, and she has to act like he is being charming, but she really wants to throw-up. \nSTEVE Look, I'm just talking about dinner. Friday night. It's no big deal. If you don't like me, you never have to see me again. You know I'm not going to stop until you say yes. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 2356, "test3_input": "INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY \nStella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle are in the back. \nCHARLIE I know it was tough in there. \nSTELLA He touched my hand. And he came-on to me. That slimy, disgusting man came onto me and I had to pretend that I liked it. \nStella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her cheek. She wipes it away. \nSTELLA You do know what this means... I've created our window of opportunity. \nCHARLIE I know. When Steve leaves Friday night, we go in. By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT \nA different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the gut: you don't belong here. \nINT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) \nHandsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat. \nHALF-EAR Skinny Pete. \nHANDSOME ROB The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches' diet. \nThey pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete sent them to. \nHALF-EAR What do you think? \nHANDSOME ROB I'm trying not to. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in response and they go inside. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nClimbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is inside. \nThey go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for just a peek. He sees the goods. \nHandsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the other side of the door and disappears. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk. \nHALF-EAR Drive slow. We crash and we're a crater. \nThey get into the car. \nINT. RENTAL CAR \nHandsome Rob keys the ignition. \nThe beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass. \nHalf-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches the weapon. \nHOMEBOY What'd you put in the trunk? \nHALF-EAR Suitcase. \nThe homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with. \nHOMEBOY Just gimme the keys before I pop a cap in your head. \nHandsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted floor. \nHOMEBOY Hurry up! \nHalf-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior of the door. \nThe homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns it. \nThe other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass shatters. \nINT. TRUNK OF THE CAR \nBullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the suitcase filled with explosives. \n", "test3_true": "The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife. \nHis legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the pavement. \nThe car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over. \nThe U-Haul is waiting for them. \nThey get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch closer and they would've been a crater. \nHALF-EAR Christ. \nINT. U-HAUL - NIGHT \nThey get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel, he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off, leaving the shot-up rental car behind. \nCHARLIE Looks like that went without a hitch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nAn edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around. \nCHARLIE Lyle, what's the distance from the front door to the vault? \nLyle doesn't answer. \nCHARLIE Lyle? \nHandsome Rob leans over to Charlie. \nHANDSOME ROB He only answers to The Napster now. \nCHARLIE I'm not calling you The Napster. \nLYLE You call him Half-Ear. \nHALF-EAR That wasn't my idea. \nLYLE And him, Handsome Rob. \nCHARLIE That's only cause he is Handsome Rob. \nLYLE And I'm The Napster. \nCHARLIE How far? (sighs, gives in) The Napster. \nLYLE Five hundred yards. \nCHARLIE So here's the riddle. How do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car? \nSTELLA How wide is the hallway? \nThe video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop. \nLyle calculates: \nLYLE Only six feet. \nOUR VIEW PUSHES IN FAST on Stella. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nMINI COOPER (MOVING) - DAY \nShe's driving. Pure concentration. Then: \nTires spinning over a marble floor. Then: \nThe sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper.

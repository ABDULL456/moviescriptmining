{"train": "\"THE ITALIAN JOB\" \nScreenplay by \nDonna Powers and Wayne Powers \nBased on the 1969 screenplay by \nTroy Kennedy-Martin \nDecember 21, 2001 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT \nForklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and cacophony of a major seaport. \nWe FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries it onto a ship. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nThrough night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew but he's a born leader. \nCHARLIE Lyle? \nSWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop. \nLYLE I've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal. That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds time accuracy. \nSWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant confidence mixed with the hint of a smile. \nSTEVE Why can't he talk like a person? \nCHARLIE ...Because he's not. \nLYLE I do need one more thing, Charlie. \nCHARLIE What's that? \nLYLE Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on. No signal, no score. \nCHARLIE (to Steve) Where're the Italians? \nSTEVE Patience. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - SAME TIME \nThe driver is HANDSOME ROB, 30. Riding shotgun is HALF-EAR, 35, immersed in a book: Albert Einstein Creator & Rebel. \nHalf-Ear is a large black man with a Southern accent and a hearing aid. \nHANDSOME ROB What's that shit? \nHALF-EAR A book. It's called reading. You should try it some time. \nHandsome Rob holds up three fingers. \nHANDSOME ROB You wanna read something. Read between the lines. \nHALF-EAR Well here's something even you can relate to. Albert got a lotta trim. That genius thing is a babe magnet. \nHANDSOME ROB Lemme see that book. \nINT. HOTEL JEWELRY SHOP - SAME TIME \nThe final member of the crew, JOHN BRIDGER, 50s, is a tasteful man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on his cell phone. \nSTELLA (V.O.) Hello? \nJOHN BRIDGER Hi, sweetie. \nINT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT \nSTELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel. \nSTELLA Daddy. How are you? \nJOHN BRIDGER I'm sending you something. \nSTELLA Really? Does it smell nice? \nJOHN BRIDGER No. But it's sparkly. \nCHARLIE Your Italians. \nSTEVE Yup. Dixie cups. \nCHARLIE Dixie cups? \nSTEVE I toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road. \nEXT. SHIP - NIGHT \nIn ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about the mysterious crate. \nOne Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open. \nIt is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one. \nNods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but... \nWatch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the tomatoes... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nOn Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, BEEPING, sending out precise longitude and latitude. \nLYLE For those about to rock, we salute you. \nCharlie dials his cell phone. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - INTERCUT \nHandsome Rob answers. \nHANDSOME ROB Yeah. \nCHARLIE Let's get rich. \nHandsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold. \nHalf-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHIP (DOCKED) - LATER, NIGHT \nThe Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR CAMERA DROPS to -- \nBENEATH THE WATER \nwhere we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon explosive primer to the hull of the ship. \nINT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT \nPlowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his bubble gum. \nHANDSOME ROB Can you chill out back there? You'd make a hummingbird nervous. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his gear. \nHALF-EAR I'm done. Over. \nLYLE (V.O.) Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy. \nHalf-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into deeper water. \nCUT TO: \nTWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS \nComing closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags. \nA Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the crate in the ship. \nEXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride. \nThrough the headset inside his gear, he HEARS: \nLYLE (V.O.) Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop. \nHalf-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed by just above his head. WHOOSH. \nA car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives it the legendary Mini look. \nIf when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile soul. \nINT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY \nStella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling. \nShe searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs. \nSees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in. \nBrake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with ease. She's right in front of -- \nHER SHOP \nAntique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a poised walk she heads inside. \nINT. SHOP - DAY \nIt is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her. \nRECEPTIONIST How long? \nSTELLA Four minutes, forty-three seconds. \nHigh-five. \nRECEPTIONIST You're the man. \nSTELLA So what's on the line-up? \nRECEPTIONIST 2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler. \nSTELLA Tell him if I don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on me. \nRECEPTIONIST And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each other. (an aside) And he looks pretty fine for a white boy. \nWithout a response, Stella heads over to -- \nHER OPEN OFFICE DOOR \nand sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that line the shelves. \nSTELLA Charlie Croker. \nHe turns around. Smiles. Charming. \nCHARLIE Hi, Stella. \nShe steps inside. \nSTELLA Refresh my memory. After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, I told you I never wanted to see you again, didn't I? \nCHARLIE Yeah. You did. \nSTELLA So I'm a little confused. \nCHARLIE I found him. \nAt first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling. \nCHARLIE I can tell you where he is. \nSTELLA I don't want to know. \nCHARLIE Are you sure? \nShe doesn't answer. \nCHARLIE He's in Los Angeles. \nShe doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to. So he goes on... \nCHARLIE The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak. \nStella remembers him. \nSTELLA When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find. \nCHARLIE He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time. \nSTELLA You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase? \nSuddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking Richard's suit in red wine. \nBUSBOY Oh, man. I'm sorry. \nRICHARD You should be. Moron. What the hell's wrong with you? \nBUSBOY It was an accident. I'm very sorry. \nRICHARD Where's the manager? Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned. Damn. (to Stella) I'm going to... I don't believe this. \nHe starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he was occupying empties, Charlie fills it. \nCHARLIE I think your date's going pretty well, what do you think? \nShe shoots him a look that could reverse global warming. \nSTELLA What are you doing here? \nCHARLIE What do you mean? I come here all the time. \nSTELLA I don't think so. \nCHARLIE Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of crowd. See that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once. We need to talk. \nSTELLA No, you need to listen. I want you to leave. Got it? \nCHARLIE Hey, I paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper. \nSTELLA You -- I don't believe this. You paid someone to spill that drink? \nCHARLIE Actually, you paid for it. \nCharlie returns her wallet. \nCHARLIE Didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for Los Angeles. I already booked your flight. \nSTELLA You truly are a fatuous, odious man. \nCHARLIE I have no idea what you just said, but I like the sound of it. \nSTELLA Well maybe you'll understand this. Hit the road, Jack -- \nCHARLIE Charlie -- \nSTELLA Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels. \nShe means it, too. \nCHARLIE I'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship. \nSTELLA I'll let you in on a secret. You can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief. \nCharlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine. \nCHARLIE John wasn't just a man I crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father I ever had. I wish to God I could bring him back. But all I can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives. \nShe feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, they're interrupted by -- \nRICHARD Everything alright, Stella? \nHe's back, red wine splotched on his suit. \nSTELLA Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was just saying goodbye. \nBut for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into to him... \nRICHARD Can I help you with something? \nCHARLIE Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you with my eyes. \nAnd with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile. \nEXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT \nShe comes home, having shed her date. \nINT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't looked at for years. She opens it. \nInside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes. \nINT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCHARLIE (V.O.) One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many. \nSome kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing. \nKID That was rad! \nHALF-EAR Wha'? \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. MINI - DAY \nAnd now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious custom work done to it. \nCHARLIE Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nEXT. L.A. FREEWAY - 1999 - DAY \nHandsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out his open window -- \nWe watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled with cop cars in pursuit. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Smashed the mark by twelve minutes. \nWe now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news helicopter camera. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) He got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on TV. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. MINI - DAY \nAs the cars converge in the parking lot... \nSTELLA And what about you? \nCHARLIE I've been a thief since I had baby teeth. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY \nSEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY. \nBULLY Cough it up, Charlie! \nCharlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye. \nCLASSMATE So much for lunch. \nSEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE You need a dollar? \nCLASSMATE I thought he took your last one. \nSEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE He did. \nCharlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed from the bully. \nSEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE But I got lots more now. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nDoors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. Charlie gets right down to business. \nCHARLIE This is Stella. She's working with us on this one. IDs? \nHandsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses. \nLYLE (reading his) Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name? \nHALF-EAR (also complaining) 220 pounds? Try 180. \nHANDSOME ROB Try 'Deal A Meal'. \nLYLE I don't even have a cool nickname. \nCHARLIE Enough of this sewing-circle shit. Phones. \nHalf-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their old phones. \nHalf-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence that surrounds the perimeter of the property. \nHALF-EAR (into recorder) We've got an anti-scaling fence. Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw won't work. We'll need Nitramon. \nThe binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps an eye on the gate. \nHALF-EAR Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in the holster. Security booth is accessible and ideal for a triple charger chemical grenade. \nThe binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the grounds. \nHALF-EAR Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. Because dogs are racist. That's a natural fact. Someone else deal with 'em. \nEXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY \nA sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car. \nINT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING) \nTiming out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn. \nINT. U-HAUL - DAY \nLyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front door. \nLYLE (into micro cassette player) Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. Monitors 132 points for intrusion, fire, and environmental hazards. Best way around it is to get a back door password, trip the alarm during the heist, then call it in as a false alarm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY \nA HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks. \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY \nThe same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last saw him, his beard shaved away. \nINT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME \nThrough his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's the first time he's seen Steve in three years. \nLYLE (into micro cassette recorder) 15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 to 20 pounds living off our money. And Handsome Rob, you're going to be pissed when you see his wheels. \nLyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in reverse. The Ferrari zooms away. \nEXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY \nAnother route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn lane waiting for the light to change. \nINT. RENTAL CAR \nThe light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late as she makes it through the light but he doesn't. \nHe checks his stopwatch. Simmers. \nEXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY \nIn a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, reading a copy of Vogue magazine. \nBut as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's inserted in the fold of Vogue. \nINT. U-HAUL - DAY \nCharlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her car. \nCHARLIE (into micro cassette recorder) Housekeeper leaves at 17:30. \nEXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING \nSteve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer that Philly Steak told Charlie about. \nYEVHEN You're right on time. \nINT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING \nYevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive -- \nYEVHEN All those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do they think -- that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government? I don't think so. \nSteve motions to a security camera that looms down on them. \nSTEVE Is the camera off? \nYEVHEN Of course. Just like you said. I never tape you, you can see for yourself. \nService trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting out, finishing their shifts. \nINT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY) \nHandsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his digital camera at the exiting workers. \nLYLE I'm telling you. He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his. But I know the real reason. It's because I was NAPPING when he stole the idea from me. I should've been on the cover of Wired magazine. \nHANDSOME ROB Would you clam up. You'd give a woodpecker a headache. \nLYLE I'm the Napster. \nHANDSOME ROB Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: cable chick. \nThey see a female service tech getting out of her work truck. \nLyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast. \nLYLE Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she calls the other one. \nHANDSOME ROB And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend. \nLYLE I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind. (tapping his head) That woman's lived in here rent-free for four years. \nLyle takes a few more pictures of Becky. \nLYLE Okay. All we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one. You think Stella will be able to pull it off? \nHANDSOME ROB I have my doubts, but there's no talking to Charlie. \nLYLE Maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software. Clouds the judgment. \nHANDSOME ROB He knows better than to mix business with pleasure. (getting out of the car) Only I'm allowed to do that. \nLYLE Where you going? \nHANDSOME ROB To get a work shirt and a service truck. \nLyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is Handsome Rob for a reason. \nINT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nOUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His eyes flash open. \nHe slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her pants and removes her key chain. \nHe selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges. \nHe returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past her panties, past her bra and. \nHe snags her work shirt. Then he's gone. \nINT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nUsing locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the impression on the candle wax. \nEXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN \nStella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the door to the cable truck and gets in. \nEXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING \nThe cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the back where they can't be seen. \nEXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING \nThe cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street from Steve's house. \nCharlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers to disconnect one of the cables. \nINT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nHe drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but snow. \nHe goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV. \nThe cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom button on his telephone. \nINT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT \nA SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom. \nSECURITY GUARD What can I do for you, Mister Frezelli? \nHANDSOME ROB (scowls) Y'got a great job. \nBURLY MAN Pays the rent, asshole. You got a problem, talk to Skinny Pete. \nHe opens the door to the -- \nINT. BACK ROOM \nWhere we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the room. \nHis catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer. \nSKINNY PETE Philly Steak sent you? \nHis voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort just for this guy to get out the words. \nHALF-EAR That's right. \nSKINNY PETE So was I right-on about the gold bricks or what? \nHALF-EAR That's really not what I'm here to talk about. Philly Steak said you could get us some supplies. \nThe fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins colliding like a train wreck. \nSKINNY PETE What do you need? \nHALF-EAR A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon primer. Detonating cord. Two triple charger chemical grenades. Launcher. \nSKINNY PETE Nine p.m. \nHANDSOME ROB Should we hang here? Check out the dancers? \nSKINNY PETE Nothing's going down here. I don't shit in my own yard, do you? \nHANDSOME ROB No, but I take a whizz off the deck sometimes. \nWith his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address. \nSKINNY PETE Five thousand dollars. And don't be late. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY \nLooking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside. \nINT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) \nStella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her features. Lyle is hidden in the back. \nShe parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention to -- \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE \nwhere Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs immediately back off. \nStella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at her. \nShe comes face to face with the man who killed her father. \nSTEVE It's all right. They won't bother you now. \nShe's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this off. \nSTELLA It's okay. I'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job. \nHe holds out a hand. \nSTEVE I'm Steve. \nSTELLA Becky. \nShe shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a moment. \nSTELLA You want to show me the problem? \nSTEVE Yeah. Course. This way. \nINT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nShe enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a full sweep of the entryway. \nSTELLA I'd like to check the cable modem first. \nINT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY \nStella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle are in the back. \nCHARLIE I know it was tough in there. \nSTELLA He touched my hand. And he came-on to me. That slimy, disgusting man came onto me and I had to pretend that I liked it. \nStella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her cheek. She wipes it away. \nSTELLA You do know what this means... I've created our window of opportunity. \nCHARLIE I know. When Steve leaves Friday night, we go in. By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT \nA different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the gut: you don't belong here. \nINT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) \nHandsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat. \nHALF-EAR Skinny Pete. \nHANDSOME ROB The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches' diet. \nThey pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete sent them to. \nHALF-EAR What do you think? \nHANDSOME ROB I'm trying not to. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in response and they go inside. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nClimbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is inside. \nThey go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for just a peek. He sees the goods. \nHandsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the other side of the door and disappears. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nHalf-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk. \nHALF-EAR Drive slow. We crash and we're a crater. \nThey get into the car. \nINT. RENTAL CAR \nHandsome Rob keys the ignition. \nThe beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass. \nHalf-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches the weapon. \nHOMEBOY What'd you put in the trunk? \nHALF-EAR Suitcase. \nThe homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with. \nHOMEBOY Just gimme the keys before I pop a cap in your head. \nHandsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted floor. \nHOMEBOY Hurry up! \nHalf-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior of the door. \nThe homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns it. \nThe other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass shatters. \nINT. TRUNK OF THE CAR \nBullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the suitcase filled with explosives. \nLYLE But he ran into me. \nHANDSOME ROB He's not driving either. (to Stella) You ever got a speeding ticket? \nSTELLA Let's put it this way: I can only get insurance through companies that advertise on TV at 3:00 in the morning. \nHANDSOME ROB You drive. I drive. Charlie drives. \nCHARLIE I got us spots for three cars on a car carrier and five first class seats. Train 59 from Union Station to New Orleans. \nHALF-EAR That's N'Or'lins, Yankee. \nCHARLIE What's the word on Rockefeller? \nLYLE The Traffic Control Center is on the top floor of a building on Olympic and Grand. They get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors. That info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights. So all I have to do now is change the data by creating my own algorithm. \nCHARLIE What can I do to help? \nLYLE I need to hard-wire into the mainframes. \nEXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT \nHoused in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle. \nOUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of steps into the \nINT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT \nFrom an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent. \nINT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT \nCharlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight. \nINT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nA high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the large traffic information monitors that display multiple images. \nOUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the -- \nOTHER SIDE OF THE WALL \nWhere the 70\" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie and Lyle have already snuck inside. \nThey move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the computers. The laptop's screen lights up. \nCharlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels. \nHe punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors. \nTyping commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher bandwidth than the rest us. \nLYLE B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's linear discriminant function coefficients, SpdRat is the speed ratio, and TTratio is the travel time ratio. \nCHARLIE I have no idea what you're doing. Just do it fast. \nThere. \nHe hits the ENTER button. \nLYLE We own this place. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE PANTRY RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN L.A. - DAY \nTheir motto: \"Never closed. Never without a customer!\" The place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen. \nMASHKOV $2000. And this is the new girl. Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's guys picked her up hitchhiking downtown. \nThe detective checks out the photo. \nDETECTIVE Those tits'd make Dracula rise from his coffin at high-noon. \nMASHKOV They're all yours Saturday. You can do whatever you want to her. Her name is Karen... \nDETECTIVE You're too generous. \nMASHKOV I needed a fast answer. \nDETECTIVE And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy who works the counter at your cousin's shop told me that someone named Skinny Pete had been asking around about gold bricks with the face of a Balinese girl on them. Same gold bricks your cousin was buying. \nMASHKOV You talked to this Skinny Pete? \nLYLE For those about to rock, we salute you. \nEXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT \nFrom side streets, the Minis converge on the road and head up towards Steve's house. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT \nHe can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through is body. \nCHARLIE This is it, guys. Moment of truth. \nHe takes a sharp curve... and the moment that Steve's house should come into view... he hits the brakes, his expression turning to complete surprise. \nHIS POV \nThe neighbor across the street from Steve is having the biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's house in the midst of this. \nCHARLIE'S FACE \nAs he takes this in, there's a KNOCK on the window. He turns. Sees a uniformed VALET. Rolls down the window. \nVALET Are you hear for the Baxter party, sir? \nEXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT \nWe see the three Minis pull tight U-turns and head back the way they came. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT \nHe slaps his hand against the steering wheel, fuming. \nCHARLIE Shit. Stella? \nINT. STELLA'S MINI (MOVING) - INTERCUT \nShe already knows what he's going to say. \nSTELLA I know. I've got a date tonight. \nCHARLIE You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his jokes. You need him to ask you out again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the date. They're sitting at an intimate table. \nSTELLA You really make laugh. \nHe takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think it is. \nSTEVE So here's what I have lined up for after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. The Ferrari always gets me to the front of the line. We'll do a little dancing... \nSTELLA Not tonight. I don't want to be out late. \nSTEVE Why the curfew? \nSTELLA Let's just say I've made some wrong calls in the past. I like to take things slow, cautious. Next time... \nSTEVE I understand. You have nothing to worry about. You can trust me. \nSTELLA I trust everyone. It's the devil inside them that I don't trust. \nThat saying strikes Steve. \nSTEVE That's an interesting saying. \nSTELLA What? \nHe looks at her closely, really closely. \nSTEVE There's only person I've ever heard say that. Used to say it all the time. \nThis worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it from her father. \nSTELLA Who was that? \nUnder the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like a vise. \nSTEVE A man named John Bridger. Where did you pick up that phrase? \nSTELLA Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting me. \nHANDSOME ROB Good news? \nCHARLIE Sometimes when you're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp. \nHANDSOME ROB Meaning what the fuck? \nCHARLIE We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe. Now the safe is coming to us. We'll boost it in transit. \nHe might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before sunrise. \nHANDSOME ROB Charlie. He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour. \nCHARLIE We're already set to do it. Napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles? \nLYLE Keep talking. \nCHARLIE You gridlock every route except the one we choose. Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go. \nHANDSOME ROB But where do we want it? We can't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to Union Station. We're outmanned and outgunned. \nCHARLIE But not outsmarted. \nCharlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and twitching with eagerness to run, he is \"on the muscle.\" That describes Charlie right now. \nCHARLIE We'll do it like the Italian job. We'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight. \nThey're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This throws them all off. \nCHARLIE Who else has this number? \nHALF-EAR No one but us. \nIt's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it. \nCHARLIE Hello? \nINT. OFFICE - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT \nMeet PHILLY STEAK. Or at least meet the back of his neck. \nBecause that's where he has a tatoo that says PHILLY STEAK. \nPHILLY STEAK Why'd you do it? \nCHARLIE (informing the crew) Philly Steak. (then into phone) Do what? \nOUR CAMERA TRACKS AROUND to Philly Steak's face which is weathered and as leathery as a football. An old school crook. \nPHILLY STEAK Yevhen. The Ukrainian gold, dealer. You didn't, have to clip him, for Christ's sakes. \nCHARLIE Clip him? \nPHILLY STEAK Listen to me. You've gotta get out of L.A. Now. \nCHARLIE What're you talking about? We didn't clip anybody. \nPHILLY STEAK Well Skinny Pete just called me. Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did. \nCHARLIE Why does he think that? \nPHILLY STEAK Because you wanted, to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl. Plus I guess Pete was under duress. This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul Fucking Bunyan. \nCHARLIE Do you know how to get in touch with him? \nPHILLY STEAK Yeah but... \nCHARLIE Maybe there's a way we can play this to our advantage. \nPHILLY STEAK Are you out of your mind? Listen to me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. Cause if there's one thing I know, it's that you never mess with Mother Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother- fucking Ukrainians. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - MORNING \nSpeaking of -- Five Ukrainians lock 'n load their MAC-11 machine pistols plus an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade launcher mounted beneath the barrel. Mashkov enters the room and tells the others in SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN. \nMASHKOV He's going to be on Train 59 for New Orleans. \nUKRAINIAN You sure your source is good? \nMASHKOV I'm sure. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANYA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nJob done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall. \nCharlie just shakes his head in disbelief. \nHALF-EAR My work here is done. \nEXT. OPORTO DRIVE -DAY \nA Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked by two BMW K1200LTA motorcycles. \nEXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME \nThrough binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on Steve's house from the higher vantage point. \nHIS POV \nThe front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are let inside and head up the driveway. \nBut then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by motorcycles turns into the driveway. \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE \nIt's a convoy of matching armored trucks... \nEXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY \nWitnessing the twist of events through his binoculars. He speaks into his headset mic -- \nHANDSOME ROB Problemo. \nINT. U-HAUL - INTERCUT \nThe rest of the crew is now all in the U-Haul. Lyle's manning the laptop. \nCHARLIE What is it? \nHANDSOME ROB He's brought in three identical armored trucks. \nCHARLIE Shit. Decoys. It's like a shell game on wheels. \nLYLE How can I reroute the truck if I don't know which truck to reroute? \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - (TIME CUT) - DAY \nThe caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind. \nEXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY \nHandsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports into his mike: \nHANDSOME ROB Three Brink's trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts, plus Steve in his Ferrari. \nINT. U-HAUL \nMaddening frustration. \nLYLE How're we going to figure out which truck has the gold? \nCharlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always comes up with an idea. \nCHARLIE You can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop, right? \nLYLE Yeah. \nCHARLIE Where's the first camera the trucks will go past? \nLyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is mounted to. \nLYLE Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to cross that. \nCHARLIE The weight of the gold will lower the suspension on the truck. \nEXT. CAHUENGA BOULEVARD - DAY \nThe first armored truck makes its way through the green light. \nINT. U-HAUL \nLyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across the image of the Brink's truck. He strikes another key, momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard street sign. \nLYLE Lines up with the top of the sign. Next... \nHe unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign. \nHe turns on the radio as -- \nINT. U-HAUL \nLyle's fingers dance across the keyboard. \nLYLE Opening up a space on North Highland. \nINT. GOLD TRUCK \nStuck in the middle of it. The driver and guard, both armed, are as confused as everyone else. \nGUARD Get us out of here. \nDRIVER I'm trying. \nHe sees a way out, a sudden opening on North. Highland. \nINT. U-HAUL \nVia a traffic video camera, Lyle sees on his laptop the gold truck, followed by two motorcycles, making the turn onto North Highland. \nLYLE He's taking it... \nLyle hits more keys. \nLYLE I now command you to turn left. \nEXT. GOLD TRUCK \nIt comes to the next intersection. Every light is stuck on red -- except the left turn only signal which is green. No choice. The truck takes it. \nINT. U-HAUL \nHe's striking keys, an orchestral conductor, the crew his audience. \nLYLE I've got it on Hollywood Boulevard. Time to slow down. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD \nSignals turn green, but only for three seconds, long enough for one car to gun through it at a time. \nAt the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and climb into the first Mini. Stella gets into the second Mini. \nHalf-Ear joins Handsome Rob in the third. \nINT. FERRARI - DAY \nSteve gets the scoop over the radio. He can't believe it. \nCHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.) According to the police, the computers at the Traffic Control Center are down. \nSteve knows who did that. \nSTEVE Sonovabitch. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI -DAY \nThrough his rearview mirror, Charlie eyes the gold truck creeping closer. \nCHARLIE Gentlemen, start your engines. \nTHREE SHOTS \nStarting their engines-with souped-up, throaty roars: Charlie; Handsome Rob; Stella. \nCHARLIE Give us the flag when you're ready. \nINT. U-HAUL \nLyle has hacked into the Metro Rail's Control System. Starts his magic. \nLYLE Shutting down the rail as we speak. \nINT. METRO RAIL TUNNELS - SEVERAL SHOTS \nA Metro is speeding through the Blue Line tunnel. Suddenly it loses power and comes to an inglorious stop. \nAnother Metro stops on the Red Line. \nInside a Metro on the Westside Corridor as it stops; confused passengers stare out the glass. \nINT. U-HAUL \nINT. U-HAUL - ON THE CUT \nLyle hits a button on a remote control and -- \nEXT. U-HAUL \nClamps unlock, releasing the heavy steel sheet from the side of the U-Haul. It SLAMS DOWN, neatly covering the gaping hole in the road like a huge manhole cover. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND \nThe motorcycles following the Brink's come to a sudden stop. \nThe motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear. The armored truck has vanished! Vaporized in the gridlock! Gone! \nPandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and sprints away from the explosion. \nLyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him... \nThe sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition. \nAt the same time, the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes. Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders flee. \nThe BMW tears out of there, Lyle behind the wheel. \nINT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY \nThe rear door to the Brink's is open. Our crew sees the Worthington 1000 inside. \nCHARLIE Nice work. \nHALF-EAR Well like Einstein almost said: genius is ten percent inspiration, ninety percent detonation. \nCHARLIE Let's get our gold. \nStella goes up to the imposing safe. Gives it a look of momentary respect, then sets to work... \nINT. KNX-AM 1070 TRAFFIC HELICOPTER - DAY \nChristina Griego telling her radio audience: \nCHRISTINA GRIEGO I've seen earthquakes, mudslides, fires, riots, but this... Let me try to paint a picture for our listeners. \nINT. FERRARI \nHearing the news over the radio. \nCHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.) There's been some kind of an explosion and a Brink's truck has just dropped down into the Metro Rail Blue Line. \nSteve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk, passing the gridlock. He hollers into a walkie-talkie -- \nSTEVE The truck's in the Metro Rail. Where does the Blue Line go back above ground? \nEXT. STREETS - SERIES OF SHOTS \nThe motorcycle guards who were escorting the decoy trucks hear Steve over their walkie-talkies. With squeals of rubber, they turn around as one of the guards answers -- \nMOTORCYCLE GUARD It comes out at Flower & Pico. \nAt the same time -- \nINT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY \nStella works the dial, feeling for contact points. And -- \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - DAY \nThe two motorcycle guards fervently try to lift off the steel sheet that dropped down from the U-Haul. \nINT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY \nThey see daylight start to stream in from above as the steel sheet slides a little. \nCHARLIE Stella? \nSTELLA Shhh... \nWe HEAR Stella's heart pounding in her ears. See the perspiration on her fingertips. \nSTELLA You know when you said this wouldn't be the same as opening a safe for the cops? \nHANDSOME ROB Yeah. \nSTELLA Did you have to be right? \nEXT. CHARLIE'S MINI \nTurning onto Exposition, the motorcycle in pursuit, the chopper overhead. \nHis red Mini jumps a curve, now on a wide sidewalk, accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI \nHe sees someone give him the finger. Mutters: \nCHARLIE If you don't like how I'm driving, get off the damn sidewalk. \nMeanwhile: \nINT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI \nHe's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE dogging his every move. \nHe shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close. \nSuddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of the: \nEXT. CONVENTION CENTER \nHis white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle still right behind. \nINT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI \nUp ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention Center. Stomps the gas. \nHALF-EAR What are you doing? \nThe turbine howls. \nHALF-EAR What -- are -- you -- doing? \nEXT. CONVENTION CENTER \nThe Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the -- \nINT. CONVENTION CENTER \nIt's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing. \nDisplay tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as -- \nThe motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really on now. \nTHUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps. \nWaves of people flee the path of the little car and -- \nTHUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind. \nThe Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into the carpeting. \nINT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI \nHe shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles. \nHALF-EAR Go that way! \nHandsome Rob turns, taking them down the -- \nWEST HALL \nthat stretches out toward the Staples Center. \nWHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by. \nThen -- \nThe Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and -- \nEXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER \nIt bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out. \nINT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY \nThe Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby. \nDown an aisle that leads right to -- \nLyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union Station. Clear sailing for him. \nHe sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman. \nLYLE Where are you going? \nKAREN Away. \nLYLE How about far, far away? \nKAREN The farther the better. \nEXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY \nCharlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed right at him. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI \nHe jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel Figueroa. \nWith the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers \n(it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.) \nSuddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the Mini. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI \nHe's got no place else to go... \nINT. HOTEL FIGUEROA \nThe Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted palm trees. \nThe motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The elevator door opens. Some tourists step off. \nCHARLIE Going up? \nINT. ELEVATOR \nThe Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches out the window, presses the button for ROOF. \nHe sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer. \nThe door closes just in time. \nA second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people screaming at the sight of the guns. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - DAY \nThe doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins. \nLOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow strip. Each tower has its own elevator. \nINT. CHARLIE'S MINI \nHe wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even the Mini couldn't squeeze through. \nIn his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not about to abandon ship. \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nSo he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the first tower and in -- \nEYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS \nHis car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a football... \nNEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP \nThe Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING. \nAnd here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it forward -- \nI/E CHARLIE'S MINI \nHe speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to the last elevator, skids to a stop. \nHe reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his shoulder to witness -- \nTHE MOTORCYCLE \ngoing full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump. \n", "test1_input": "Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous. \nJOHN BRIDGER Shit, you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun. Who else could've pulled that off? \nCHARLIE You could've. I had big shoes to fill. \nJOHN BRIDGER Fill the shoes but don't follow the footprints. \nCHARLIE What're you talking about? You've lived the life. \nJOHN BRIDGER My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers. This is the only thing that's real. \nBridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in his wallet. \nCHARLIE Stella's a beautiful girl. \nJOHN BRIDGER She's amazing. And I spent half her childhood in prison. This is a once in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring down the curtain after this one. Make a new life. Find someone amazing and be there for her. \nAs the advice escapes Bridger's mouth -- \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD \nA Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it. \nHANDSOME ROB Shit. \nClick. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed against Handsome Rob's temple. \nSTEVE Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield. \nThey see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK- 47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them. \nON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start. \nCHARLIE What the hell do you think you're doing? \nSTEVE Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself. \nThe Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the Humvee. \nCHARLIE You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move. \nSTEVE Think so? Well you're the brilliant one. The Master Planner. Isn't that so, John? \nSteve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, the AK-47s aimed at the others. \nSTEVE You bet on the wrong horse. \nJOHN BRIDGER We'll hunt you down. You're gonna regret this. \nEXT. HUMVEE \nSafely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger. \nSTEVE No regrets, Dixie cup. \nBOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that. \nThe Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of full automatic fire at the crew. \nINT. HUMVEE \nThey duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire. \nGlass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter of hell. \nHandsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas. \nDriving blind. \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD \nThe Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, metal tearing against metal. \nThe Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff and the raging water below. \nThe gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires. \nEXT. HUMVEE \nIt almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber. \nIt careens off the road and -- \n", "test1_true": "The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the raging river. \nINT. HUMVEE \nWater cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS. \nOnly their chests and heads are above water. And that's not all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD. \nEXT. WATERFALL \nThe Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over. \nIt cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser of water. \nIt sinks out of sight. \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME \nThe crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve climbs in, leaving the crew for dead. \nUNDERWATER - SAME TIME \nThe Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud. \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN \nThe Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud. \nSteve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold. \nINT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME \nThe water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot mists the water red. \nThey manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body and pulls it up with him. \nEXT. RIVER - SUNRISE \nThey drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) If you would have told me that I would spend the next three years searching for Steve Bandell, I would have said that was nothing. Cause I would have spent a lifetime looking for that bastard if I had to. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nSOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the office is the beam of a penlight on the dial. \nGLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for \"contact points\", areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- if you have the touch. \nNEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30. \nSUPERIMPOSE: \nThree Years Later Philadelphia \nShe manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS TURN ON. \nTWO COPS lurk at the doorway. \nFIRST COP You always work in the dark? \nSTELLA Buzz of the fluorescents throws me off. She's all yours. \nThe cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're on the same team. \nSECOND COP Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack it. Neither could Michael Hoyt. \nSTELLA Now you know who to call first. \nFIRST COP You're expensive, Stella. Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs. Goodwill, community service... \nSTELLA Well I do it for the money. I'll send you the bill. \nSECOND COP Don't you want to see what's inside? \nSTELLA I never look. Bye, guys. \nAnd as she walks off, they do look -- at her. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2355, "test2_input": "CHARLIE Minis? \nSTELLA We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station. \nHandsome Rob likes it. \nHANDSOME ROB We'll need three to hold the gold. \nEXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY \nParked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and feel. \nHalf-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another. \nINT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - SAME TIME \nIn the background, a large window overlooks the lot. \nHandsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE. \nHANDSOME ROB I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 in 4.2. \nCOUNTER BABE As long as it's a convertible -- I always like to have my top down. \nAt the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half- Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit. \nCOUNTER BABE Do you know them? \nThey get out of their cars and start yelling at each other. \nHANDSOME ROB Never seen 'em before in my life. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. YEVHEN'S COIN & BULLION STORE - NIGHT \nSteve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store. The steel door rises up and once again Yevhen unlocks another door. \nYEVHEN You're early. \nSTEVE And I'm in a hurry, okay? \nINT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT \nIt doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room. \nYEVHEN Of course the Florida vote rigging was a CIA and Mob operation. \nSTEVE (with total disinterest) That a fact? \nYEVHEN You want facts? Fact: CIA officials were allowed free -- and illegal -- access to official election material. \nSteve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 pounds. \nYEVHEN Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags. \nSTEVE And I'd love to hear more about it, but like I said... \nYEVHEN Don't worry, we'll have you out in no time. The cash is on its way. \nSteve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right. \nSTEVE On its way? \nYEVHEN My cousin is bringing it over. \nSTEVE Your cousin? \nYEVHEN Yes. Cousin Mashkov. \nSTEVE He's on his way? \nYEVHEN Don't worry, he will be here any minute. \nSteve looks up to the security camera. \nSTEVE The tape's off? \nYEVHEN Of course. Believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either. \nSTEVE Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, that I never wanted to meet with anyone but you? \nYevhen sweats a bit. \n", "test2_true": "STEVE And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle. \nYEVHEN But you were early. Please. Don't worry. It will be fine. My cousin's a cool guy. Like I am. \nSTEVE What you are, is a Dixie cup. \nYevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented or insulted. \nYEVHEN Dixie cup? \nBefore the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's face, shattering his jaw. \nYevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD. \nAnd again. \nAnd again. \nHe then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and places it back in his duffle bag. \nCUT TO: \nINT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER \nYevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse. Steve is long gone. \nMashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nMashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where -- \nHis boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE. \nMASHKOV My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death. \nDANYA By who? \nMASHKOV That's what I'm going to find out. \nThey stop talking for a moment as one of the \"ACTRESSES\" comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa Street when he first arrived in L.A. \nDanya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN. \nDANYA And what will you do when you find this piece of shit who killed your cousin? \nMASHKOV I'll hack off his limbs and bury him while he's still alive. \nDANYA Okay. But now we should stop talking Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl. (switching to accented ENGLISH) How are you tonight, Karen? \nKAREN Hungry. \nDANYA Then eat your Frosted Flakes. \nKAREN (like Tony the Tiger) They're grrrreat! \nDanya laughs pleasantly. \nDANYA Such a perfect girl. \nBut as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on her face. \nINT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the Minis' trunks as Charlie enters -- \nCHARLIE How are our matchbox cars? \nHANDSOME ROB Souped. \nSTELLA Don't let their size fool you. These were rally cars back in the day. 135 mph, 155 horsepower -- \nLYLE Do I get to drive one? \nHANDSOME ROB No. \nLYLE Why not? \nHANDSOME ROB Because you can't navigate your way out of a parking lot. Here's your ride. \nHe pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear. \n", "test2_id": 2356, "test3_input": "Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini. \nAnother Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini. \nFour more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis. \nThey cock their M-lls. \nCLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK. \nSteve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to see the weapons pointed at him. \nMASHKOV Take out your gun and drop it on the floor. \nSteve has no choice. \nSTEVE Who are you? \nMASHKOV You knew my cousin. Yevhen. \nSTEVE I never knew anyone named Yevhen. \nMASHKOV Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, this one. That gold is for us. A gift from some old friends of yours. They said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, as long as you didn't get any. Not even the toy surprise. \nThe Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini. \nAnd for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, he begs. \nSTEVE Please. Don't shoot me. Please... \nMASHKOV Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. I'm not going to shoot you. \nSTEVE Thank you. Thank God. \nMASHKOV (to the others) He really thought I was going to shoot him. \nThe Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh. \nMASHKOV No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. I'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive. \nAnd with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS. \nINT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME \nUnderneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We BOOM UP to our five thieves... \nCHARLIE New IDs. \nHandsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when they arrive in New Orleans. \nLYLE (re: his fake license) Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name? \nHALF-EAR (also complaining) 250_pounds? \nThey're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He answers. \nCHARLIE Did you get what you wanted? \nINT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT \nMashkov is on the other end of the line. \nMASHKOV I'm happy. \nDuring this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is connected to a phone jack in the car. \nCHARLIE It was good doing business with you. \nLyle hits a final command and -- \nINT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME \nsignal box receives the command and -- \nEXT. CAR CARRIER - SAME TIME \nThe coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train is electronically disengaged. \nThis causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour. \nThe car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended windows for scenic dining.

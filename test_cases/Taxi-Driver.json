On the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space. \nTravis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows.  Not noticed, no reason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings. He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, \"King Kong Company 1968-70\". \nHe has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence. \nFILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE.  Weather-beaten sign above driveway reads, \"Taxi Enter Here\". Yellow cabs scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the curbs, the wind is howling. \nINSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis. Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy breath and exhaust fill the air. \nINT. CORRIDOR of cab company offices. Lettering on ajar door reads: \nPERSONAL OFFICE \nMarvis Cab Company Blue and White Cab Co. Acme Taxi Dependable Taxi Services JRB Cab Company Speedo Taxi Service \nSOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing. \nPERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading \"Marvis, B&W, Acme\" and so forth are tacked to crumbling plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms, reports and an old upright Royal typewriter. \nDishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his desk. \nThe young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette. \nThe PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out of his workaday boredom. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.) No trouble with the Hack Bureau? \nTRAVIS (O.S.) No Sir. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.) Got your license? \nTRAVIS (O.S.) Yes. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER So why do you want to be a taxi driver? \nTRAVIS I can't sleep nights. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER There's porno theatres for that. \nTRAVIS I know. I tried that. \nThe PERSONNEL OFFICER, though officious, is mildly probing and curious.  TRAVIS is a cipher, cold and distant. He speaks as if his mind doesn't know what his mouth is saying. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER So whatja do now? \nTRAVIS I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER We don't need any misfits around here, son. \nA thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips. \nTRAVIS You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night? \nPERSONNEL OFFICER You want to work uptown nights? \nTRAVIS I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER (thinks a moment) How's your driving record? \nTRAVIS Clean. Real clean. (pause, thin smile) As clean as my conscience. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy. I can take in three to three-fifty a week, more with skims. \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up: \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT (urgent) Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it grounded? \nOn seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he answers: \nTRAVIS Why should it be grounded? \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Listen - I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog! \nTRAVIS Then it's a good guess it's grounded. \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie? \nTRAVIS Have you tried the telephone? \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT (hostile, impatient) There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know. \nTRAVIS No. \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here. (points out window) Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog! \nTRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns to hail another taxi. \nMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Taxi! Taxi! \nTravis writes up his trip card and drives away. \nIt is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle. Travis drives trough another section of Manhattan. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) I work the whole city, up, down, don't make no difference to me - does to some. \nSTREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V.  Black PROSTITUTE wearing white vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE. \nTRAVIS pulls over. \nPROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out the action in rear view mirror. \nTRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) Some won't take spooks - Hell, don't make no difference tom me. \nTRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park. \nGRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's probably trying to get him to come off manually. \nJOHN (O.S.) Oh baby, baby. \nPROSTITUTE (O.S.) (forceful) Come on. \nTRAVIS stares blankly ahead. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS' APARTMENT.  CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room, indicating this is not a new scene. \nTRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt, jeans, boots.  An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee can ash tray. \nCLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are those he is saying.  The columns are straight, disciplined. Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting is jagged. \nCAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is unusual, to say the least: \nA ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets maps and pornography.  The pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) They're all animals anyway. All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. (a beat) Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. \nIt's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and the streets nearly deserted. \nEXT. of TAXI GARAGE.  TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway. \nTRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) Each night when I return the cab to the garage I have to clean the come off the back seat. Some nights I clean off the blood. \nINT. of TAXI GARAGE.  TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small vial of bennies from the glove compartment. \nTRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends inside. \nThe Headquarters of the \"New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee\", located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and blue banners, ribbons and signs. \nOne large sign proclaims \"Palantine\". Another sign reads \"Register for New York Primary, July 20.\". The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians. \nIt is LATE AFTERNOON. \nINSIDE HEADQUARTERS \nA variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones. \nSeen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well- groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut. \nCAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material.  Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order. \nBetsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk: \nBETSY Tom. \nTom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy - yet he keeps trying. \nJust another of those routine office flirtations which pass the hours and free the fantasies. \nBETSY Tom, come here a moment. (he walks over) I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. (a beat) And don't forget to add the new photo releases. \nTOM The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that? \nBETSY Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway. \nTOM I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues. \nBETSY (as if instructing a child) First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man. \nTOM You forgot \"sexy\". \nBETSY No, I didn't forget \"sexy\". \nTOM Just didn't get around to it, huh? \nBETSY Oh, Tom, please. \nTOM Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues. \nBETSY Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings? \nTOM More people watch it. \nBETSY Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, \nTOM No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just... \nBETSY Just what? \nTOM Kidding around... you know, fun. \nBetsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom. \nBETSY Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere. \nTOM With who? \nBETSY Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it. \nBetsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again. \nTOM Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead? \nBETSY That's the last. The finish. Period. Some pople can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious---- \nTOM Sure we could run him. You realize he's already of his block association. \nBETSY (looks across street again) Have you been noticing anything strange? \nTOM No, why? \nBETSY Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us? \nTravis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES to enter without making physical contact - something Travis would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface. \nWizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave. \nWIZARD Travis. \nTRAVIS Hey Wizard. \nTravis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying: \nDOUGH-BOY Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it, \nWIZARD (ironic) Ask Travis. He's the ladies man. \nTravis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee. \nWIZARD (continuing) Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose! \nDOUGH-BOY No. \nTravis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but is. \nWIZARD Yeah. \nDOUGH-BOY Could you see anything? \nWIZARD Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still. \nDOUGH-BOY What did you do? \nWIZARD Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think! (they laugh) What do I have to do? Draw you a picture? \nDOUGH-BOY Yeah. \nWIZARD What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. (to Travis) So howsit? \nTRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio. \nDOUGH-BOY Stick up? \nA WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He asks for a cheeseburger. \nWIZARD Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said \"Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge...\" \nDOUGH-BOY You said that? \nWIZARD Well, I said, \"Lady, please, we're on a bridge...\" \nDOUGH-BOY And what happened? \nTravis awaits Wizard's answer. \nWIZARD She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk. \nDOUGH-BOY A real skunk. \nWizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met. \nWIZARD (paternal) Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie T.? \nCharlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy. \nDOUGH-BOY Yeah. We went to Harvard together. (laughs) \nWIZARD We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey. \nDOUGH-BOY Look who's talking? (gestures around table) Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour? \nTravis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut. \nWIZARD (to Travis) So howsit? \nTRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.  Just heard it on the radio. \nDOUGH-BOY Stick up? \nBetsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.: \nBETSY We've signed up 15.000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering. \nTRAVIS I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, \"One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied\". \nTravis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very sight of it makes one's heart proud. \nBetsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis' contagious, quicksilver moods cause: \nBETSY (laughing) Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. \nTRAVIS I can believe that. \nBETSY Where do you live? \nTRAVIS (evasive) Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much. \nBETSY So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night? \nTRAVIS I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know. \nBETSY After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while. \nTRAVIS Yeah, well... (a beat) In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you. \nBETSY What kind of people? \nTRAVIS Just people people, you know. Just people. (a beat) Had a dead man once. \nBETSY Really? \nTRAVIS He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said \"West 45th Street\" and conked out. \nBETSY What did you do? \nTRAVIS I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him. \nBETSY That's really something. \nTRAVIS Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. \nBETSY The moon? \nTRAVIS The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon. \nBetsy laughs. Travis continues: \nTRAVIS Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you. (a bitterness emerges) It's like you're not even there, not even a person. Nobody knows you. \nBetsy cuts Travis' bitterness short: \nBETSY Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis. \nTRAVIS I know. I could have picked you up. \nBETSY Huh? \nTRAVIS Late one night. About three. At the plaza. \nBETSY Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else. \nTRAVIS No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks. \nBetsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles for a polite rationale for her behavior: \nBETSY You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable. \nTRAVIS If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ. \nBETSY The DMZ? \nTRAVIS South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up. \nBETSY That would have been quite a coincidence. \nThe meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly, \"192 East 89\".  We take off with another jolt. Cross back up 9th Ave, then cut through the park. \nWe're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare. \nNow through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40. \nCheck back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35. \nThe tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take off again with a jolt. \nThis is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these objects? \nEXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street. \nTravis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed. (pause) Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again.  Damn. I've got to remember stuff like that. \nTravis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis' cab. He activates the meter and pulls off. \nMAN'S VOICE St. Regis Hotel. \nTravis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE, candidate for President.  He must have left the Hotel shortly after BETSY. \nTom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks deferentially to Palantine: \nTOM It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins. \nPalantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an earlier conversation. \nASSISTANT I don't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California. \nTravis recognizes his passenger. He puts out his cigarette. \nTRAVIS (interrupting) Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate? \nPALANTINE (only mildly irritated) Yes I am. \nTRAVIS Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you. \nPALANTINE (pleased; glances to check Travis' license) Why, thank you Travis. \nTRAVIS I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. (a beat) I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy. \nPALANTINE (pleasant) I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors. \nTOM (joking) And in some other places too... \nPalantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis: \nPALANTINE Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? \nTRAVIS I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much. \nPALANTINE There must be something... \nTRAVIS (thinks) Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. (MORE) \nTRAVIS (CONT'D) Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess.  Flush it out. \nPalantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning. \nPALANTINE (after a pause) I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. \nTRAVIS (turning the wheel) Damn straight. \nEXT. BARCLAY HOTEL \nTRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel. \nPALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS. \nPALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods goodbye to TRAVIS. \nPALANTINE Nice talking to you, Travis. \nON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage.  Subtitles translate her words. Then, without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed. \nTravis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind: \"What am I doing here?\" \nTRAVIS (to himself) Damn. \nBETSY What's wrong? \nTRAVIS I forgot to get the Coca-Cola. \nThat does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after her. \nHe follows her out of the theatre. \nON THE SIDEWALK \nTravis catches up with her. \nTRAVIS Where are you going? \nBETSY I'm leaving. \nTRAVIS What do you mean? \nBetsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him: \nBETSY These are not the kind of movies I go to. \nTRAVIS Well, I don't follow movies too much... \nBETSY You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to? \nThe TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth. \nTRAVIS This is sort of high class... \nBETSY I mean porno movies. \nTRAVIS (hesitant) Well... mostly... \nBETSY My God! \nTRAVIS We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... \nTravis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees, but is interrupted by Betsy: \nBETSY If you just wanted to fuck, why didn't you just come right out and say it? \nTravis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to move, but words do not come out. \nUnable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where he left off: \nTRAVIS ... there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good. \nBETSY No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home. \nTRAVIS (interrupting) You mean you don't want to go to a movie? (a beat) There's plenty of movies around here. \nBETSY No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all. \nTRAVIS (puzzled) Huh? \nBETSY It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis. \nTRAVIS But... Betsy... \nBETSY I'm getting a taxi. \nShe walks to the curb. \nTRAVIS (following her) What about the record? \nBETSY Keep it. \nTRAVIS Can I call you? \nTravis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door. \nON THE SIDEWALK \nTravis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby POLICEMAN.  Travis quiets down and walks off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \nTravis is again making his way through the garish urban night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging professorial executive. \nC.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless.  The MAN makes himself comfortable in the back seat. \nPROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Jackson Heights. \nTravis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights and coming back with a fare. \nTRAVIS I'm off duty. \nPROFESSIONAL PASSENGER You mean you don't want to go out to Jackson Heights? \nTRAVIS No, I'm off duty. \nPROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Then how come your \"Off Duty\" light wasn't on. \nTRAVIS switches on the \"Off Duty\" light. \nTRAVIS It was on. (gesturing toward top of taxi) it just takes a while to warm up. Like a TV. \nTRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to himself and exits cab. Travis takes off. \nPOV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming out of a East Side movie house. \nLATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid- twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket. \nTRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror. \nYOUNG PASSENGER 471 Central Park West. \nEXT. \nTRAVIS' taxi speeds off. \nLATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of Central Park West. \nTravis checks apartment numbers. \nYOUNG PASSENGER Just pull over to the curb a moment. \nTRAVIS turns the wheel. \nYOUNG PASSENGER Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here. \nTRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away. \nAfter a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks: \nYOUNG PASSENGER Cabbie, ya see that light up there on the seventh floor, three windows from this side of the building? \nCAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) Yeah. \nA young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light. \nYOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) Ya see that woman there? \nTRAVIS (O.S.) Yeah. \nYOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) That's my wife. (a beat) But it ain't my apartment. (a beat) A nigger lives there. (a beat) She left me two weeks ago. It took me this long to find out where she went. (a beat) I'm gonna kill her. \nC.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression. \nYOUNG PASSENGER What do you think of that, cabbie? \nAndy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long eight-inch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize inhuman gun. \nANDY (admiringly) It's a monster. Can stop a car -- put a bullet right into the block. A premium high resale gun. $350 -- that's only a hundred over list. \nEasy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good- looking kid in college who was always making money on one scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets, in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns. \nAndy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's a worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster. \nTravis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand. It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis hands the gun back to Andy. \nANDY I could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today - but I just deal high quality goods to high quality people. (pause) Now this may be a little big for practical use, in which case I'd recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson Special. Fine solid gun - nickel plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver. Now that'll stop anything that moves and it's handy, flexible. (MORE) \nANDY (CONT'D) The Magnum, you know, that's only if you want to splatter it against the wall. The movies have driven up the price of the Magnum anyway. Everybody wants them now. But the Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth every dime of it. (he hefts the .38) Throw in a holster for $10. \nTravis hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window. \nANDY (CONT'D) Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on.  Nothing beats quality. (pause) You interested in an automatic? \nTRAVIS I want a .32.   Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there. \nANDY That's the Colt .25 - a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125. \nTravis holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to side, to see how it rides in his waist. \nTRAVIS How much for everything. \nANDY The .32's $150 - and you're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster. He'll, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal - a good one. \nTRAVIS How much to get a permit to carry? \nANDY Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building. \nTRAVIS Nah, this'll be fine. \nANDY You can't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother? \nTRAVIS Is there a firing range around? \nANDY Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle. \nTravis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills and counts off eight. \nANDY You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket? \nTRAVIS (looking up) Huh? \nANDY Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there. \nTravis hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives Travis a twenty and five. \nTRAVIS Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next. \nANDY (through counting) It's he'll out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. (pockets the money) \nTRAVIS (intensely) They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. (pause) You got anything to carry these in? (gestures to pistols) \nTravis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the current is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of his personality. Travis' inner intensity sets Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers. \nANDY Sure. \nAndy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag. \nANDY You like ball games? \nTRAVIS Huh? \nANDY I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box. \nTRAVIS Nah. I ain't interested. \nAndy closes and locks the suitcases. \nANDY Okay, okay. \nTravis turns to leave. \nTRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE. \nThe GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made up to look older.  She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes. Her face is pallid.  She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses and multi-colored leg stockings. \nHer name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS. \nTRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror. \nIRIS Come on, mister, let's get outta here -- quick. \nTRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens. \nIRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see. \nSPORT (to IRIS) Come on, baby, let's go.  This is all a real drag. \nIRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab.  The rear door closes. \nSport leans partially in the front window, throwing something on the front seat.  TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill. \nSPORT Just forget all about this, cabbie. It's nothing. \nTRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely, but notices he is wearing a jacket.  The voice is that of a man in his early twenties. \nTRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off with Iris. \nTRAVIS shrugs and turns around. \nTRAVIS' taxi pulls away. \nCUT TO: \nEARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m.  Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into TAXI GARAGE. \nINT. GARAGE \nTRAVIS pulls into his stall. \nTRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment.  He looks to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there, untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously. \nTRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab.  He gathers up his time report and heads toward book-in table. \nA SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage.  His hands are in his jacket pockets, obscuring the slight bulge on his left side. \nTRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER.  He reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls out crumpled $20 bill.  Seeing the $20 bill, he decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead. \nTRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened theater auditorium.  A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly behind the concessions counter. \nINT. PORNO THEATER AUDITORIUM \nTRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the reflected light from the screen. \nFEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.) Oh, come on, now, down, lick it, come on... (a beat) Mmm, that's good.  Ahh, ahh, more ... \nTRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too graphic.  Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes, TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his field of vision by small degrees. \nMOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice over. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) The idea had been growing in my brain ... \nCUT TO: \nTRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.  CAMERA MOVES slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps, pictures.  We now see their contents clearly: \nThe wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles, leaflets, bumper stickers.  As the CAMERA MOVES along it discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut- up sections of city maps with notations written in.  There is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased Secret Security Protection during the primaries.  A section pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined.  Further along there is a sheet reading \"traveling schedule\" and a calendar for June with finely written notations written over the dates. \nTRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) ... for some time.  True Force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again. \nAs the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS, standing, his shirt open, but the mattress.  He is wearing the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand. \nIn the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson in gunmanship: \nTRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his holster and firing it. \nHe hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices withdrawing it.  He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length, tightening his forearm muscles. \nSEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible. \nWhatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's -- ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads.  As in most porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the CAMERA to receive instructions.  Studio grunts, groans and moans of pleasure have been dubbed in. \nAction on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching afternoon soap opera.  He is cleaning his .38 and eating from a jar of applesauce.  Soap opera audio continues. \nHe watches the soap opera without expression. \nSOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap opera. \nA YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap opera voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had tried to terminate their \"relationship.\" \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital room.  Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip stamp catalogue. \nSOAP OPERA BOY Is it that she just doesn't -- like me? \nSOAP OPERA GIRL (hesitantly) Well, Jim, it's just that -- I don't know how to say this -- it's that she thinks your parents aren't... good enough, I guess. \nTRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with the television set. \nHe places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate which supports the TV.  Then, slowly rocking his heel back and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without knocking it over. \nThe TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama, rocks back and forth. \nTRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the portable TV crashing to the floor. \nThere is a short flash and the TV screen turns white. \nTRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and tries to reactivate the vanished image.  TRAVIS' efforts are futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to life. \nTRAVIS (to himself) Damn, damn. \nTRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his hands, despairing of himself. \nFADE TO: \nAbout 1 a.m.  TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie hangout on Park Avenue South. \nHe locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis.  He sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore. \nA LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE.  He pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and walks toward the wall-length counter. \nAn assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped table near the rear of the cafeteria.  Some are barely awake, some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and smalltalk. \nWizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated at a long table. \nWIZARD You know Eddie, he's the new hippie kid in our group, long hair... \nWizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod. \nWIZARD ...he called up the Dispatcher last night.  Charlie McCall, our dispatcher... \nDOUGH-BOY One-Ball McCall? \nWIZARD That's the guy.  Eddie calls him up and says, \"Hey, what do you want me to do.  I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare.  She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do? \nThe cabbies laugh.  Across the cafeteria Travis selects a cup of coffee and some pastries. \nCHARLIE T This is on the two-way with about a hundred and fifty cars listenin in. \nWIZARD McCall says. \"How much on the meter?\"  Eddie comes back and says \"Two-fifty.\" McCall says, \"Is she worth it\". \nMore laughter. \nDOUGH-BOY Fuckin One-Ball. \nWIZARD And the kid says, \"Yeah.  She's about 19, good-lookin.\"  McCall says, \"What can I tell you?\" \nFOURTH CABBIE She should have told him to get an OK from the front office. (laughter) \nTRAVIS Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me... \nWIZARD Yeah? \nTRAVIS I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long. \nWIZARD Shoot.  They don't call me the Wizard for nothing. \nTRAVIS Well, I just, you know... \nWIZARD Things got ya down? \nTRAVIS Real down. \nWIZARD It happens. \nTRAVIS Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  I get some real crazy ideas, you know?  Just go out and do somethin. \nWIZARD The taxi life, you mean. \nTRAVIS Yeah. \nWIZARD (nods) I know. \nTRAVIS Like do anything, you know. \nWIZARD Travis, look, I dig it.  Let me explain.  You choose a certain way of life.  You live it.  It becomes what you are.  I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab.  I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am. \nA police car stops across the street.  TWO PATROLMEN get out and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway. \nWIZARD (continuing) Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it.  It becomes what he is.  Why fight it? What do you know?  How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in. \nTRAVIS (pause) That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard. \nWIZARD What do you expect, Bertrand Russell?  I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? (a beat) I don't even know what you're talking about. \nTRAVIS Neither do I, I guess. \nWIZARD You fit in.  It's lonely, it's rough at first.  But you fit in. You got no choice. \nWIZARD Yeah.  Sorry, Wizard. \nWIZARD Don't worry, Killer.  You'll be all right. (a beat) I seen enough to know. \nTRAVIS Thanks. \nWIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, \"Chin up, old boy,\" and walks around to the driver's side of his cab. \nWIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural inhabitants. \nCUT TO: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY \nA rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting. \nA CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the rally to begin.  Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the loudspeaker system. \nThe CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques, stands out in the CROWD. \nOn the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS. \nTOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER. \nTOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to what he was reading.  Then he returns his gaze to the upper left, watching something very closely. \nAfter a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is standing. \nTOM Betsy, come over here a moment. \nBETSY What is it?  I'm busy. \nTOM (insistent) Just follow me. \nTRAVIS But that one night? \nIRIS I was stoned.  That's why they stopped me.  When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go.  They just protect me from myself. \nThere is a pause.  TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically. TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette.  It's burning down to the butt. \nTRAVIS Well, I tried. \nIRIS (compassionate) I understand, mister.  It means something, really. \nTRAVIS (getting up) Can I see you again? \nIRIS That's not hard to do. \nTRAVIS No, I mean really.  This is nothing for a person to do. \nIRIS Sure.  All right.  We'll have breakfast.  I get up about one o'clock.  Tomorrow. \nTRAVIS (thinking) Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a... \nIRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule. \nIRIS Well, you want to or not? \nTRAVIS (deciding) O.K. It's a date.  I'll see you here, then. \nTRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles. \nTOM Oh, Iris? \nIRIS Yes? \nTOM My name's Travis. \nIRIS Thank you, Travis. \nTRAVIS So long, Iris. (a beat) Sweet Iris. (smiles) \nTRAVIS exits. \nTRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor for a moment. \nThe OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand.  OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS, and checks his watch. \nOLD MAN (holding gun) I think this is yours, cowboy. \nTRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar crumpled $20 bill.  He makes a big show of stuffing the wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand.  The OLD MAN doesn't understand the significance of it. \nTRAVIS (restrained anger) Here's the twenty bucks, old man. You better damn well spend it right. \nTRAVIS turns and walks away. \nOLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs: \nOLD MAN Come back anytime you want, cowboy. But without the rod -- please. \nTRAVIS does not respond. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ST. REGIS SUITE NOON \nPalantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in garishly decorated suite. \nASSISTANT Well, at least it wasn't chicken. \nPALANTINE It wasn't?  I thought it was.  It tasted like chicken. \nTOM C'mon, Senator.  That was a class dinner.  The St. Regis is a class joint.  That was veal. \nPALANTINE Was it?  It sure tasted like chicken to me. (a beat) Lately, everything tastes like chicken to me. \nASSISTANT Everything?  Got to watch your gut. \nPALANTINE What about it?  I took 20 off before we started this thing. \nIRIS He never killed nobody.  He's a Libra. \nTRAVIS Huh? \nIRIS I'm a Libra too.  That's why we get along so well. \nTRAVIS He looks like a killer. \nIRIS I think Cancer's make the best lovers.  My whole family are air signs. \nTRAVIS He shoots dope too. \nIRIS What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror.  You don't get eyes like that from... \nTRAVIS He's worse than an animal.  Jail's too good for scum like that. \nThere is a brief silence.  Iris mind continued to whirl at 78 rpms.  She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a time.  She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself. \nIRIS Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think.  Before that it was fantastic.  I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore.  Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know?  It was unbelievable.  Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane--that's my group, man. All Libras.  But now everybody's split or got sick or busted.  I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went.  I stayed here. \nTRAVIS I never been to a commune.  I don't know.  I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. \nIRIS Why don't you come to a commune with me? \nTRAVIS Me?  I could never go to a place like that. \nIRIS Why not? \nTRAVIS (hesitant) I... I don't get along with people like that. \nIRIS You a scorpion?  That's it.  You're a scorpion.  I can tell. \nTRAVIS Besides, I've got to stay here. \nIRIS Why? \nTRAVIS I've got something important to do. I can't leave. \nIRIS What's so important? \nTRAVIS I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time. \nIRIS You a narc? \nTRAVIS Do I look like a narc? \nIRIS Yeah. \nTRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins his laughter. \nIRIS God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me. \nTRAVIS (pause) What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard? \nIRIS Just leave'em.  There's plenty of other girls. \nTRAVIS You just gonna leave 'em? \nIRIS (astonished) What should I do?  Call the cops? \nTRAVIS Cops don't do nothin. \nIRIS Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. \nTRAVIS You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls.  You should get rid of them. \nIRIS How? \nTRAVIS (shrugs) I don't know.  Just should, though. (a beat) Somebody should kill 'em.  Nobody'd miss 'em. \nIRIS (taken back) God.  I know where they should have a commune for you.  They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. \nTRAVIS (apologetic/sheepish) I'm sorry, Iris.  I didn't mean that. \nIRIS You're not much with girls, are you? \nCUT TO: \nLENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's nightlife as TRAVIS sees it.  CAMERA TRACKS down midtown sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.  There we see: \nCOUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middle- aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends, boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night. \nOthers would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTD) Loneliness has followed me all my life.  The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks.  There is no escape.  I am God's lonely man. \nMATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT. Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. \nThe CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker.  A JUNKIE shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can, a STREET-WALKER meets a prospective CLIENT. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTINUED) I am not a fool.  I will no longer fool myself.  I will no longer let myself fall apart, become a joke and object of ridicule.  I know there is no longer any hope.  I cannot continue this hollow, empty fight.  I must sleep.  What hope is there for me? \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT \nTRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table. \nC.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table.  We read it. \nDear Iris, This money should be enough for your trip.  By the time you read this I will be dead. \nTravis \nTRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope. \nTIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER.  TRAVIS has cleaned up his apartment.  Everything is neat and orderly. \nCAMERA PANS across room.  The mattress is bare and flattened out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight.  The wall is still covered with Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25. \nTRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the middle of his clean room.  The empty holster hangs on his shoulder.  Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in his right sleeve.  He turns toward table. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and walks down the corridor. \nHe passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is empty--and trashed.  Travis lives in a decaying, if not condemned building. \nEXT. \nTRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box. \nBACK IN APARTMENT.  CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the table in neat array. \nCUT TO: \nFADE IN: \nSOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band playing, talking. \nAFTERNOON.  A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall.  A DIXIELAND BAND is playing on the platform. \nC.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine. There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD. \nPALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform. Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr. \nSLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally. At this distance, the rally sounds are almost indistinguishable. \nC.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking.  They make their way past one person, then two, then a cluster of three or four.  SOUNDS of rally increase. \nWe see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in an opening near the fringes of the CROWD. \nTRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive. His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses.  His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed and drawn tight.  He looks from side to side. One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail. \nEven though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom. Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper torso to look larger than it should.  He is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets. \nAnyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon TRAVIS and think, \"There is an assassin.\" \nINTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS' apartment. \nNIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave.  He speeds, honks, accelerates quickly.  The glare of speeding yellow and red lights flash through the night. \nTRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS' taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything. \nINTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway.  He waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back. \nTRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against the curb. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT stands.  CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS. \nWithout slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness. \nTRAVIS Hey, Sport.  How are things? \nSPORT (shrugs) O.K., cowboy. \nTRAVIS (needling him) How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport? \nSPORT What's going on? \nTRAVIS I'm here to see Iris. \nSPORT Iris? \nTRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the corridor. \nSPORT Wha -- ? \nTRAVIS Yeah, Iris.  You know anybody by that name? \nSPORT No. (beat) Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble. \nTRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control. \nTRAVIS (restrained anger) You carry a gun? \nSPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes the seriousness of the situation. \nTRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing him even further back against the wall. \nTRAVIS Get it. \nSPORT (submissive) Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here.  This don't make any sense. \nTRAVIS (demanding) Show it to me. \nSPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a \"purse gun\") from his pocket and holds it limply. \nTRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it. There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain. \nTRAVIS Now suck on that. \nAgony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor. TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits. \nAs TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the b.g. \nTRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the sidewalk. \nAROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway leading to IRIS' apartment. \nAs he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left hand.  He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each hand. \nAT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting at the far end of the dark corridor.  THE OLD MAN starts to get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him.  BLAAM! The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder. \nTHE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right hand has been blown off at the forearm. \nThere is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his face grimaces in pain.  A bullet has ripped through the left side of his neck.  Blood flows over his left shoulder. \nTRAVIS' .44 flies into the air. \nTRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in a puddle of his own blood.  He has struggled long enough to fire one shot. \n-- down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickle- plated .38 Smith and Wesson Special \n-- to the foot of the stairs where SPORT's body is hunched over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand \n-- to CROWDS huddled around the doorway, held back by POLICE OFFICERS \n-- past red flashing lights, running POLICEMEN and parked police cars \n-- to the ongoing nightlife of the Lower East Side, curious but basically unconcerned, looking then heading its own way. \nFADE TO: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT - DAY \nIt is EARLY FALL.  The trees are losing their leaves. \nCUT TO: \nSLOW TRACKING SHOT across INT. APARTMENT.  Room appears pretty much the same, although there is a new portable TV and an inexpensive easy chair. \nVISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to the mattress. \nWe see these items: \n-- On the table rests the diary, closed.  A desk calendar stands on the table: it is October. \n-- Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung there are now a series of new newspaper clippings.  Right to left, they read: \n1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News. Headline reads: \"CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS.\" There are large photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter, and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot. \n2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo from the N.Y. Times.  Two-column headline reads: \"Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead.\" \n3. A follow-up story from the News.  Two-column photo shows plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room. Two-column headline reads: \"Parents Express Shock, Gratitude.\" \n4. A two-column Daily News story without photo.  Headline reads: \"Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover.\" \n5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure page.  Headline reads: \"Cabbie Returns to Job.\" \n-- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the wall.  It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white paper.  The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and orderly.  We recognize that it is the same letter that is being read in voice over. \n-- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is barren.  A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at the head of the mattress. \nAUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle- aged uneducated man reading in voice over. \nIt is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall. \nIRIS' FATHER (V.O.) Dear Mr. Bickle, \nI can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to hear that you are well and recuperating.  We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma. \nThere is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us.  We thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again.  Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household. \nI'm sure you want to know about Iris.  She is back in school and working hard.  The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again. \nIn conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would.  But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home. \nOur deepest thanks, \nBurt and Ivy Steensma \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT \nFour cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel. \nNear the entrance, TRAVIS and WIZARD stand in the light talking. \nTRAVIS' hair is almost fully grown back to its normal length. TRAVIS wears the same clothes -- cowboy boots, jeans, western shirt, Army jacket -- but he isn't wearing a gun. There is a thick scar on the left side of his neck. \nWizard is speaking. \nWIZARD A private-owner wanted to swap wheels.  Now my tires were brand new. \"Give me a couple days,\" I says. \n", "test1_input": "TOM I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose. \nBETSY No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can. \nTOM Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos... \nBETSY He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when - \nTOM Is he Italian? \nBETSY No, why? \nTOM You sure he's not Italian? \nBETSY He's Black, OK? \nTOM Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something. \nBETSY As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them. \nTOM Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic. \nBETSY Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary? \nTOM I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief. \nBETSY First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. \nTOM With the other hand, right? \nBETSY No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point. \nTOM I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at - \nBETSY No, this is young - well, I'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure. \nTOM Show me how he did that again. \nEXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS \nTravis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the Palantine Headquarters. \nHe s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in. \nWatching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive. His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes he is cursed, and therefore he is. \nTravis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's desk.  Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis ignores him. \nTRAVIS (at Betsy's desk) I want to volunteer. \nAs the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet. \nTOM (at Betsy's desk) If you'll come this way. \nTravis elbows Tom off. \nTRAVIS (to Betsy) No. I want to volunteer to you. \nTOM (under his voice) Bets. \nBETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating everything is OK.  He walks away. \nBETSY (curious) And why is that? \nTRAVIS is on his best behavior.  He smiles slightly: \nTRAVIS Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. \nBETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS' presence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star qualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her. And then, too, there is that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would say, \"fascinating\". \nBETSY (smiling) Is that so? (pause) But what do you think of Charles Palantine? \nTRAVIS (his mind elsewhere) Who mam? \nBETSY Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president. \n", "test1_true": "BETSY You want to canvass? \nTRAVIS Yes, mam. \nBetsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way: \nBETSY How do you feel about Senator Palantine's stand on welfare? \nThis takes TRAVIS back a bit.  He obviously doesn't have the slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever. TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer: \nTRAVIS Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change. \nBetsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by Travis. \nBETSY Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging. \nTRAVIS I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker. \nBETSY (gesturing) if you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something. \nTRAVIS If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you. \nBETSY Well, we're all working tonight. \nTRAVIS Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night. \nBETSY Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? \nTRAVIS (bolstering courage) If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me. \nBetsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws closer to the flame. \nBETSY Why? \nTRAVIS Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. (smiles) \nTravis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows. It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself.  Betsy is completely disarmed. \nBETSY I don't know... \nTRAVIS It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you. \nBETSY (smiles) All right. (relents) All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie. \nTRAVIS Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly. (pause) And... ah... Betsy... \nBETSY Yes? \nTRAVIS My name is Travis. \nBETSY Thank you, Travis. \nTravis nods, turns and exits. \nTom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo- standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was doing. \nBetsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and says: \nBETSY I'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking. \nCUT TO: \nTravis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway... \nINT. COFFEE SHOP \nTravis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands. \nAs Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese.  I think that was a good selection. Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish. She could have had anything she wanted. \n", "test2_input": "LOWER EAST SIDE.  TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts across toward Tompkins Square. \nTRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth. \nHe has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the street.  She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window.  C.U. GIRL's face. \nTRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi a week or so before.  IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns and continues walking. \nTRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND.  They are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots, jeans, floppy hats.  And the old come-hither walk is unmistakable. \nTRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk down the sidewalk. \nTRAVIS' P.O.V.  He examines them from bottom to top -- boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats. \nAs TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows.  The GIRLS look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some unheard comment, and continue on. \nIRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on. \nOn the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat out of place in this environment, but making every attempt to groove on it.  They are high on something or another. \nThe GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them. They exchange some small talk and walk off together.  There is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up. \nTRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS. This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy. \nAs TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND.  She walks over to the taxi, loans in the open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised as an innocent question: \nC.U. HIPPIE HOOKER. \nHIPPIE HOOKER Hey cabbie!  You comin' or goin'? \nTRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock, embarrassment and revulsion.  He is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar.  The very presence of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him. \nTRAVIS takes off with a skreetch.  His taxi shoots down the block. \nCUT TO: \nA HOT JUNE DAY.  TRAVIS' taxi, the \"Off Duty\" sign on, is parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM.  WHITE COPS, SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g. \nCHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system.  It is a political rally. \nTRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in the distance.  His hair, of course, is still clipped short and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses.  Even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38 Smith and Wesson bulge. \nA BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters.  On the platform sit an array of BLACK DIGNITARIES.  Nearby we recognize the SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD anxiously. \nPALANTINE is speaking animatedly.  He is an excellent speaker and captures our attention.  He drives hard toward his arguments, crashes down on his points.  His strained voice rings with sincerity and anger. \nC.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks.  He is dressed in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face. \nPALANTINE The time has come to put an end to the things that divide us: racism, poverty, way -- and to those persons who seek to divide us. Never have I seen such a group of high officials from the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet members... \nCUT TO TRAVIS: no expression.  PALANTINE's words are barely distinguishable from a block away: \nPALANTINE (in distance) ... pit black against white, young against old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion -- and all in the name of the \"good of the country.\" Well, their game is over. (applause) All their games are over.  Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda and demagoguery.  Now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive.  Is unity and love of common good such a lost thing? \nALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins.  He is reading from a letter or card he has just written. \nAs he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and so forth.  These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the narration. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (reading) Dear Father and Mother, June is the month, I remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday.  I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of all of them. I'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year, but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy.  I know you will understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of money.  I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her. (MORE) \nTRAVIS (V.O.; CONT'D) Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that. (interrupted) \nAs TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window. \nThe POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration. LIVE SOUND RESUMES. \nPOLICEMAN (standing near window) Hey, cabbie, you can't park here. \nTRAVIS (penitent) Sorry, officer. \nPOLICEMAN You waiting for a fare? \nPOLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab.  As he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of his jacket, ready to draw his revolver. \nTRAVIS No, officer. \n", "test2_true": "TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off. \nLIVE SOUND again CEASES as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as taxi drives away. \nAs TRAVIS reads final paragraph, scene CUTS TO INT. APARTMENT where TRAVIS sits at his table. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (resuming reading) I hope this card finds you all well, as it does me.  I hope no one has died.  Don't worry about me. One day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me. \nLove, Travis. \nTRAVIS, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has just written this letter. \nC.U. cover of card.  It is a 25\u00a2 Wedding Anniversary card with a four-color embossed cover.  The design could only be described as ur-kitsch.  A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast.  Sentiment reads: \nHAPPY ANNIVERSARY To a Couple Who Have Found the Perfect Combination For Marriage... \nThe card opens to read: \nLOVE! \nUnderneath the word \"Love!\" begins TRAVIS' short message to his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of the card. \nCUT TO: \nNIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE.  TRAVIS sits parked in the dark shadows of a side street.  The lone wolf waits. \nTRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers. \nTRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced. \nA BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from TRAVIS.  He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at the sidewalk in front of him.  Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: \"That-cock-sucking-crazy-no- good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her- nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass...\" and so on.  He is Out of Control.  Nobody seems to notice or care. \nTRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake- out. \nFinally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND.  Iris wears her large blue sunglasses. \nTRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens the door and exits from the cab. \nFlipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches over and walks toward IRIS.  He sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious when he's trying to appear innocent. \nTRAVIS (shy) Hello. \nIRIS You looking for some action? \nTRAVIS Well...I guess so. \nIRIS (eyeing him) All right. (a beat) You see that guy over there? (nods) His name is Sport.  Go talk to him. I'll wait here. \nTravis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket.  Travis walks toward him. \nSport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp.  His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping. He sings to him self, \"Going to the chapel, gonna get married...\" His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal.  He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged runaway. \nTRAVIS You name Sport? \nSport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop.  He extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed. \nSPORT Here, officer, take me in.  I'm clean.  I didn't do it.  Got a ticket once in Jersey.  That's all. Honest, officer. \nTRAVIS Your name Sport? \nSPORT Anything you say, officer. \nTRAVIS I'm no cop. (looks back at Iris) I want some action. \nSPORT I saw.  $20 fifteen minutes.  $30 half hour. \nTRAVIS Shit. \nSPORT Take it or leave it. \nTRAVIS digs in his pocket for money. \nSPORT No, not me.  There'll be an elderly gent to take the bread. \n", "test3_input": "TRAVIS turns to walk away. \nSPORT Catch you later, Copper. \nTRAVIS freezes, not saying anything.  He turns back toward SPORT. \nTRAVIS I'm no cop. \nSPORT Well, if you are, it's entrapment already. \nTRAVIS I'm hip. \nSPORT Funny, you don't look hip. (laughs) \nTRAVIS walks back to IRIS. \nIRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does. \nIRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block, saying nothing.  IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and TRAVIS follows her. \nAt the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly lit hallway.  On either side are doors with apartment numbers.  IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2. \nIRIS This is my room. \nAt the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN. His face is obscured by shadow.  TRAVIS is about to enter the room when the OLD MAN speaks up: \nOLD MAN Hey cowboy! \nTRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up and is advancing toward him. \nOLD MAN (motioning to TRAVIS' jacket) The rod. (a beat) Gimme the rod, cowboy. \nTRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do.  The OLD MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special. \nOLD MAN This ain't Dodge City, cowboy.  You don't need no piece. (glances at watch) I'm keepin' time. \nTRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS. \nTRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room is brightly decorated.  There is an orange shag carpet, deep brown walls and an old red velvet sofa.  On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda.  A Neil Young album is playing on a small phonograph. \nThis is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a young girl. \nIRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it in an ashtray on the bedstand. \nTRAVIS Why you hang around with them greasers? \nIRIS A girl needs protection. \nTRAVIS Yeah.  From the likes of them. \nIRIS (shrugs) It's your time mister.  Fifteen minutes ain't long. (gestures to cigarette) That cigarette burns out, your time is up. \nIRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and coat.  She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last defense.  Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks like a little girl she is.  About 14, 15. \nTRAVIS What's your name? \nIRIS Easy. \nTRAVIS That ain't much of a name. \nIRIS It's easy to remember.  Easy Lay. \nTRAVIS What's your real name? \nIRIS I don't like my real name. \nTRAVIS (insistent) What's your real name? \nIRIS Iris. \nTRAVIS That's a nice name. \nIRIS That's what you think. \nIRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind. TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity. \n", "test3_true": "IRIS buttons only the bottom button of her shirt. \nIRIS (examining him) Why?  Who are you? \nTRAVIS I drive a taxi.  You tried to get away one night.  Remember? \nIRIS No. \nTRAVIS You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you. \nIRIS I don't remember. \nTRAVIS It don't matter.  I'm gonna get you outta here. (looks toward door) \nIRIS We better make it, or Sport'll get mad.  How do you want to make it? \nTRAVIS (pressured) I don't want to make it.  I came here to get you out. \nIRIS You want to make it like this? (goes for his fly) \nTRAVIS pushes her hand away.  He sits beside her on the edge of the bed. \nTRAVIS (taking her by the shoulders) Can't you listen to me?  Don't you want to get out of here? \nIRIS Why should I want to get out of here?  This is where I live. \nTRAVIS (exasperated) But you're the one that wanted to get away.  You're the one that came into my cab. \nIRIS I musta been stoned. \nTRAVIS Do they drug you? \nIRIS (reproving) Oh, come off it, man. \nIRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly.  This only unnerves TRAVIS more: sexual contact is something he's never really confronted. \nTRAVIS Listen... \nIRIS Don't you want to make it? (a beat) Can't you make it? \nIRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA.  He bats her hand away. \nTRAVIS (distraught) I want to help you. \nTRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to overcome it. \nIRIS (catching on) You can't make it, can you? (a beat) I can help you. \nIRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS.  TRAVIS, seeing this, jumps up in panic. \nTRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS.  His fly is still open, and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans. He is starting to come apart. \nTRAVIS Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it! \nIRIS (confused) You can do it in my mouth. \nTRAVIS Don't you understand anything? \nIRIS says nothing.  After a moment, TRAVIS again sits on the bed beside IRIS.  She no longer tries to make him. \nThere is a moment of silence.  IRIS puts her arm around his shoulder. \nIRIS You don't have to make it, mister. \nTRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself.  Finally, he says: \nTRAVIS (slowly) Do you understand why I came here? \nIRIS I think so.  I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away. \nTRAVIS Don't you want to go? \nIRIS I can leave anytime I want. \n"}

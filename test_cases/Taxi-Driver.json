{"test1_input": "TOM I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose. \nBETSY No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can. \nTOM Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos... \nBETSY He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when - \nTOM Is he Italian? \nBETSY No, why? \nTOM You sure he's not Italian? \nBETSY He's Black, OK? \nTOM Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something. \nBETSY As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them. \nTOM Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic. \nBETSY Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary? \nTOM I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief. \nBETSY First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. \nTOM With the other hand, right? \nBETSY No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point. \nTOM I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at - \nBETSY No, this is young - well, I'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure. \nTOM Show me how he did that again. \nEXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS \nTravis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the Palantine Headquarters. \nHe s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in. \nWatching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive. His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes he is cursed, and therefore he is. \nTravis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's desk.  Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis ignores him. \nTRAVIS (at Betsy's desk) I want to volunteer. \nAs the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet. \nTOM (at Betsy's desk) If you'll come this way. \nTravis elbows Tom off. \nTRAVIS (to Betsy) No. I want to volunteer to you. \nTOM (under his voice) Bets. \nBETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating everything is OK.  He walks away. \nBETSY (curious) And why is that? \nTRAVIS is on his best behavior.  He smiles slightly: \nTRAVIS Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. \nBETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS' presence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star qualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her. And then, too, there is that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would say, \"fascinating\". \nBETSY (smiling) Is that so? (pause) But what do you think of Charles Palantine? \nTRAVIS (his mind elsewhere) Who mam? \nBETSY Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president. \n", "test1_true": "BETSY You want to canvass? \nTRAVIS Yes, mam. \nBetsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way: \nBETSY How do you feel about Senator Palantine's stand on welfare? \nThis takes TRAVIS back a bit.  He obviously doesn't have the slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever. TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer: \nTRAVIS Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change. \nBetsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by Travis. \nBETSY Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging. \nTRAVIS I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker. \nBETSY (gesturing) if you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something. \nTRAVIS If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you. \nBETSY Well, we're all working tonight. \nTRAVIS Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night. \nBETSY Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? \nTRAVIS (bolstering courage) If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me. \nBetsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws closer to the flame. \nBETSY Why? \nTRAVIS Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. (smiles) \nTravis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows. It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself.  Betsy is completely disarmed. \nBETSY I don't know... \nTRAVIS It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you. \nBETSY (smiles) All right. (relents) All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie. \nTRAVIS Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly. (pause) And... ah... Betsy... \nBETSY Yes? \nTRAVIS My name is Travis. \nBETSY Thank you, Travis. \nTravis nods, turns and exits. \nTom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo- standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was doing. \nBetsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and says: \nBETSY I'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking. \nCUT TO: \nTravis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway... \nINT. COFFEE SHOP \nTravis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands. \nAs Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese.  I think that was a good selection. Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish. She could have had anything she wanted. \n", "test1_id": 2835, "test2_input": "SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible. \nWhatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's -- ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads.  As in most porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the CAMERA to receive instructions.  Studio grunts, groans and moans of pleasure have been dubbed in. \nAction on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching afternoon soap opera.  He is cleaning his .38 and eating from a jar of applesauce.  Soap opera audio continues. \nHe watches the soap opera without expression. \nSOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap opera. \nA YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap opera voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had tried to terminate their \"relationship.\" \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital room.  Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip stamp catalogue. \nSOAP OPERA BOY Is it that she just doesn't -- like me? \nSOAP OPERA GIRL (hesitantly) Well, Jim, it's just that -- I don't know how to say this -- it's that she thinks your parents aren't... good enough, I guess. \nTRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with the television set. \nHe places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate which supports the TV.  Then, slowly rocking his heel back and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without knocking it over. \nThe TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama, rocks back and forth. \nTRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the portable TV crashing to the floor. \nThere is a short flash and the TV screen turns white. \nTRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and tries to reactivate the vanished image.  TRAVIS' efforts are futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to life. \nTRAVIS (to himself) Damn, damn. \nTRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his hands, despairing of himself. \nFADE TO: \nAbout 1 a.m.  TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie hangout on Park Avenue South. \nHe locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis.  He sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore. \nA LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE.  He pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and walks toward the wall-length counter. \nAn assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped table near the rear of the cafeteria.  Some are barely awake, some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and smalltalk. \nWizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated at a long table. \nWIZARD You know Eddie, he's the new hippie kid in our group, long hair... \nWizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod. \nWIZARD ...he called up the Dispatcher last night.  Charlie McCall, our dispatcher... \nDOUGH-BOY One-Ball McCall? \nWIZARD That's the guy.  Eddie calls him up and says, \"Hey, what do you want me to do.  I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare.  She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do? \nThe cabbies laugh.  Across the cafeteria Travis selects a cup of coffee and some pastries. \nCHARLIE T This is on the two-way with about a hundred and fifty cars listenin in. \nWIZARD McCall says. \"How much on the meter?\"  Eddie comes back and says \"Two-fifty.\" McCall says, \"Is she worth it\". \nMore laughter. \nDOUGH-BOY Fuckin One-Ball. \nWIZARD And the kid says, \"Yeah.  She's about 19, good-lookin.\"  McCall says, \"What can I tell you?\" \nFOURTH CABBIE She should have told him to get an OK from the front office. (laughter) \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE T Yeah.  About a hundred and fifty. \nDOUGH-BOY I hope he had a checker. \nWIZARD She was just a kid.  Stoned, you know. \nTravis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to their table.  Charlie T spots him. \nCHARLIE T Hiya Killer. \nCharlie forms his hand into a pistol, cocks and fires, making the SOUND, \"Pgghew.\"  TRAVIS nods. \nWIZARD You're getting a rep, Travis. \nTRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their conversation. \nCHARLIE T Got the five you owe me, Killer? \nTRAVIS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of small denomination bills.  The crumpled $20 bill falls onto the table.  TRAVIS stares at it a moment.  He unfolds a five, gives it to CHARLIE T, then picks up the crumpled $20 and puts it back into his jacket pocket. \nWIZARD (O.S.) (to Travis) What's the action around? \nTRAVIS Slow. \nCHARLIE T Shit yes.  Night woulda been dead if I hadn't grabbed an outatowner at Kennedy.  Took him roun the horn and got a five dollar tip to boot. \nWIZARD (joking) One of these days we're gonna turn you in, Charlie T.  Fleecin the hicks like that. \nDOUGH-BOY Remember the time this cat picks up four dudes from the other side, Pakastanis I think they were, holds up their passports, to the toll booth collector on the bridge and charges em ten bucks each for 'crossing the border? \nThey all laugh. \nCHARLIE T Hell, I know'd you to do worse. \nDOUGH-BOY Least I'm no airport rat.  I work the whole town. \nCHARLIE T (chuckling) It's a living. \nWIZARD gets up to leave. \nWIZARD Well, I'm shovin' on. \nWIZARD gets up, nods and walks toward the CASHIER.  After a second's thought, TRAVIS calls to him: \nTRAVIS Hey Wiz, just a second.  I wanna talk to you. \nWIZARD waits for TRAVIS as he takes a final gulp of coffee and catches up with him.  CHARLIE T calls to TRAVIS as they go: \nCHARLIE T See ya, Killer.  Don't forget your pea shooter. \nCHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again, fires and chuckles. \nWIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye, pay the CASHIER and exit. \nEXT. \nTRAVIS follows WIZARD out onto the sidewalk.  TRAVIS follows WIZARD as he walks toward his cab.  He has something on his mind, something he wants to talk to WIZARD about. \nTRAVIS (walking) Hey Wiz. \nWIZARD leans back against the cab.  TRAVIS is about to speak when he spots a GROUP of BLACK and PUERTO RICAN STREET PUNKS, ages 12-15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him.  ONE tosses a spray paint can around his back, basketball style. ANOTHER mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of the cabs. \nWIZARD has no visible reaction.  A flash of controlled anger crosses TRAVIS' face.  He stares at the BOY with the poised key.  It is the same look that crossed his face in the Harlem Deli.  We are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just beneath TRAVIS' surface. \nThe BLACK PUNK must instinctively realize this too, because he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD. \nThe YOUNG MEAN-STREETERS continue down the street and TRAVIS turns back to WIZARD. \nAcross the street, in the background, a JUNKIE nestles in a doorway. \nTRAVIS (hesitant) Wiz? \nWIZARD Yeah? \n", "test2_id": 2836, "test3_input": "CUT TO: \nLENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's nightlife as TRAVIS sees it.  CAMERA TRACKS down midtown sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.  There we see: \nCOUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middle- aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends, boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night. \nOthers would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTD) Loneliness has followed me all my life.  The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks.  There is no escape.  I am God's lonely man. \nMATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT. Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. \nThe CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker.  A JUNKIE shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can, a STREET-WALKER meets a prospective CLIENT. \nTRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTINUED) I am not a fool.  I will no longer fool myself.  I will no longer let myself fall apart, become a joke and object of ridicule.  I know there is no longer any hope.  I cannot continue this hollow, empty fight.  I must sleep.  What hope is there for me? \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT \nTRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table. \nC.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table.  We read it. \nDear Iris, This money should be enough for your trip.  By the time you read this I will be dead. \nTravis \nTRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope. \nTIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER.  TRAVIS has cleaned up his apartment.  Everything is neat and orderly. \nCAMERA PANS across room.  The mattress is bare and flattened out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight.  The wall is still covered with Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25. \nTRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the middle of his clean room.  The empty holster hangs on his shoulder.  Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in his right sleeve.  He turns toward table. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and walks down the corridor. \nHe passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is empty--and trashed.  Travis lives in a decaying, if not condemned building. \nEXT. \nTRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box. \nBACK IN APARTMENT.  CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the table in neat array. \nCUT TO: \nFADE IN: \nSOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band playing, talking. \nAFTERNOON.  A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall.  A DIXIELAND BAND is playing on the platform. \nC.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine. There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD. \nPALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform. Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr. \nSLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform. \nCUT TO: \nTRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally. At this distance, the rally sounds are almost indistinguishable. \nC.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking.  They make their way past one person, then two, then a cluster of three or four.  SOUNDS of rally increase. \nWe see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in an opening near the fringes of the CROWD. \nTRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive. His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses.  His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed and drawn tight.  He looks from side to side. One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail. \nEven though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom. Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper torso to look larger than it should.  He is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets. \nAnyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon TRAVIS and think, \"There is an assassin.\" \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nSECRET SERVICE MAN standing beside the platform, scanning the CROWD.  It is the same SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the first rally.  TOM, dressed in a conservative suit, stands beside him. \nPALANTINE is wrapping up his short speech: \nPALANTINE ... and with your help we will go on to victry at the polls Tuesday. (applause) \nTRAVIS begins moving up into the crowd. \nPALANTINE (CONTD) On to victory in Miami Beach next month (building applause) and on to victory next November! \nPALANTINE steps back, smiling and receiving the applause. Then, nodding, at the SECRET SERVICE MAN he descends the stairs and prepares to work his way through the CROWD. \nTRAVIS unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket, opening access to his holster.  With the other hand he checks the .44 hooked behind his back. \nPALANTINE smiles and shakes a few of the many hands outstretched toward him. \nThe SECRET SERVICE MAN, scanning the CROWD, spots something that interests him.  He looks closely. \nSECRET SERVICE MAN'S P.O.V.: TRAVIS, his face intense, pushes his way through the CROWD. \nPALANTINE works his way through crowds and cameras. \nSECRET SERVICE MAN motions to SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN and points in TRAVIS' direction. \nTRAVIS slips his hand into his jacket. \nThe SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN converges on TRAVIS from the side. \nTRAVIS and PALANTINE draw closer to each other. \nSECRET SERVICE MAN, walking just behind PALANTINE, grabs the candidate's hand and pulls him backward.  PALANTINE looks sharply back at SECRET SERVICE MAN who motions for him to take a slightly altered route. \nTRAVIS sees this: his eyes meet the SECRET SERVICE MAN's. He recognizes the situation.  To his right he spots the SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN. \nTRAVIS' eyes meet PALANTINE's: candidate and would-be assassin exchange quick glances. \nTRAVIS hastily works his way back through the CROWD.  He hears the SECRET SERVICE MAN's voice call out: \nSECRET SERVICE MAN Detain that man! \nOVERHEAD SHOT reveals TRAVIS has the jump on his pursuers. He is breaking free of the CROWD while they are still mired in it. \nTRAVIS, free of his pursuers, quickly makes his way down the sidewalks.  The SECRET SERVICE MEN look futilely about. \nTRAVIS jumps in his cab.  Sweat covers his face. \nCUT TO: \nThe film is moving fast now; it pushes hard and straight toward its conclusion.  We're moving toward the kill. \nLATE AFTERNOON.  TRAVIS' taxi skids around a corner and speeds into Manhattan. \nTRAVIS checks his mail slot: the letter to IRIS has already been picked up by the MAILMAN. \nTRAVIS, stripped to the waist, walks back and forth across his INT. APARTMENT, wiping his torso with a bath towel. \nTRAVIS begins dressing: \n-- He straps the Army combat knife to his calf. \n-- He reflexes the metal gliders and the Colt .25 on his right forearm. \nINTERCUT: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER EAST SIDE shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS.  It is EARLY EVENING. \nINTERCUT: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to SPORT.  The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and exchange a soul shake.  They discuss a little private business and the PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of IRIS' apartment. \n-- TRAVIS straps on holster and fits the .38 Special into it. \nINTERCUT: PRIVATE COP walks down block. \n-- TRAVIS hooks the huge Magnum into the back of his belt. He puts on his Army jacket and walks out the door. \n", "test3_id": 2837}

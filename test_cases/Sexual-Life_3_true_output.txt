JOANNE That's my job. 
The phone rings. 
GWEN The machine can get it. 
JOANNE I don't monitor calls.  It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my own home. 
BEEP.  From the answering machine-- 
VOICE Gwen, this is David Warren.  Hopefully, a welcome voice from your past.  My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend. I'd love to catch up.  Are you free for coffee...or something? 
JOANNE Pick up the phone. 
Gwen just stares at the machine. 
VOICE I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you. 
CLICK. GWEN Wow. 
JOANNE How long has it been? 
GWEN College. 
JOANNE Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never miss it. 
GWEN If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it. 
JOANNE Hmm.  It's Kismet, then. 
GWEN What? 
JOANNE A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with your anger. 
GWEN You're insane.  You're an insane mother. 
JOANNE It'll be good for your self-esteem. 
GWEN Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee? 
Joanne crosses to the answering machine.  Rewinds the tape. Hits play. 
DAVID'S VOICE ...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for coffee...or something? 
She hits stop. 
JOANNE "Coffee...or something."  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or something. 
GWEN He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue! 
Joanne gathers her purse. 
JOANNE You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.  But take a tip from someone who's been there.  Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.  You have a chance to level the playing field. 
(beat) 
You have a chance to do something good for your marriage. 
Joanne exits.

INT. GWEN'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Morning.  Gwen, fresh from the shower, studies her face in the mirror as Josh -- unseen, in the bedroom -- dresses for work. 
JOSH You're right.  We could use some more color in the living room. 
(beat) 
Gwen? 
GWEN Yes? 
JOSH I said you're right. 
GWEN About what? 
JOSH About more color in the living room. 
GWEN Oh.  I'm glad you think so. 
She leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle.

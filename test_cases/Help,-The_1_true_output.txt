EXT. RURAL BUS STOP - LATER THAT MORNING 
Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road. 
MINNY (V.O.) Number Three: When you're cooking white food, taste it with a different spoon. They see you put the tasting spoon back in the pot, might as well throw it all out. Spoon, too. 
EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - LATER 
Minny approaches the Foote estate. She stops just short of stairs leading up to the front porch. 
MINNY (V.O.) Four: You use the same cup, same fork, same plate every day. Minny takes her first step on the stairs. 
MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Five: Don't hit her kids. White people do they own spanking. Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door. 
MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Six: No sass-mouthing! Minny knocks. 
MINNY (CONT'D) 
(TO HERSELF) Number six, Minny. Number six. The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in tight pink clothes. Flour covers her face and hair. 
CELIA Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote. Aibileen said you'd be on time. Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet. 
CELIA (CONT'D) Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola? 
MINNY No, thank you. I'm Minny Jackson... You...cooking something? 
CELIA One of those upsidedown cakes from the magazine. It ain't workin' out too good. Come on in. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Minny enters behind Celia gawking at the flour massacre. 
MINNY What in the hell- Minny catches herself. 
MINNY (CONT'D) 
(TO HERSELF) Tuck it in, Minny. Tuck it in. 
CELIA I guess I have some learnin' to do. 
MINNY 
(STUPID SMILE) You sure do. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room. Minny gawks at a dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs. 
CELIA Johnny's momma wouldn't let me decorate a thing. If I had my way, this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff. Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete with bullet holes. 
MINNY Where you from? Celia lowers her head in shame... 
CELIA Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis. 
MINNY I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live there. Celia changes the subject. 
CELIA Let's go meet Oscar! Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away. 
INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Minny stands at the base of a massive, stuffed Grizzly bear. It clears the twelve-foot ceiling by an inch. 
CELIA Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in Montana back in 1910 with Teddy Roosevelt. Celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind Oscar. 
CELIA (CONT'D) We got five bedrooms and bathrooms here in the main house. The pool house has two more beds and baths. 
MINNY When you gone have some chillins, start fillin' up all these beds? Celia swallows hard. She places her hand on her stomach. 
CELIA I'm pregnant now. Minny steps back and surveys Celia. 
MINNY Gone be eatin' for two. Double the cookin'. Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house. 
CELIA I know it's an awful lot to do. Five other maids have already turned me down...Can I at least give you some bus money? 
MINNY When you hear me say I don't wanna clean this house? 
CELIA What? So...You'll do it?! Before Minny can nod. Celia throws her arms around her. Minny backs away. 
MINNY No huggin', now. No huggin'. 
CELIA I'm sorry. This is my first time hiring a maid. 
MINNY We got to talk about some things first. I work Sunday through Friday. Celia bites her pinky nail. 
CELIA You can't come at all on weekends.

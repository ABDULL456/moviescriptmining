{"test1_input": "FATHER JANOVICH Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn't remember the last time you went. \nWALT Is that so? \nFATHER JANOVICH It is. Walt drains his lowball glass. \nWALT Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary. \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 9 \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - LATER \nPeople are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks. Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home. The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER ANGLE Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window. \nMITCH I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless. Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance. \nWALT Fine. Go. \nMITCH I'll call in a few, see how you're doing. Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off. \nWALT Kill you to buy American. \nINT. LAND CRUISER - SAME TIME \nMITCH Did you see him look at the truck? It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 10 \nKAREN At least he didn't say anything this time. \nMITCH He didn't have to. \nKAREN Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years. \nMITCH And I suppose that's my goddamned fault? \nBACK ON WALT \nWalt gets his guests' engine running. As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes. The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard. The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder. It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to Daisy. \nWALT Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians. \nINT. HMONG HOUSE NEXT DOOR - SAME TIME \nThe house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak their native language, the younger generation speaks both English and Hmong. (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.) Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry. Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household. It's not our way. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 11 \nMAN \n(SUBTITLED) What about Tao? \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) What about him? \nMAN \n(SUBTITLED) He's the man in the house. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Tao's not a man. \n(GESTURES) Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman. Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys. The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink, without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an insult. In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong \u0093Soul Calling\u0094 ceremony starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is present and begins the ritual. As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips on his coat and goes out the back door. \n", "test1_true": "Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow. Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye contact as Tao passes. Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy. \nWALT I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his age. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT \nTao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 12 A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when -- WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the snow. A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand around the stunned, prone Tao. \nHEAD LATINO Whatta you gonna do, gook? You gonna \u0091Kung Fu' us? Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike. \nLATINO #2 Surprised it ain't a girl's bike. The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground. \nHEAD LATINO You gonna get up or what? Tao doesn't move. \nHEAD LATINO Tell you what, I'll let you take the first swing. You drop me and you can have your bike back. Tao smiles, he can't help it. \nHEAD LATINO What the fuck you smiling at, gook? Something funny? He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet. \nHEAD LATINO You better get the fuck outta here, bitch. He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow. This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos. The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike. \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - SUNNY SPRING MORNING \nSUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 13 Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses. Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown. Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed a chicken coop. Walt looks down at Daisy -- \nWALT Damn chinks let their yards go to hell. Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass. \nWALT I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block. This used to be a nice neighborhood. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nTao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move? He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here. All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away. Look at him strut like a rooster. She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black. \nINT. WALT'S HOUSE - DAY \nDaisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell rings; Daisy doesn't even move. Walt walks to the front door holding a roll of duct tape. The doorbell rings again. Walt looks down at Daisy -- \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 14 \nWALT Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf? Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is Father Janovich. \nFATHER JANOVICH Hi there, Walt. \nWALT Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt? \nFATHER JANOVICH Sorry... Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT So, what are you peddling now? \nFATHER JANOVICH Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. Haven't seen you in church in awhile. \nWALT Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT I don't think so, kid. Sorry. \nFATHER JANOVICH Why? Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT You don't want to know. \n", "test1_id": 2394, "test2_input": "The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and Sue exchange looks out on the front step. Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin, they're cocky. \nSPIDER Hey, cuz. What's up? \nTAO What are you doing here? \nSPIDER Be happy. We've got good news. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 27 \nSUE Oh really? What's that? \nSMOKIE We're giving you another shot. \nTAO I don't think so. \nSMOKIE You blew it the first time. We've got another little inauguration planned for you. This time there'll be no mistakes. \nSUE Another big, tough gangbanger with \u0091little-man' complex. Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable. \nSMOKIE I got my eye on you too, little girl. \nSUE Whatever. \nSMOKIE Come on, Tao. Let's go. Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground. \nSPIDER He said, let's go. \nSMOKIE Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get hurt. We'll take care of you. \nSUE Don't go, Tao. \nSMOKIE You mind your own business, girl. Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms. The front door swings open and there stands a glaring Phong. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Leave my grandson alone! \nCONTINUED: \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 28 I know what you are. Go away and don't come back. \nSMOKIE That old woman's got bigger balls than you. You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you? Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt. \nSMOKIE I'm not gonna say it again. Let's go. Now. Tao is shoved towards the car. Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks free. \nSUE Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the ground. \nSUE \nRUN!! Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's mother comes out the front door. Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay. A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel. Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes a pushing, rolling, surging melee. This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard. \nEXT. WALT'S YARD - SAME TIME \nThe gangbangers, Tao, his mother, grandmother and Sue all struggle on Walt's painstakingly maintained lawn. A ceramic Lawn Gnome is knocked over and breaks. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPHONG (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 29 And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face. \nWALT Get off my lawn. \nSMOKIE Listen, old man, you don't want... \nWALT I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers. The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds. \nSMOKIE Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your house, old man. \nWALT Get off my lawn. \n", "test2_true": "WALT Don't think for a second I won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if I shot a deer. Now get off my goddamned lawn. Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground. \nWALT Believe me, kid, I'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby. I couldn't care less. \nSMOKIE I'm not gonna warn you again! Walt laughs... \nWALT You're nothing to me. In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 30 Complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the neighborhood. All eyes are on Walt. Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle. Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but melt back towards their car. As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something. \nSMOKIE You better watch yourself, old man. The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street. Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front yard. A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up... \nSUE Thank you. Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground. \nWALT I said get off my lawn. \nINT. WALT'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING \nWe hear a sound outside. Walt grabs his rifle, swings open the front door and leads with the barrel. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WALT'S FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME \nWalt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle. His front porch is covered with FLOWERS and FRUIT and GIFTS of food. There must be a dozen different gifts piled there. Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before putting her nose in a food basket. \nWALT Bad dog. Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPAGE 31 \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - DAY \nWalt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash. He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the Hmongs. His garbage is overflowing. Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables. Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop. \nWALT No. No more. The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn around. \nNEXT DOOR Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all speaking in his ear at the same time. Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her. Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his house. Tao looks like a whipped dog. \nWALT Why won't these people leave me alone? Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands, indicating they've come far enough. Sue holds up a plant. \nSUE We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden. \nWALT I don't want them. \nSUE They're perennials, they come back every year. \nWALT No. You keep them. Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage? Sue is a little taken aback. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 32 \nSUE Because... because you saved Tao. \nWALT No, I didn't. All I did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn. \nSUE Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood. \nWALT No, I'm not. \nSUE Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're bringing you the gifts. \nWALT Just take your plant and leave me alone. Walt turns and starts to walk away. Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue. They look at Tao and then to Walt. \nSUE There's another thing. \nWALT What? \nSUE This is my mother, Vu, I'm Sue and this is my brother, Tao. We live next door. \nWALT So? \nSUE Tao is here to apologize. Sue shoots a hard look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably. \n", "test2_id": 2395, "test3_input": "(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 96 \nSUE Look at you smile, old man. Kicking back, having a good old time. You're sure pleased with yourself today. \nTAO And it's a little unnerving if you ask me. \nWALT Aw, go on. \nSUE No, admit it. You are. You're feeling pretty good, aren't you? \nWALT Well, who wouldn't? I'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day. Great food, good friends. Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once. \nTAO It never ends. \nWALT I'm just kidding. Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum. If Tao doesn't ask you out soon, I will. \nSUE Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's a white devil. \nWA XAM \n(LAUGHS) I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it. \nWALT I'll be damned. Movie? Dinner? Wa Xam and Tao nod. They're a bit embarrassed. \nSUE Yeah, they're taking the bus. \nWALT The bus?! That's no good. A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 97 \nTAO Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO. \nTAO The Gran Torino? You'd let me drive it? \nWALT Sure. Why not. \nTAO Really? Walt smiles. \nWALT Really. They shake hands. \nINT. WALT'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWalt watches baseball. He hears a car outside. Shouts are heard and glass breaks. Walt gets up and looks out the shades... TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN! Windows shatter and the siding splinters. FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nWalt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds. Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to Tao -- making sure no one's been hit. \nWALT Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his neck. He's stunned. \nWALT Oh no. Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt. Walt probes around Tao's neck. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 98 \nTAO What... what is it? \nWALT Hang on... you're just cut, is all. \nTAO Is everybody else okay? \nWALT Yeah. Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao follows his gaze. \nTAO It's a miracle no one was killed. \nWALT They aimed high. Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls. \nWALT Where's Sue? \nTAO She went to our aunt's. \nWALT Call her. \n", "test3_true": "WALT I said call her. Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there. Tao scrambles for the phone and dials. Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head \u0093no.\u0094 For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking about. There is anguish on every face in the room. \nCUT TO: \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 99 \nINT. TAO'S HOUSE - LATER \nWalt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor. Walt speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who shoots him dirty looks. \nWALT This is exactly what I didn't want. Damn gooks. Why the hell am I even here? \nTAO Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans. Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to Tao. \nWALT In Korea I learned not to care. The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea. You harden yourself. Don't let anything get to you. Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over and swings open the door. Everyone expects the worst... And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are dirty and torn. BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt. Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand. Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her mother and sobs. Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao. Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark. \nEXT./INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nWalt staggers across the yard to his house. \nWALT No, no, no, no, no. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 100 Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder. It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself. He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs his old dog as he bawls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALT'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nWalt sits, red-eyed. He's done crying. Family photo albums are scattered around. Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door. \nFATHER JANOVICH Mr. Kowalski, are you in here? \nWALT Come on in. Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt. \nFATHER JANOVICH Are you okay? Walt nods. \nFATHER JANOVICH The police finally left. No one is talking. One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut. \nWALT I've noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies. \nWALT You know, there's no way that Tao or Sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys don't go away. Go away forever. You know it as well as I do. \nFATHER JANOVICH What are you saying? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 101 \nWALT You heard what I said. \nFATHER JANOVICH They took Sue to the hospital. She's scared. They're all scared. \nWALT I'm not. \nFATHER JANOVICH I know that. Believe me, they all know that. Tao especially. He's sitting out there staring at your front door. You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT Yeah, well what would you do if you were me? If you were Tao? What would you do? Father Janovich shakes his head. \nFATHER JANOVICH I know what I'd do if I was you, or at least what you think you should do. If I was Tao I guess I'd want vengeance. I'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys. \nWALT And you? \nFATHER JANOVICH What would I do? I'd come over here and talk to you I guess. I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski. Walt nods. \nWALT Wanna beer? \nFATHER JANOVICH I'd love one. \nWALT They're in the cooler, grab me one too. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test3_id": 2396}

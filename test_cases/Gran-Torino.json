{"train": "GRAN TORINO \nWritten by \nNick Schenk \nFADE IN: \nINT. CHURCH \nWe're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored teenagers. WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit. \nOLDER MAN I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach. \nWALT Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953. Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring. \nWALT Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews. \nMITCH Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral? \nSTEVE What do you expect? Dad's still living in the \u009150s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly. \nMITCH Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad appreciates that. \nSTEVE My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 3 It's inevitable. That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something. \nMITCH What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood? \nSTEVE Why don't you have him move in with you? \nMITCH Ha ha. \nINT. CHURCH - LATER \nThe choir sings the Beatitudes. Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish. FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife. Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich. \nFATHER JANOVICH Death... is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased ... and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call life? \nWALT Jesus. Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white cloth. \nCONTINUED: \nINT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nThe house is crammed with people following the service. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to keep busy. Steve steps over to his father. \nSTEVE A lot of people showed up after the service. \nWALT Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham. I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs. \nSTEVE I'll do it, Dad. \nWALT Naw, we need them now, not next week. \nINT. CELLAR - SAME TIME \nGrandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed through. \nJosh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground. \nDAVID Is that Dad? \nDANIEL No, it's Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo over and reads it... \nJOSH \u0091Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.' \nDANIEL Where's Korea? \nJOSH Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 5 \nDAVID Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs. \nFATHER JANOVICH No, I do. \nWALT The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 15 Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTao walks down the street, his head in a book. He finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly behind him. The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the Chevy. It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy easily keeps up with Tao. \nLATINO DRIVER Is you a boy or a girl, I can't tell? \nLATINO #2 What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking. \nLATINO DRIVER That's right, you keep walking. Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man. Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood? Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers. The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at Tao. \nSPIDER Dude, that's my little cousin, Tao. \nSMOKIE You sure about that, Spider? \nSPIDER I'm sure. Do we do something... or what? Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second. \nSMOKIE Your cousin tight with anyone? \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 16 \nSPIDER No, he flies solo, Smokie. \nSMOKIE Okay. Let's go help out our little cousin. Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and the Latinos' car. \nSMOKIE You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born. \nLATINO DRIVER Oh goody, more Rice Niggers. The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL. A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned. \nLATINO #2 Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go back to your fucking rice paddy. The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves. Tao simply keeps walking down the street! \nSMOKIE Where the fuck does he think he's going? Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours. They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks. \nSPIDER Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going? You should really think about hanging with us, man. If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks. Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer. \nSPIDER You can't be such a little girl. You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 17 Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat. Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group of Latino gangbanger types. \nSMOKIE You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - DAY \nTao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits and reads JANE magazine on the porch. The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up. Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out. \nSPIDER Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue. \nSUE What do you want? \nSPIDER Came to talk to my cousin Tao. Smokie looks over to Sue. \nSMOKIE Spider, who's the other cousin? SUE laughs at the name \u0093Spider.\u0094 Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red highlights. \nSUE \u0091Spider'? Is that what he just called you, Fong? \nSPIDER This is my little cousin, Sue. Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue. \nSMOKIE Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl? \nSUE Mentally, I'm way too old for you. I'm going inside. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 21 \nFATHER JANOVICH Ummmm... I'll have a gin and tonic. \nWALT Attaboy. The waitress leaves. \nWALT So, what do you want? \nFATHER JANOVICH I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession. \nWALT Jesus Christ, why'd you do that? \nFATHER JANOVICH She was very insistent. She made me. \nWALT You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on. \nFATHER JANOVICH Let's talk about something else. \nWALT Like what? \nFATHER JANOVICH Life and death. \nWALT What would you know about it? \nFATHER JANOVICH I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest. \nWALT You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook. \nFATHER JANOVICH I don't know about that... \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 22 Walt waves his hand and cuts him off. \nWALT \u0091Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death? Good God, it's pathetic. \nFATHER JANOVICH What do you know, Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT Plenty. I lived with death for three years in Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake. I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with. \nFATHER JANOVICH And what about life? Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his answer. \nWALT Well... I survived the war... got married... and raised a family. \nFATHER JANOVICH Sounds like you know more about death than you do living. Walt downs a shot. \nWALT Maybe so. \nINT. WALT'S BEDROOM - THAT SAME NIGHT \nWalt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he had plenty to drink at the VFW. \nWALT Daisy? The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am. Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 23 \nWALT Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea. Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud SNAP. \nINT. GARAGE - SECONDS LATER \nThe light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE. Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud metallic clang. Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs up, Walt advances, step for step. Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip. They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth. As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer sign on the wall. Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night. Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage. \nWALT Shit. \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME \nTao scrambles down the alley. Parked off to the side is Spider's Honda. Spider opens the door. \nSPIDER Get in, get in! Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger get out. \nCONTINUED: \nThe tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and Sue exchange looks out on the front step. Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin, they're cocky. \nSPIDER Hey, cuz. What's up? \nTAO What are you doing here? \nSPIDER Be happy. We've got good news. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 27 \nSUE Oh really? What's that? \nSMOKIE We're giving you another shot. \nTAO I don't think so. \nSMOKIE You blew it the first time. We've got another little inauguration planned for you. This time there'll be no mistakes. \nSUE Another big, tough gangbanger with \u0091little-man' complex. Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable. \nSMOKIE I got my eye on you too, little girl. \nSUE Whatever. \nSMOKIE Come on, Tao. Let's go. Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground. \nSPIDER He said, let's go. \nSMOKIE Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get hurt. We'll take care of you. \nSUE Don't go, Tao. \nSMOKIE You mind your own business, girl. Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms. The front door swings open and there stands a glaring Phong. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Leave my grandson alone! \nCONTINUED: \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 28 I know what you are. Go away and don't come back. \nSMOKIE That old woman's got bigger balls than you. You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you? Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt. \nSMOKIE I'm not gonna say it again. Let's go. Now. Tao is shoved towards the car. Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks free. \nSUE Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the ground. \nSUE \nRUN!! Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's mother comes out the front door. Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay. A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel. Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes a pushing, rolling, surging melee. This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard. \nEXT. WALT'S YARD - SAME TIME \nThe gangbangers, Tao, his mother, grandmother and Sue all struggle on Walt's painstakingly maintained lawn. A ceramic Lawn Gnome is knocked over and breaks. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPHONG (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 29 And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face. \nWALT Get off my lawn. \nSMOKIE Listen, old man, you don't want... \nWALT I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers. The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds. \nSMOKIE Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your house, old man. \nWALT Get off my lawn. \nTAO I'm sorry. \nWALT For what? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 33 \nTAO For trying to steal your car. Walt's eyes go wide in recognition. He turns white with rage. \nWALT Get this straight, I see you on my property again, you're done. Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house. \nINT. WALT'S ENTRYWAY \nThe doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father Janovich standing on his front step. \nFATHER JANOVICH Good afternoon, Walt. Walt's eyes narrow. \nFATHER JANOVICH I mean, Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT I already told you I'm not going to confession. \nFATHER JANOVICH Why didn't you just call the police? \nWALT Pardon? \nFATHER JANOVICH I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police? \nWALT Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what? No answer. \nFATHER JANOVICH What were you thinking? Someone could have been killed. We're talking life and death here. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 34 \nWALT Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react. In Korea, we never \u0091called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines. We reacted. \nFATHER JANOVICH We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski. Walt says nothing. \nFATHER JANOVICH I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that won't leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You're right, those are things I don't know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness. And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost. \nWALT I'm impressed. You came with your guns loaded, for once. \nFATHER JANOVICH Thank you. \nWALT You have balls, Father. And what you said, you're right. I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation. Hallelujah. But there's one thing you're way wrong about. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 35 \nFATHER JANOVICH What's that, Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do. \nINT. OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP \nThe old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair. \nBARBER There, you look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard. \nWALT I'm just amazed that you're still alive. I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you. \nBARBER That'll be ten dollars, Walt. \nWALT Ten dollars? Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price. You sure you're not part Jew? Martin the Barber laughs at Walt. \nBARBER It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch. \nWALT Here's ten, keep the change. \nBARBER See you in three weeks, you prick. \nWALT If you live that long, dipshit. Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out. \nTALL BLACK GUY You are fucking crazy. \nWALT You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back. The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them down. \nWALT But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out. All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a rock. Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground. \nTALL BLACK GUY Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it. The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green light. Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's... \nTREY Man, thanks a lot, mister. Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his arm. Walt looks at Trey's outfit. \nWALT Go home, clown... and pull up your goddamned pants. Walt turns to Sue. \nWALT Come on, I'll give you a ride. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nPAGE 40 \nINT. WALT'S TRUCK - DRIVING \nWalt and Sue drive in silence. Finally Sue speaks up. \nSUE So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something? \nWALT What in the hell's the matter with you? I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart. What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood? That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river. \nSUE I know, I know. Take it easy. Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at all. They drive. \nWALT So, that goofball back there. He's your boyfriend? \nSUE Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey. \nWALT Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that. Why don't you date one of your... own...one of those other... Hu-mungs. \nSUE You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not Hu-mung. \nWALT Right. Hmong. What is a... where is Hmong or whatever? Sue laughs. \nSUE Wow! You're so enlightened. Hmong isn't a place, it's a people. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 41 Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China. \nWALT Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead of back there? \nSUE It's a Vietnam thing. We fought on your side and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we came over here. Walt is quiet for few seconds. \nWALT Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake? There's snow on the ground near half the year. Jungle people on the frozen tundra? \nSUE Hill people. We were hill people, not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga. \nWALT Whatever. \nSUE Blame the Lutherans. They brought us here. \nWALT Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away. Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism. \nSUE Thanks for the ride. \nWALT Sure... You know, you seem okay. What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother? He a little slow or something? \nCONTINUED: \nSUE (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 42 \nSUE Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn't know which direction to go in. \nWALT Oh, poor Toad. \nSUE It's really common. Hmong girls over here fit in better, we adjust. The girls go to college, the boys go to jail. \nEXT. WALT'S FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING \nWalt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. He flips from section to section. Daisy's at his feet. Next door, Phong sits watching Walt. He can see her mumbling under her breath. \nSUE Are you okay? Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME \nEPIPHANY. Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands. He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror. Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953. \nWALT (to himself) Son of a bitch. I've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSUE (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 52 Walt looks at himself. \nWALT Happy birthday. Walt opens the bathroom door. Sue stands there with a concerned look on her face. \nSUE Are you okay? \nWALT Me? I'm fine. \nSUE You were bleeding? Walt smiles disarmingly. \nWALT I just bit my tongue. I'm fine. I'm great. Let's get some of that gook food, I'm starving. \nINT. KITCHEN \nWalt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's obviously never tasted before. Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong ladies. Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt. \nSUE Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs. \nWALT Why? \nSUE To mingle. \nWALT I'm fine right here. I'm mingling. \nSUE Come on, you said \u0091not to leave you alone.' \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 53 \nINT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME \nWalt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of his element down with all the Hmong teenagers. And the first person he sees across the room is Tao. \nWALT Oh great. \nSUE Well, look who's over there. \nWALT What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino. \nSUE My brother Tao. \nWALT Yeah, Toad. Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles. Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine. He just can't help it. All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the headlights. \nWALT It was wobbly, but I fixed it. It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore. The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with their hands. Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink. \nWALT What's this? \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 54 \nSUE Rice liquor. Try it. \nWALT Alright. Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls. One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her, but then looks away. The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair. Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do. They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao. Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to Walt. She smiles -- \nWA XAM (GIRL) My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here? \nWALT Good question. What am I doing here? Anyways, I'm Walt. \nWA XAM Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam. \nWALT Wa Yum? \nWA XAM No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do? \nWALT Me? Not too much... I fix stuff I guess. \nWALT No. Forget it. Stop bringing me stuff. Gee scolds Walt in Hmong. \nWALT No. I've had it. Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil. Walt looks at the food. \nCONTINUED: (4) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 58 \nWALT I can't. You have to stop. Gee pulls the tinfoil off. Walt gazes at the food. \nWALT Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day? \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - EVENING \nWalt pulls up in his pickup truck. Sue and Vu wait on Walt's porch. Tao stands out on the sidewalk. Walt gets out of his pickup. \nWALT What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He looks at Sue for the translation. \nSUE Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you. \nWALT No he's not. \nSUE Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt. He'll start tomorrow morning. \nWALT No. The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property. I thought we already went over that. \nSUE It's very important to my mother that you accept. It'd be an insult to refuse. \nWALT How is this all of a sudden turned around on me? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I'm the bad guy if I don't accept? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 59 \nSUE My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you don't let Tao repay... Tao interrupts from the sidewalk... \nTAO Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want to, let's just go. Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English, Vu in Hmong. \nSUE/VU Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!! Tao looks at the ground. A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women's faces. Their expression \u0093begs\u0094 Walt. Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales loudly... \nWALT Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them and into his house. \nWALT Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers. \nEXT. WALT'S PORCH - NEXT MORNING \nWalt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Tao walks sheepishly over to the property line. \nWALT Son of a bitch, I didn't think he'd show. Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt. \nWALT Okay. What are you good at? \nTAO Like what? \nWALT That's what I'm asking. What are you good at? \nCONTINUED: \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 60 If you're gonna work for me, I have to know what you can do. \nTAO I don't know. \nWALT That's about what I expected. Okay, why don't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder. \nTAO Count the birds? \nWALT Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right? \nTAO Yes, I can count. \nEXT. WALT'S GARDEN - MORNING \nTao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence. Walt doesn't even look at Tao. Finally... \nGRANDSON Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch? Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad. \nWALT I don't see why not. \n(GRINS ) Tell him sometime after lunch. \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - MORNING \nTao walks up the sidewalk. Before ringing the doorbell, Tao looks down at his hands which have several CALLOUSES on them. Tao rubs his hands with a smile. This has been the first time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him. Tao reaches for the doorbell... \nINT. WALT'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME \nWalt stands over the sink, coughing. In the b.g. the doorbell rings. Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with fibers. The doorbell rings again. Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink. \nINT. WALT'S ENTRYWAY - SECONDS LATER \nWalt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a third time. Walt looks angry. \nWALT Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off. \nTAO It's my last day, whatta you want me to do? \nWALT Take the day off, you've done enough. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 64 Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing. He nods and starts to walk away. Walt calls after him... \nWALT Toad. Tao turns around. Walt wants to say something, but stops. \nWALT Nothing, never mind. Walt shuts the door. \nINT. DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM \nWalt sits in the crowded waiting room. He looks around. He's the only WHITE PERSON in the room. Even most of the STAFF is African or from India. As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez, Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla. Finally when the name \u0093Kowalski\u0094 is called, the Muslim woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nWalt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap. A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a chart. \nASIAN DOCTOR Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT That's right. \nASIAN DOCTOR Good afternoon. I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests. I feel that this... \nWALT Wait a minute. Where's my regular doctor, where's Dr. Fellman? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 65 \nASIAN DOCTOR Dr. Fellman retired three years ago. I'm his replacement, Dr. Chang. \nWALT Jesus Christ. \nINT. MITCH'S KITCHEN \nMitch, Karen and Ashley are in the kitchen. The phone rings and Ashley looks at the caller ID. \nASHLEY It's Grandpa Walt. \nKAREN Well, pick it up. \nASHLEY You talk to him. \nKAREN Mitch? \nMITCH I'm doing bills here. \nKAREN He's your father. Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button. \nMITCH Hello, Dad. \nWALT (V.O.) Hello? It's me... Dad. \nMITCH I know. What's up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed. \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 69 \nINT. TAO'S KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER \nTao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink. \nWALT For the love of Pete. \nTAO What? \nWALT It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head. \nINT. WALT'S GARAGE \nThe CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao looks at all of Walt's tools. \nTAO Man, where did you get all this stuff? \nWALT What are you talking about? \nTAO All the tools and stuff. \nWALT Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned. \nTAO Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here. \nWALT You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 70 \nTAO Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool. \nWALT Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression. \nWALT Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up -- \nWALT What? \nTAO I can't afford to buy all this stuff. \nWALT I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools. \nTAO Yeah, but... \nWALT Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession. \nWALT This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 71 \nTAO Okay. Cool. Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see the spot of BLOOD in his hand. \nTAO What's with that? \nWALT What's with what? \nTAO The blood you just coughed up. That's not good, you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub. \nWALT So... what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night? Who are they? \nTAO A gang. Hmong gangbangers. \nWALT I gathered that. What did they want with you? \nTAO They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation. \nWALT You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that? \nTAO I don't know. They were persuasive. My cousin's in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess. \nWALT Well, at least you're honest about it. A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMITCH Why don't you call Stevie? \nWALT Your brother lives out of state. \nMITCH Well, I don't know what to tell you, I'm on my way out. Keys in my hand. \nWALT Okay then. \nMITCH If you can't find anyone by next week, give me a call. Walt nods and hangs up. Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 75 \nMITCH Aunt Mary. Like she needs a freezer. \nINT. TAO'S HOUSE \nThe doorbell rings and Tao opens the door. There stands Walt. Tao is a little shocked. \nWALT You got a minute, Toad? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALT'S BASEMENT - A MINUTE LATER \nWalt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly. \nWALT I just need a little push. All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step. \nTAO Let me take the top. \nWALT Naw, I got it. \nTAO No really, I'll take the top. It looks pretty heavy. \nWALT I'm not crippled. I got it. \nTAO If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping. I'll go home. \nWALT Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and... \nTAO You listen, old man. You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it's top or I'm out of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin. \nCONTINUED: (3) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 76 \nWALT Okay then, be my guest. Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me. Tao laughs. \nTAO Don't give me any ideas. \nEXT. WALT'S BACKYARD - MINUTES LATER \nTao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break. They both breathe hard. \nTAO That thing weighs a ton. \nWALT Yeah, but it runs like new. They don't make them like that anymore. \nTAO What are you going to do with it? \nWALT Sell it. I haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there. \nTAO How much? \nWALT Oh, I don't know. Sixty bucks, maybe. Why, you need a freezer? \nTAO \n(NODS) Our downstairs one died. Walt thinks for a second. \nWALT Twenty-five and it's yours. \nTAO Twenty-five? You just said sixty? \nWALT Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper. \nTAO You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work. \nWALT Is that why I see you out in your garden all the time? Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong. \nTAO Funny. Walt lights a cigarette. \nTAO You should quit those. It's bad for you. \nWALT So is joining a gang, you dipshit. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSUE (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 80 \nTAO Seriously, you should quit, I saw you cough up blood. \nWALT So, you ever think about what you want to do with your life? \nTAO I don't know. \nWALT You've never thought about it? \nTAO Of course I have. \nWALT Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit. Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's chives. \nTAO Sorry. \nWALT Put some mulch around the cucumbers. Tao spreads more mulch. \nTAO I was thinking about sales, maybe. \nWALT My oldest son's a salesman. He sells cars. \nTAO Does he do well? \nWALT License to steal. I worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars. \nTAO You made cars? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 81 \nWALT That's right. And I put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in \nTAO Wow, that's cool. \nWALT It is, isn't it? \nTAO Does your son come over much? \nWALT How are you going about getting into sales? You thinking about school? \nTAO Kinda. \nWALT Well, you should. \nTAO School costs money. \nWALT Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden. \nTAO Maybe you could just pay me. \nWALT That's funny. \nTAO What kind of job could I get? \nWALT Good question. Who the hell would hire you? \nTAO \n(DEFLATED) Yeah, I know. \nWALT Aw, go on. I'm kidding. You could get a job, easy. \nBARBER Kid, you shoulda just started with \u0091Hi' or \u0091Hello.' \nWALT Right. You should have said, \u0091Excuse me, I'm looking for a haircut if you have time.' \nBARBER Yeah. Be polite, but don't kiss ass. \nWALT Or, even better is act like you just got off a construction job. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 85 Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting your car fixed. \nBARBER Right. Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me. Screwed me right in the ass. \nWALT Exactly. Don't swear at the guy you're talking to, swear about another guy who ain't there. My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling tonight. \nBARBER Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk. \nWALT See? You come back in, Toad. Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about. It ain't rocket science. \nTAO Yeah, but I don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend. Walt and the Barber laugh. \nBARBER Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance. \nWALT Just go back outside and try it again. And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever. Come in and act like a man, Toad. Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in. \nTAO Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy... you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nWALT (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 86 Walt and the Barber laugh... \nTAO Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job. Walt and the Barber laugh harder. \nINT. WALT'S OLD PICKUP TRUCK - MORNING \nWALT If you do this, you're going to follow through, right? \nTAO Yeah, yeah. \nWALT No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in yes, sir, I'll do my best. \nTAO Yes, I'll do my best. \nWALT You better, because when I vouch for someone, it's my word and I don't want anyone making me look bad. \nTAO No, I'm good. I'm totally into this. \nWALT And don't lay down to people all the time. Always look a person in the eye. When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him. Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao. \nWALT Here, stuff these in your back pocket. \nTAO Cool. \nWALT Just don't blow this. \nCONTINUED: (4) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 87 Walt and Tao walk up to the Superintendent's Office Trailer on a construction job site. \nINT. JOB TRAILER - SAME TIME \nWalt and Tao come in. Walt shakes hands with TIM KENNEDY, the job super. \nWALT Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya? \nKENNEDY Shitty, but who's gonna listen? \nWALT Not me. Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee. \nKENNEDY Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 90 \nTAO Cool. Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao. \nWALT And you need this too. That should about do it. \nTAO Not to bitch, but won't I be needing some tools? \nWALT Tools I got, but I ain't loaning you my tool belt. You can buy tools as you go. \nTAO I appreciate all this. \nWALT Aw, forget it. \nTAO No, I really do. Thank you. Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye. Tao doesn't know what to expect. A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his and they SHAKE HANDS. It's really quite a moment for both of them. \nEXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON \nTao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder. Tao looks tired after working, but content. He walks past an abandoned lot. The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops. Smokie, Spider and company get out. Tao looks nervous, but remains calm. \nTAO What now? \nSPIDER Just seeing what you're up to, cuz. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 91 \nTAO I'm getting home from work, not that you guys would know much about that. \nSPIDER So it's true? You got a job. \nTAO Come on, what do you guys want with me? \nSMOKIE Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you think? I've been sooooo easy on you, but I can't just go on like nothing happened. \nTAO You can't just leave me alone? \nSMOKIE Afraid not. The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt. \nTAO Keep your hands off my stuff. \nSMOKIE Your stuff? You and everything you have is mine. I own you. Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building. \nSMOKIE You can't just walk away from us, Tao. It looks bad. It makes me look bad. Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales... \nSMOKIE What's the phrase I'm looking for? Oh yeah, I need to \u0091save face.' Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek. Tao screams as his flesh burns. \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 92 \nEXT. WALT'S ALLEY - MORNING \nWalt spots Tao as he takes out the trash. \nWALT Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction. \nTAO Hey, I gotta run. \nWALT Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days? \nTAO Busy. Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away. Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn. \nWALT What in the hell happened to you? \nTAO Don't worry about it. \nWALT Don't worry about it? Look at your goddamned face! \nTAO I said don't worry about it. It's not your problem. Walt looks at the ground and spits. \nWALT When? \nTAO Couple days ago. Grabbed me after I got off the bus coming home from work. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 96 \nSUE Look at you smile, old man. Kicking back, having a good old time. You're sure pleased with yourself today. \nTAO And it's a little unnerving if you ask me. \nWALT Aw, go on. \nSUE No, admit it. You are. You're feeling pretty good, aren't you? \nWALT Well, who wouldn't? I'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day. Great food, good friends. Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once. \nTAO It never ends. \nWALT I'm just kidding. Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum. If Tao doesn't ask you out soon, I will. \nSUE Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's a white devil. \nWA XAM \n(LAUGHS) I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it. \nWALT I'll be damned. Movie? Dinner? Wa Xam and Tao nod. They're a bit embarrassed. \nSUE Yeah, they're taking the bus. \nWALT The bus?! That's no good. A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 97 \nTAO Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO. \nTAO The Gran Torino? You'd let me drive it? \nWALT Sure. Why not. \nTAO Really? Walt smiles. \nWALT Really. They shake hands. \nINT. WALT'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWalt watches baseball. He hears a car outside. Shouts are heard and glass breaks. Walt gets up and looks out the shades... TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN! Windows shatter and the siding splinters. FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nWalt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds. Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to Tao -- making sure no one's been hit. \nWALT Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his neck. He's stunned. \nWALT Oh no. Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt. Walt probes around Tao's neck. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 98 \nTAO What... what is it? \nWALT Hang on... you're just cut, is all. \nTAO Is everybody else okay? \nWALT Yeah. Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao follows his gaze. \nTAO It's a miracle no one was killed. \nWALT They aimed high. Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls. \nWALT Where's Sue? \nTAO She went to our aunt's. \nWALT Call her. \nPAGE 102 Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them. He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig. \nFATHER JANOVICH Damn all this. It just isn't fair. \nWALT Nothing's fair, Father. Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile. \nFATHER JANOVICH So, what are you going to do, Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT Call me Walt. Father Janovich nods. \nFATHER JANOVICH Alright, what are you going to do, Walt? \nWALT Not sure yet. All I do know is they don't have a goddamned chance. \nINT. WALT'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nWalt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking coffee. Tao comes in without even knocking on the door. \nTAO What are you doing? \nWALT I'm thinking. \nTAO Thinking time is over. Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks. \nWALT I know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down. \nTAO What?! \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 103 \nWALT You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made. Back away from what's happened, Tao. \nTAO No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you. This is going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in. \nWALT Sit down. \nTAO I don't want to sit. \nWALT I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second and don't say anything. Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together. \nWALT I know what needs to be done. I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I'm the right man for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done. \nTAO I say we go now. Right now. \nWALT And do what? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood. What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing. \nWALT Trust me, Tao. Cool down and we'll meet back here at four. Okay? Tao doesn't answer. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 104 \nWALT I said \u0091okay?' You won't do anything without me. You meet me back here at four? Say \u0091okay.' \nTAO Okay. Tao storms out the back door. Walt pours more coffee. \nINT. BATHROOM \nWalt soaks in the tub. It's filled with bubbles. Walt looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner. Walt lights a CIGARETTE and exhales. Daisy curls up her lips at the smoke. \nWALT I know, I know. Give me a break, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house. \nEXT. WALT'S YARD - DAY \nWalt meticulously mows his lawn. He carefully trims around the fence and birdbath. \nINT. OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP \nMartin finishes cutting Walt's hair. \nBARBER There, all done. Ten bucks American. \nWALT I don't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian mummy? \nBARBER You? A straight shave? You've never ordered a straight shave, ever. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT Is that so? \nFATHER JANOVICH It is. And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning. \nWALT I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead. \nFATHER JANOVICH Go in peace. \nWALT I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits. Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair. \nFATHER JANOVICH Je -- zuz -- Christ. \nINT. WALT'S KITCHEN - 3:51 P.M. \nWalt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled. Tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons -- The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL. Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE. \nTAO Which one do I get? \nWALT You ever fire a weapon? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 108 \nTAO No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target. \nWALT Put that down. I got something for you. \nTAO What? \nWALT In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was the only one who came back... I received the Silver Star. I want you to have it. \nTAO Why? \nWALT When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it's similar. We're walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight. \nTAO The hell we won't. We're going to roll in there and tear ass. \nWALT Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute. \nTAO How many? \nWALT How many what? \nTAO How many men did you kill in Korea? \nWALT Thirteen for sure. Probably more. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 109 \nTAO What was it like to kill a man? \nWALT You don't want to know. \nTAO Why not? \nWALT Go get the Silver Star. It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it. Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely. AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud \nCLICK. Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws things. \nTAO What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!! \nWALT Quit smashing everything. You'll never get out of there, so just relax. \nTAO You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao. \nWALT You want to know how it feels to kill a man? It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_input": "FATHER JANOVICH Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn't remember the last time you went. \nWALT Is that so? \nFATHER JANOVICH It is. Walt drains his lowball glass. \nWALT Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary. \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 9 \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - LATER \nPeople are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks. Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home. The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER ANGLE Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window. \nMITCH I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless. Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance. \nWALT Fine. Go. \nMITCH I'll call in a few, see how you're doing. Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off. \nWALT Kill you to buy American. \nINT. LAND CRUISER - SAME TIME \nMITCH Did you see him look at the truck? It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go. \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 10 \nKAREN At least he didn't say anything this time. \nMITCH He didn't have to. \nKAREN Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years. \nMITCH And I suppose that's my goddamned fault? \nBACK ON WALT \nWalt gets his guests' engine running. As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes. The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard. The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder. It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to Daisy. \nWALT Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians. \nINT. HMONG HOUSE NEXT DOOR - SAME TIME \nThe house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak their native language, the younger generation speaks both English and Hmong. (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.) Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry. Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household. It's not our way. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 11 \nMAN \n(SUBTITLED) What about Tao? \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) What about him? \nMAN \n(SUBTITLED) He's the man in the house. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Tao's not a man. \n(GESTURES) Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman. Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys. The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink, without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an insult. In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong \u0093Soul Calling\u0094 ceremony starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is present and begins the ritual. As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips on his coat and goes out the back door. \n", "test1_true": "Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow. Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye contact as Tao passes. Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy. \nWALT I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his age. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT \nTao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 12 A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when -- WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the snow. A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand around the stunned, prone Tao. \nHEAD LATINO Whatta you gonna do, gook? You gonna \u0091Kung Fu' us? Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike. \nLATINO #2 Surprised it ain't a girl's bike. The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground. \nHEAD LATINO You gonna get up or what? Tao doesn't move. \nHEAD LATINO Tell you what, I'll let you take the first swing. You drop me and you can have your bike back. Tao smiles, he can't help it. \nHEAD LATINO What the fuck you smiling at, gook? Something funny? He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet. \nHEAD LATINO You better get the fuck outta here, bitch. He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow. This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos. The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike. \nEXT. WALT'S HOUSE - SUNNY SPRING MORNING \nSUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 13 Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses. Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown. Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed a chicken coop. Walt looks down at Daisy -- \nWALT Damn chinks let their yards go to hell. Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass. \nWALT I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block. This used to be a nice neighborhood. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nTao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning. \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move? He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here. All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away. Look at him strut like a rooster. She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black. \nINT. WALT'S HOUSE - DAY \nDaisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell rings; Daisy doesn't even move. Walt walks to the front door holding a roll of duct tape. The doorbell rings again. Walt looks down at Daisy -- \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 14 \nWALT Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf? Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is Father Janovich. \nFATHER JANOVICH Hi there, Walt. \nWALT Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt? \nFATHER JANOVICH Sorry... Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT So, what are you peddling now? \nFATHER JANOVICH Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. Haven't seen you in church in awhile. \nWALT Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski. \nWALT I don't think so, kid. Sorry. \nFATHER JANOVICH Why? Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski? \nWALT You don't want to know. \n", "test1_id": 2394, "test2_input": "MITCH To hell with him, kicking us out on his birthday?! We should've stayed home with Ashley and Josh. They knew better, they wouldn't even come. The goddamned kids are smarter than we are! Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch with a can of Pabst. Daisy comes out and lies at his feet. Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A dime-sized circle of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand. Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer. \nEXT. WALT'S PORCH - EVENING \nWalt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 46 Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's wedding photo. Walt looks down at Daisy -- \nWALT We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy. A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full swing. Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house. Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch. \nSUE Hey, Walt, what are you up to? Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand. \nSUE We're having a barbecue. You want to come over? \nWALT What do you think? \nSUE There's tons of food. \nWALT I'll bet. Just keep your paws off my dog. \nSUE No worries, we only eat cats. \nWALT Really? \nSUE No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come on, come on over. You can be my special guest. \nWALT I'm fine right here. Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. It's empty, just water and ice. \nWALT Son of a bitch. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 47 \nSUE What have you had to eat today, Walt? \nWALT A piece of cake and some beef jerky. \nSUE Come on over and get something to eat. We've got beer, too. Walt exhales loudly -- \nWALT Oh, what the hell. It's my birthday, I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself. Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house. \nSUE Happy Birthday, Wally. \nWALT Don't call me Wally. \nINT. TAO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN \nInside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a sore thumb. Total fish out of water. Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his shoulder. \nWALT You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst. \nSUE As they say, When in Hmong. \nWALT Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm here? Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the ground. \nSUE It's fine. Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt. \nCONTINUED: (2) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 48 \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) You, get out. Out of our house! (to Sue) What is he doing here? Walt cringes at her presence. \nWALT What'd she say? \nSUE She said welcome to our home. \nWALT No she didn't. \nSUE No, she didn't. \n", "test2_true": "(SUBTITLED) Why is this white man in our home? A man like him brings nothing, nothing but sorrow and death. Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt. The relatives are embarrassed at the outburst. \nWALT She hates me. \nSUE Yes, she hates you. \nWALT What did I do? A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt. \nWALT What?! What the hell are all you fish heads looking at?! Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room. \nSUE Maybe we should go in the other room. \nINT. DINING ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nSue explains a few facts to Walt. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 49 \nSUE A lot of the people in this house are very traditional. Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child. Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so don't do that. \nWALT That's dumb, but fine. \nSUE Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude. That's why everyone looks away when you look at them. \nWALT Swell. Anything else? \nSUE Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they're yelled at or get into a confrontation. It's a cultural thing. It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they're laughing at you. \nWALT Good God, you people are all nuts. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nWalt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a relative. Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him. Walt interrupts Sue. \nWALT Hey, Sue. \nSUE What? \nWALT You said you guys don't look you in the eye, but that guy keeps staring at me. Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 50 \nSUE This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor family shaman. \nWALT Witch doctor? Sue smiles and nods. \nSUE Something like that. The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards. \nWALT Boo-ga, boo-ga. Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and translates to Walt. \nSUE Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what you did. He says he would like to read you. \nWALT Huh? \nSUE He wants to read you. Tell you your soul. It'd be rude not to allow him this, it's a great honor. \nWALT Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away. Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long time. Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to himself. Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly. As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction. \nSUE Kor Khue says that you think you've been disrespected. You do not live your life. Your food has no flavor. You are scared of your past. \nCONTINUED: \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 51 You stopped living years and years ago. Kor Khue says you're not at peace. Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the head. Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat from his forehead. \nWALT Excuse me. Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up. \nWALT Je -- zuz -- Christ. Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying on. Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder. Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and offer tea and cookies from a tray. Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom. Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue comes in and looks at Walt. \n", "test2_id": 2395, "test3_input": "PAGE 113 \nPHONG \n(SUBTITLED) Who was that? Where are you going? You tell me what's going on?! Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside. On her way over to Walt's house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong's chair. It scares Sue even more. \nEXT. SMOKIE'S DUPLEX - AFTERNOON \nFather Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid of all day. \nOFFICER Sorry, Father, we have to go. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'm telling you. If we're not here, there will be bloodshed. \nOFFICER We've been here for hours. We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'm begging you to stay. \nOFFICER I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug. \nFATHER JANOVICH I'm staying. \nOFFICER No you aren't. My orders are specific. You came with us, you're leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off. Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore. \nWALT \n(MUTTERS) What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves. \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 114 Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex. Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows. \nWALT Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows? Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch. Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground. \nSMOKIE I wasn't sure that you'd... \nWALT Shut up, gook. I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL. \nWALT That's right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their guns. \nWALT You have no honor. You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will mourn. You won't be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of fear. \nSMOKIE Where's Tao, old man? He too scared to come and stick up for himself? \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 115 \nWALT No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren't worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS around. Walt laughs. \nWALT You boys are a little bit jumpy. \nSPIDER You watch it, old man. \nWALT No, I think you'd better watch it. Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALT'S HOUSE \nSue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and pounds down the stairs. \nSUE Tao? Tao, are you alright? \nTAO (O.S.) \nI'M DOWN HERE! LET ME OUT!! She unlocks the CELLAR DOOR. Tao comes out in a rage. \nTAO Goddamn it! \nSUE What's going on? \nTAO He left without me! \nSUE Where? Where'd he go?! \nTAO He went to Smokie's without me. Tao takes the stairs two steps at a time. \n", "test3_true": "(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 116 \nSUE No! No, Tao! Sue grabs Tao's legs and hangs on. \nSUE No! Don't you dare! Stay away from them, Tao! I don't want anyone else getting hurt. \nTAO Leave me alone. \nSUE \nNO, TAO. NO! They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the kitchen floor. Tao runs for the door when something catches his eye... The kitchen table. The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there. Walt purposely left the guns at home. \nTAO Oh God! NO!! \nQUICK CUT BACK TO: \nEXT. SMOKIE'S DUPLEX - SAME TIME \nWALT AND COMPANY... \nWALT Anybody got a light? No? I got one. Walt's slight grin fades. He mutters to himself... \nWALT Hail Mary, full of grace. Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE. BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream. Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand. Walt never intended to kill anyone. Self-sacrifice. \nCONTINUED: \nPAGE 117 \nEXT. SMOKIE'S DUPLEX - LATER \nTao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are being driven away in Police cars. Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer looks tough or hard, he just looks scared. On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance crew. Father Janovich prays over him. Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER. \nTAO What happened? \nPOLICE OFFICER You have to step back. \nTAO He was a friend of mine. \nPOLICE OFFICER I said step back. Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER. \nTAO What happened, man? The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE OFFICER and then to Tao. \nHMONG POLICE OFFICER You heard him, step back. Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language. \nTAO \n(SUBTITLED) Please, man, it's important. He's my friend. Tell me what happened? \nHMONG POLICE OFFICER \n(SUBTITLED) The old guy reaches for a lighter and they gunned him down. The gang said the old guy was here to kill them, but he didn't have a weapon. \nTAO \n(SUBTITLED) What's going to happen? \n(CONTINUED) \nPAGE 118 \nHMONG POLICE OFFICER \n(SUBTITLED) We actually have witnesses for once. These guys are going away big time. The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER. \nPOLICE OFFICER Officer Chang, get those people back. \nHMONG POLICE OFFICER Yes, sir. You have to step back now. Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in. He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over him. \nEXT. TAO'S HOUSE - DAY \nTao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a traditional Hmong dress. A TAXI pulls up and they get in. Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently petting the old dog. \nINT. CATHOLIC CHURCH \nWe're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski. Walt is dressed in his new suit. Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated near the front. Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a dirty look. Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right through Mitch. Mitch looks away. Father Janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks. \nCONTINUED: \n", "test3_id": 2396}

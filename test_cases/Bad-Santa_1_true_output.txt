He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gin's 4 X 4 and clamps the other ends on Gin's ears. A small jolt and a spark or two. Only a minor shock. 
MARCUS Shit! 
He grabs Gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front tire of the van. Gin tries to crawl out of the way. 
ANGLE ON: Gin's feet slipping on the gravel. 
MARCUS Put it in reverse. 
ANGLE ON: shift level moving into REVERSE. 
ANGLE ON: Lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal. 
WIDER: Lois drives backwards. There's a bump and the sound of a dull POP. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - NEXT DAY 
CLOSE-UP: A large bubble gum bubble pops. 
Willie, in a self-medicated stupor, barely managing to hold a wailing toddler on his lap. Bubble gum is all over the Kid's face. 
WILLIE 'Tendo it is. 
He passes the child off to Marcus, who holds it as Willie gazes off and murmurs; 
WILLIE ...Everything I touch turns to shit and dies. 
Marcus, still holding the child, quickly glances around, and then hisses into Willie's ear: 
MARCUS What are you, drinking Sterno now? 'Cause you're sounding like my Aunt Tilly right before she smeared her own shit on the bedroom walls and we had to lock her up and she spent the rest of her life with a shaved head and eating lunch through a tube up her nose... 
Willie continues to stare, head swaying. 
MARCUS ...You better be in shape by this evening, fat man. After tonight, I don't give a shit. But this is the time to reach deep down and suck it up. 
Marcus hands the kid to his Mother. He smiles warmly. 
MARCUS ...Lovely boy. 
INT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - NIGHT 
"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas" plays as a buzzing throng of people crams the mall. 
One current in this sea of humanity flows into the bedecked entrance of Chamberlain's Department Store. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Jesse the security guard is at his post near the doors to the parking lot. He smiles and waves farewell to departing shoppers. 
INTERCOM (V.O.) Attention shoppers, the store will be closing in five minutes. We wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah and a joyous Kwanza. 
Behind Jesse, in Men's Wear, is Lois, wearing a frown of pruney disapproval. Seeing that he's not looking, she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over. 
SQUEEEEEEEAK! The table makes a loud noise, but it's too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice. Satisfied with her placement of the table, Lois heads out the door. 
INT. CHAMBERAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - NIGHT 
Bleary-eyed Willie puts down a little girl and she happily scampers off. 
WILLIE Barbie it is... 
Willie turns to Marcus. 
WILLIE ...That it?

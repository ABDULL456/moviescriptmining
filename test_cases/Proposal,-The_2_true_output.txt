(BEAT) Why did you tell them all that? 
MARGARET It was getting too messy.   We weren't going to be able to keep it up. 
RICHARD Don't start lying to me now. Margaret stops for a moment. 
MARGARET I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I think she meant what she said.   She's a great girl, you should stay.   It's the right thing.   You're perfect for each other. 
RICHARD But... but what about you?   What are you gonna do? Margaret wants to keep the conversation short. 
MARGARET Don't worry about me.   I'll survive. 
RICHARD So what?   This is it? 
MARGARET Yup.   This is it. 
Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard. Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(SINCERE) Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good person.   You deserve it. She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but Margaret denies it. MARGARET (cont'd) Goodbye, Richard. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.   She can hear that the party is in full swing and smiles. 
EXT. BOAT - DAY 
Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud. The two have to yell to talk. 
MR. GILBERTSON I want you to say the words. 
MARGARET I'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now? 
MR. GILBERTSON Say it. Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this. 
MARGARET I'll publish your book. Gilbertson smiles. 
MR. GILBERTSON Now was that so hard? 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore. Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers. 
GERTRUDE So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a million questions for you tomorrow... Gertrude sits down next to Richard. 
GERTRUDE (cont'd) ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here and drink beer.   OK? Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer. 
RICHARD Thanks. Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss. When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed. Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong. 
GERTRUDE You have been practicing. 
RICHARD Waddya mean? 
GERTRUDE Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man whore down there. Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light. GERTRUDE (cont'd) You're gonna have to put that in check if you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real options up here... and I'll kick that bitch's ass. Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to joke.   Gertrude notices. GERTRUDE (cont'd) So no jokes yet?   Too soon? 
RICHARD I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused. 
GERTRUDE That kiss didn't seem "confused." Richard takes a beat to collect himself. 
RICHARD You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought about being with you for a long time.   A long time.   When you said those things at the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you say those things. 
(MORE) 
RICHARD                                                         (cont'd) But as crazy as this seems.   I know now... that we're just not meant to be. Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched. RICHARD (cont'd) Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret? I felt sick.   For the three years we worked together, I wanted to be as far away from her as possible.   But now that she's gone? I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me. What is that? The question hangs in the air. 
GERTRUDE I don't know. 
RICHARD I think I have to find out.

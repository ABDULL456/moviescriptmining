INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - CONTINUOUS 
Thousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body to arch. After several seconds the power shuts off. Tendrils of white smoke rise from the copper halo. Logan opens his eyes and stares at Cornelius. 
LOGAN That all you got? 
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CORNELIUS (to his assistant) This could take a while. Raise the amperage by forty percent. 
INT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins. Kayla stands by the window, picking at her fingers. 
KAYLA You're going to let Victor kill that woman. Stryker and Collins ignore her. KAYLA (cont'd) When you got me out of prison, you told me we were going to help people. Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up. 
STRYKER We are. We're saving humanity. 
KAYLA From the mutants? The phone rings. Stryker answers it. 
STRYKER Yes? 
(LISTENING) Good. I'm coming down. (hanging up; to Collins) The Eleven is ready. He stands and heads for the door. Collins follows. In the doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla. STRYKER (cont'd) Don't worry, my sweet. You're one of the good ones. I'll protect you. He and Collins exit the room, leaving Kayla alone with her misery. 
INT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY 
Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of electricity. It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging. 
INT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Cornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable sympathy. They turn when Kayla walks into the room. 
KAYLA Is he clean yet? Cornelius and the assistant face front again.. 
CORNELIUS He's stronger than I thought. We could be here all night.. Kayla watches Logan in his agony. A glimmer of remorse passes over her face. 
KAYLA He was good to me. Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile.

We realize we've been watching a newsreel. We SEE the SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award. 
ANNOUNCER Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God. 
City Hall steps. Judge Hillier and other BIGWIGS speaking heatedly to reporters. 
ANNOUNCER This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian -- 
Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small CROWD of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors. 
ANNOUNCER Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense. 
LILLIAN (emphatically) Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home. 
Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAY 
Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up. 
FRANCES Hi Emma. 
Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play. 
FRANCES Bye Emma. 
Frances shakes her head as she walks on. 
MAN'S VOICE Hey! 
Frances hesitates, then turns to look: 
A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her. 
HARRY (friendly) C'mere. I wanna talk to you. 
Frances keeps walking. Harry hurries after her. 
HARRY Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? (reaches her, grabs her arm) Hey! 
FRANCES Don't touch me. 
HARRY I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk. 
She stares at him. He's got a newspaper wedged under one arm. 
FRANCES (waiting) Okay then... 
HARRY Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? 
FRANCES I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think? 
HARRY Not me. But other people seem to. 
FRANCES Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. 
HARRY Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? 
FRANCES (examining him) No... Actually, you look more like a cop. 
Harry laughs. 
HARRY That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right? (holding coat open) You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down. 
Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed. 
FRANCES I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then? 
HARRY Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here. 
FRANCES (smiles & points to him) Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel! 
HARRY (embarrassed) Yeah, well -- 
FRANCES You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski... 
HARRY Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you? 
FRANCES Whattaya mean? 
HARRY Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist -- 
FRANCES But I'm not. The newspapers're -- 
HARRY Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy. 
FRANCES Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess. 
Beat. 
HARRY Sure don't talk like you're sixteen. 
FRANCES Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose. 
HARRY I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.

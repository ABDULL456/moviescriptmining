{"test1_input": "The word detonates a fit of coughing. \n. . . You are not going. That is no part of it. \nMattie You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off. \nRooster I am a bonded U.S. marshal! \nMattie That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done. \nRooster You never said anything about this. I cannot go up against Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at the same time. \nMattie I am not a baby. \nRooster I will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds and plates of hot grub on the table. It will be traveling fast and eating light. What little sleeping is done will take place on the ground. \nMattie I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories. We had a good time. \nRooster Coon hunting! This ain't no coon hunt, it don't come within forty miles of being a coon hunt! \nMattie It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money. I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House. \nRooster stares, nonplussed. \nHe drops back into the rope bed, which sets it swaying. As he stares up at the ceiling: \nRooster Leave the money. Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt. \nGRANDMA TURNER'S ROOM \nMattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma Turner snores. She unrolls her father's traps and takes out a big-brimmed fisherman's hat and puts it on: too big. She lines it with newspaper, experimenting with the amount until it fits. She puts on his coat, gives the sleeves a big cuff. She examines the Colt's dragoon. She drops apples into a sack. \nShe finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope. Throughout, we have been hearing its contents in voice-over: \nMattie Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure. Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere Papa's death is avenged? My investigations in Fort Smith lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found and brought to justice, and I have made arrangements to that end. I will return to you once I have seen them properly carried through. . . \nEXTERIOR BOARDING HOUSE \nMattie is cinching her gear onto Little Blackie. She mounts and rides off as the letter ends: \nMattie But do not worry on my account. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. The author of all things watches over me. And I have a fine horse. Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek. I am off for the Choctaw Nation. \nINTERIOR GROCERY \nTracking toward Rooster's rope bed. A hat is pulled down over the face of the figure reclining in it. Smoke sifts up from somewhere. \nMattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern. She pulls the hat off. It is the elderly Chinese grocer. \nMattie Where is Marshal Cogburn! \nThe grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it. His manner is dreamy. \nGrocer Went away. . . \nMattie Away! Where? \nThe grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to Mattie. He closes his eyes and drifts away. \nMattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads: \nMattie Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn. \nMattie's jaw tightens. She abruptly crumples the paper. \nRIVER \nMattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width. At the near-side ferry station a raft enclosed by railing waits, its guide rope strung across the river. A pilot idles on the near shore. \nOn the far shore two small figures, mounted, ascend the opposite bank. Mattie draws up in front of the ferryman at the edge of the river. \nMattie Is that Marshal Cogburn? \nFerryman That is the man. \nMattie Who's he with? \nFerryman I do not know. \nMattie Take me across. \n", "test1_true": "Ferryman So you're the runaway. Marshal told me you'd show up. I'm to present you to the sheriff. \nMattie That is a story. Let go my horse. I have business across the river. \nThe ferryman is leading Little Blackie back up the hill toward the town. Mattie cranes around to look at the two small figures across the river. They have twisted in their saddles to look back. \n. . . Look Slim, if you don't turn around and take me across you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be. I have a good lawyer. \nFerryman Name ain't Slim. \nShe looks at the dull man's unresponsive back. She twists to look across the river. \nThe two mounted figures are breaking their look back and resuming their climb up the bank. \nMattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn and pegs it, hard as she can, at the ferryman. \nIt hits him square in the back of the head. He reacts, reaching to his head and dropping the reins. \nMattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them back. She saws Little Blackie around and sends him galloping for the river. \nMattie Run, Little Blackie! \nFerryman Hey! \nShe urges the horse, at the gallop, into the river. \nThe splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the two men across the river. \nAs the horse goes further into the river its up-and-down gait slows, the water offering resistance. \nThe ferryman has run down to the bank. He stoops for a rock and throws it. It misses by a mile. \nLittle Blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming. \nThe two men across the river, having twisted to look, now rein their horses round to face the action. But they do not advance. They rest forearms on pommels and watch. \nLittle Blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a swift current. \nMattie Good, Little Blackie! \nLittle Blackie's head dips as he finds his feet again. He slogs laboriously to what is now the nearer shore. \nThe two men up the bank impassively watch. \nThe horse and Mattie emerge fully from the river, dripping. \nMattie taps heels against Little Blackie's flanks and walks him slowly up the bank. She stops many yards short of the two men--Rooster and LeBoeuf. \nA silent standoff as Little Blackie breathes heavily. The two expressionless men still have not stirred. \nAt length: \nRooster That's quite a horse. \nA long pause. \n. . . I will give you ten dollars for him. \nMattie From the money you stole from me? \nRooster That was not stolen. I'm out for your man. \nMattie I was to accompany you. If I do not, there is no agreement and my money was stolen. \nRooster licks his lips, thinking. \nLeBoeuf Marshal, put this child back on the ferry. We have a long road, and time is a-wasting. \nMattie If I go back, it is to the office of the U.S. marshals to report the theft of my money. And futile, Marshal Cogburn-- \"Pursuit would be futile\"?--is not spelt f-u-d-e-l. \nA heavy silence as Cogburn stares at her. \nLeBoeuf looks between the two, waiting for Rooster to take action. Gathering that he will not, LeBoeuf slides off his horse. \nMattie watches as he walks to Little Blackie, holding up a gentling hand for the horse to sniff at and nuzzle. \nHe abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other grabs Mattie's ankle. He pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard, tumbling Mattie to the ground. \nLeBoeuf Little sister, it is time for your spanking. \n", "test1_id": 225, "test2_input": "LeBoeuf What's going on? \nRooster (testy) This is a business conversation. \nLeBoeuf Is that what you call it. It sounds to me like you are still being hoorawed by a little girl. \nRooster Did you say hooraw! \nLeBoeuf That was the word. \nRooster I will show you hooraw! \nMattie There is no hoorawing in it. My agreement with the Marshal antedates yours. It has the force of law. \nLeBoeuf (amused) The force of law! This man is a notorious thumper! He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson! \nRooster Those men was patriots, Texas trash! \nLeBoeuf They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas. \nRooster I have heard that too. It is a damned lie! What army was you in, mister? \nLeBoeuf I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith-- \nRooster What side was you on? \nLeBoeuf I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't have to hang my head when I say it! \nRooster If you had served with Captain Quantrill-- \nLeBoeuf Captain Quantrill indeed! \nRooster You had best let this go, LeBoeuf! \nLeBoeuf Captain of what! \nRooster Good, then! There are not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions, day and night. Our agreement is nullified--it's each man for himself! \nLeBoeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse. \nLeBoeuf That suits me! \nHe saws the horse around. \n. . . Congratulations, Cogburn. You have graduated from marauder to wetnurse. Adios! \nLeBoeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of spurs, and Rooster, seething, turns back to his work. \nAs the hoofbeats recede, Mattie sounds a note of regret: Mattie We don't need him, do we Marshal? \nRooster (muttering) We'll miss his Sharp's carbine. It's apt to get lively out here. \nEXTERIOR BAGBY'S STORE \nA mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is tied off to the porch of the ramshackle store. The beast is strangling as the rope is too tight, and he is being poked with sticks by two motley-dressed Indian boys up on the porch. \nRooster enters and cuts the rope. The mule brays and canters off, shaking its head, rope dangling. \nIndian Youth Hey. \nRooster is already mounting the steps to the porch. \nRooster Call that sport, do ya? \nHe kicks the first youth hard in the ass, sending him sprawling off the porch into the dirt. The second backs against the railing and Rooster shoves him in the chest so that he flips backward to also land in the dirt. \nRooster Stay here sister. I will see Bagby. \nMattie, astride Little Blackie, holds the reins of Cogburn's horse. As he disappears inside the two youths climb back onto the porch. They sit at the lip, feet dangling, and stare sullenly at Mattie. She stares back. \nMINUTES LATER \nThe youths have not moved. The door bangs open and Rooster emerges. \nMattie Has Chaney been here? Rooster No. \nCrossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the dirt again. The other youth scampers out of footreach. Rooster starts down the stairs. \nRooster But Coke Hayes was, two days ago. Coke runs with Lucky Ned. He bought supplies, with this. \n", "test2_true": "Mattie This is Papa's gold piece! Tom Chaney, here we come! \nRooster It is not the world's only California gold piece. \nMattie They are rare, here. \nRooster They are rare. But if it is Chaney's, it could just as easily mean that Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him, as that he fell in with them. Chaney could be a corpse. These are a rough lot. \nMattie That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal. What do we do? \nRooster mounts up. \nRooster We pursue. Ned is unfinished business for the marshals anyhow, and when we have him we will also have Chaney --or we can learn the whereabouts of his body. Bagby doesn't know which way they went, but now we know they come through here, they couldn't be going but one of two ways: north toward the Winding Stair Mountains, or pushing on further west. I suspect north. There is more to rob. \nThe youth who was kicked into the dirt is dusting himself off. He has been listening without interest. \nYouth Mr. Ferrington will want to know who cut loose his mule. \nRooster reins his horse around to go. \nRooster Tell him it was Mr. James, a bank examiner from Clay County, Missouri. \nYouth The James boys is said to be slight, Frank and Jesse both. \nRooster One of them has grown fat. The mule will not range far. You boys mend your ways or I will return some dark night and cut off one of your heads--I do not say which--and leave it on the stomach of the other as a warning. \nRIDING \nRooster and Mattie ride abreast along a barely defined road. \nRooster Potter and I served with him at Elkhorn Tavern. Even latterly our activities was by and large martial. We did though, one time, run across a Yankee paymaster and relieve him of four thousand dollars in gold coin. Squealed like it was his own money. Well, since hostilities was officially ended it was technically criminal so Potter rode down to Arkansas and I went to Cairo Illinois with my share, started calling myself Burroughs and opened an eating place called The Green Frog. I married a grass widow but my drinking picked up and my wife did not like the company of my river friends. She decided to go back to her first husband, a clerk in a hardware store. She said, \"Goodbye, Reuben, a love for decency does not abide in you.\" I told her, \"Goodbye, Nola, I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy this time.\" She took my boy with her too. He never did like me anyhow. I guess I did speak awful rough to him but I did not mean nothing by it. You would not want to see a clumsier child than Horace. I bet he broke forty cups. . . \nHe frowns and draws up, looking at something. Mattie follows his look. \nA man is hanging in a tree--very high, perhaps thirty feet off the ground. The body slowly twists. The head seems unnaturally large. \nRooster Hey! \nAt Rooster's shout something separates from the head: we have been looking at not just the corpse's silhouette but that of a large carrion-eating bird as well, perched on the corpse's shoulder and feeding at the corpse's face. The bird flaps clumsily off. \nRooster gazes at the strung-up body. \nRooster Is it Chaney? \nMattie I would not recognize the soles of his feet. \nRooster gets off his horse, pulls a knife from his gear, and ambles to the tree. Mattie follows. \nWhen she arrives Rooster has started sawing at the rope that ties the body off, wrapped around a chest-high branch stump. Mattie looks up. \nShe is looking mostly at soles of feet as the foreshortened body twists slowly, high above. \nRooster Step back now. \nShe does. Rooster steps back as well as the almost-cut-through rope starts to unravel by itself, crazily twisting under the pressure and gently spinning the body above. \nThe rope snaps. It yanks violently upward, slapping branches. \nThe body drops--perhaps four feet--and jerks to a stop, jacknifing and dancing. \nRooster God damn it. \nThey both gaze up at the body. \nRooster Snagged. Well you are going to have to clamber on up with this knife. I am too old and too fat. \nUP IN THE TREE \nMattie is well up. \nWe hear Rooster's voice from below: \nRooster It had one billiard table, served ladies and men both but mostly men. I tried to run it myself a while but I couldn't keep good help and I never did learn how to buy meat. I was like a man fighting bees. Finally I give up and solt it and went out to see the country. \nMattie pauses, looking down. \nWe are over her. Rooster is foreshortened, a long way down, looking up, smoking a cigarette. He reacts to her look down: \nRooster You are doing well. \n", "test2_id": 226, "test3_input": "As Mattie descends to where hillside meets structure Rooster takes his rifle and walks around to the front door--crude planking hung on leather-strap hinges. His footsteps crunch in the snow. \nThe door is yanked open, inches, and a backlit face appears over a hand holding a revolver. Rooster halts. \nMan Who is out there? \nRooster We are looking for shelter. \nMan No room for you here! Ride on! \nThe door slams. \nAfter a moment the light inside goes out. \nMattie, arriving on the roof, looks steeply down on Rooster. He glances up, thinking. He does not sign. He looks back at the door. \nRooster Who all is in there? \nVoice Ride on! \nRooster looks up at Mattie. He nods. \nShe balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney. \nRooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels in the snow, raising his rifle. \nLong beat. \nMuffled coughs from inside the house--more than one person. \nActivity inside--yelling--the hiss of fire being doused. Suddenly: \nThe door flies open and--BANG! BANG!--two shotgun blasts. Slightest beat as Mattie peers into the yard, and then--BANG!--shot rips through the roof just at her feet. \nA rifle blast--from Rooster. A yelp of pain from inside. \nRooster I am a Federal officer! Who is in there? Speak up and be quick about it. \nNew Voice A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch! \nRooster cocks his head. \nRooster Is that Emmett Quincy? \nNew Voice I don't know any Emmett Quincy. \nRooster Listen here, Emmett Quincy. I know it is you! This is Rooster Cogburn. Columbus Potter and five other marshals is out here with me. We have got a bucket of coal oil. In one minute we will burn you out from both ends! Chuck your arms clear and come out with your hands locked on your head and you will not be harmed. Oncet that coal oil goes down the chimney we are killing everything that comes out the door! \nThinking beat. \nQuincy There's only two of you! \nRooster You go ahead and bet your life on it! How many of you is in there? \nQuincy Me and Moon, but he is hit! He can't walk! \nRooster Drag him out! Light that lamp! Thinking beat. \nQuincy Tell them other officers to be careful with their guns! We are coming out! \nThe door opens again. From the smoky black a shotgun and two revolvers are tossed out. Then, orange light: a lamp is lit. Two men emerge, one limping and holding onto the other, who holds high the lamp. \nRooster Down in the snow! Lie still while I cuff you! We is only two, but my man on the roof will shoot you if you get feisty. \nINSIDE \nRooster has coaxed the fire back to life. He peers into the large pot hanging over it. \nThe cuffed men sit side-by-side on a plank bench behind a plank table, staring at Mattie. Moon's leg is bound with a large blue handkerchief. \nQuincy sounds resentful: \nQuincy You said it was a man on the roof. I thought it was Potter. \nRooster You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form. \nHe stirs the pot with a wooden spoon. \n. . .This here's an awful lot of sofky. Was you boys looking for company? \n", "test3_true": "Moon nods agreement, but has a different thought: \nMoon Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think. \nRooster, continuing to nose around, pushes the canvas cover off a crate of bottles. Rooster And a good store of whiskey as well. What are you boys up to, outside of cooking banquets? You are way too jumpy. \nQuincy We didn't know who was out there weather like this. It might have been some crazy man. Anyone can say he is a marshal. \nMoon My leg hurts. \nRooster I'll bet it does. When is the last time you seen your old pard Ned Pepper? \nQuincy Ned Pepper? I don't know him. Who is he? \nRooster spoons sofky from the pot into a bowl \nRooster I'm surprised you don't remember him. He is a little fellow, nervous and quick. His lip is all messed up. \nQuincy That don't bring anybody to mind. \nRooster sits across from the men with his bowlful of sofky and starts eating. \nRooster There is a new boy that might be running with Ned. He is short himself and he has got a powder mark on his face, a black place. He calls himself Chaney, or Chelmsford sometimes. Carries a Henry rifle. \nQuincy That don't bring anybody to mind. Black mark, I would remember that. \nRooster You don't remember anything I want to know, do you Quincy? I hope you don't mind. . . \nRaises a spoonful. \n. . . There seems to be ample. What do you know, Moon? \nMoon looks at Quincy, who gives a hard look back. \nMoon I don't know those boys. I always try to help out the law. \nRooster By the time we get back to Fort Smith that leg will be swelled up tight as Dick's hatband. It will be mortified and they will cut it off. Then if you live I will get you two or three years in the Federal house up in Detroit. \nMoon You are trying to get at me. \nRooster They will teach you to read and write up there but the rest of it won't be so good. Them boys can be hard on a gimp. \nMoon You are trying to get at me. \nRooster You give me some good information on Ned and I will take you to McAlester's store tomorrow get that ball taken out of your leg. Then I will give you three days to clear the Territory. \nQuincy We don't know those boys you are looking for. \nRooster shrugs at Moon. \nRooster It ain't his leg. \nQuincy Don't go to flapping your mouth, Moon. It is best to let me do the talking. \nMoon I would say if I knew. . . Quincy We are weary trappers. \nHe reacts to Mattie, staring at him. \n. . . Who worked you over with the ugly stick? \nMattie's look shifts to Moon. \nMattie The man Chaney with the marked face killed my father. He was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to killing in the end. If you answer the marshal's questions he will help you. I have a good lawyer at home and he will help you too. \nBeat. \nMoon I am puzzled by this. (to Rooster) Why is she here? \nQuincy Don't go jawing with these people, Moon. Don't go jawing with that runt. \nMattie (to Quincy) I don't like you. I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not help you. \nMoon My leg is giving me fits. \nRooster Yes, a young fellow like you don't want to loose his leg. You are too young to be getting about on a willow peg. You love dancing and sport, carrying on. \nQuincy Easy now. He is trying to get at you. \nRooster I am getting at you with the truth. \n", "test3_id": 227}

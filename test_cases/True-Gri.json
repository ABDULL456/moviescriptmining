{"train": "TRUE GRIT \nAdaptation by \nJoel and Ethan Coen \nBased on the Novel by Charles Portis \nJune 12, 2009 \nWhite letters on a black screen: \nThe wicked flee when none pursueth. \nThe quotation fades. \nA woman's voice: \nVoice-Over People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood, but it did happen. \nThe street of a western town, night. The street is deserted. Snow falls. \nWe track slowly forward. \nI was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and robbed him of his life and his horse and two California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band. \nA shape lies in the street below the busted-out porch railing of a two-story building. A sign identifies the building as the Monarch Boarding House. \nPapa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney was \"down on his luck.\" If Papa had a failing it was his kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him. \nThe crumpled shape is a body. We hear the thunder of approaching hooves. \nHe had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the breast. \nA galloping horse enters frame and recedes, whipped on by a bareback rider. A long- barreled rifle is tied across the rider's back with a sash cord. \nHe disappears into the falling snow. \nChaney fled. He could have taken the time to saddle the horse--or hitched up three spans of mules to a Concord stagecoach and smoked a pipe, as it seems that no one in that city was inclined to give chase. Chaney had mistaken its citizens for men. \nDAY \nWe are looking into the window of a moving train. \nLooking out past us is a fourteen-year-old girl, Mattie Ross. Next to her is Yarnell, a middle-aged black man. Reading backward in the mirror of the window we see a station sign easing in as the train slows: FORT SMITH. \nThe voice-over continues: \nVoice-Over You might say, what business was it of my father's to meddle? My answer is this: he was trying to do that short devil a good turn. He was his brother's keeper. Does that answer your question? \nDEAD MAN'S FACE \nCandlelight flickers over the man's waxy features. \nVoice (Irish-accented) Is that the man? \nThe body, wrapped in a shroud, lies in a pine coffin. Mattie and Yarnell stand looking down at it. An undertaker, grizzled and severely dressed, holds the candle. \nYarnell Lord lord. \nMattie That is my father. Undertaker If you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight. \nYarnell He has gone home. Praise the lord. \nMattie Put the lid on. Why is it so much? \nUndertaker The quality of the casket and of the embalming. The loifloik appearance requires time and art. And the chemicals come dear. The particulars are in your bill. If you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight. \nMattie No. Thank you. The spirit has flown. Your wire said fifty dollars. \nUndertaker You did not specify he was to be shipped. \nMattie Well sixty dollars is every cent we have. It leaves nothing for our board. Yarnell, you can see to the body's transport to the train station and accompany it home, and I will have to sleep here tonight. \nYarnell I don't think your mama'd want you to stay in this town by yourself. \nMattie It can't be helped. I still have to collect father's things and see to some other business. \nYarnell But I's your chap-a-rone! Your mama didn't say for you to see to no business here! \nMattie Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney? \nThe sheriff looks at the girl and chuckles. \nSheriff You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters? \nMattie My answer is this: That is a silly question. I am here to settle my father's affairs. \nSheriff All alone? \nMattie I am the person for it. Mama was never any good at sums and she can hardly spell cat. I intend to see papa's killer hanged. \nSheriff I see. Well. Nothing prevents you from offering a reward, or from so informing a marshal. It would have to be real money, though, to be persuasive. Chaney is across the river in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country. It will not be a daisy-picking expedition. Upwards of three-score US marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory. \nMattie I will see to the money. Who's the best marshal? \nSheriff I would have to weigh that proposition. I reckon William Waters is the best tracker. He is half Comanche and it is something to see him cut for sign. The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn. He is a pitiless man, double tough and fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork. The best is probably L.T. Quinn, he brings his prisoners in alive. He may let one get by now and again but he believes even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake. Quinn is a good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot. He will not plant evidence or abuse a prisoner. He is as straight as string. Yes, I will say Quinn is about the best they have. \nMattie Where can I find this Rooster? \nMATTIE'S HAND \nRapping at a door of rough plank. \nAfter a beat, a voice--rasping and slurred: \nVoice The jakes is occupied. \nWider. We see that Mattie stands before an outhouse. \nMattie I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn. As I said, I have business with you. \nBeat. \nVoice I have prior business. \nMattie You have been at it for quite some time, Mr. Cogburn. \nVoice (roaring drunk) There is no clock on my business! To hell with you! To hell with you! How did you stalk me here?! \nMattie The sheriff told me to look in the saloon. In the saloon they referred me here. We must talk. \nVoice (outraged) Women ain't allowed in the saloon! \nMattie I was not there as a customer. I am fourteen years old. \nNo response. Mattie reaches up and raps again, vigorously. \nBeat. \nVoice (sullen) The jakes is occupied. And will be for some time. \nPLANK FLOOR \nA coffin is dropped heavily into frame and we see, chalked onto the freshly milled wood of its top: \nRoss Yell County Hold at station \nAfter a resting beat, during which the coffin's handlers presumably adjust their grip, the coffin is shoved away over the straw-littered planking of a rail freight car. Once it has been pushed fully in, the upright planking of the boxcar door blurs through frame in the extreme foreground til the door slams to rest. \nWe hear the steam engine start to chug, and the foreground door moves slowly off with the grinding motion of the train. \nSHOP DOOR \nSwinging open. It is the barnlike door to the mortician's workroom; the Irish undertaker holds it open for Mattie. She carries a bedroll. \nUndertaker You can sleep in a coffin if you loik. \nThree bodies lay under shrouds on a high work table. The arm of the nearest sticks out, rope burns on its wrist. Three coffins are in various stages of assembly. \nMattie unwinds the bedroll onto the floor. \nMattie Not. . . yet. \nSTREET Mattie strides along, looking at facades. She stops, looking at the signage on a barnlike building: \nCol. G. Stonehill. Licensed Auctioneer. Cotton Factor. \nINSIDE \nStonehill A what? All right, now listen very carefully as I will not bargain further. I will take the ponies back and keep the gray horse which is mine and settle for three hundred dollars. Now you must take that or leave it and I do not much care which it is. \nMattie Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything under three hundred twenty-five dollars. But I will settle for three hundred and twenty if I am given the twenty in advance. And here is what I have to say about the saddle-- \nSTREET \nWe are tracking down the street we toward the Monarch Boarding House. \nMattie is humping a saddle up the street. She stops before the boarding house. She looks at its sign. She looks at its busted-out porch railing. \nINSIDE THE PARLOR \nA Marjorie Main-like woman crushes Mattie to her bosom. \nMrs. Floyd Frank Ross's daughter. My poor child. My poor child. \nMattie grimaces, arms pinned to her sides. \nMattie You have my father's traps? \nMrs. Floyd Oh yes we do. My poor child. Are you gawna be stayin with us or are you hurrying home to your mother? \nMattie I am staying briefly. I have business with Marshal Rooster Cogburn. I found him in his cups today but I understand he's to be in court tomorrow, testifying. I mean to engage him to hunt down Tom Chaney. Mrs. Floyd Well god bless him for that. The tariff here is seventy-five cents for room and supper. That does not include your daytime eats. \nMattie Very well. \nMrs. Floyd Your father owed for two days, god bless him. \nMattie Oh. Well. \nMrs. Floyd You'll share a room with Grandma Turner. We've had to double up, what with all the people in town come to see the hanging Judge Parker's put on for us. \nMattie Yes, I witnessed the hanging myself. \nMrs. Floyd Was it a good'n? \nBEDROOM \nA blanket is unrolled to reveal a watch, a cheap knife, and a long-barreled Colt's dragoon revolver. Voice off: \nMrs. Floyd This was in the poor man's room. This is everything, there are no light fingers in this house. If you need something for to tote the gun around I will give you an empty flour sack for a nickel. \nDARK ROOM \nWe hear wind whistling through cracks in the floorboards and walls. \nWe hear snoring. \nThere is one bed, not large, with two shapes in it. \nWe cut in closer to find Mattie lying on her back, staring. She shivers, shoulders hunched. The thin blanket barely covers her. \nShe pulls the blanket gently, slowly, so that it covers her exposed side. \nA beat of snoring, a snorfle, and then, as we hold on Mattie, the crackle of mattress ticking under a shifting body--and the blanket is pulled away toward the unseen snorer. \nCOURT HALLWAY \nVoices echo from inside the courtroom. Mattie cracks a heavy oak door and slips in. \nCOURTROOM \nThe gallery is crowded. Mattie is at the back of a press of standees. \nHer point-of-view, semi-obstructed: on the witness stand is Rooster Cogburn, a rough- hewn man going to middle-aged fat. He has a patch over one eye. \nCogburn The woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies on her face and the old man was inside with his breast blowed open by a scatter-gun and his feet burned. He was still alive but just was. He said them two Wharton boys had done it, rode up drunk-- \nMr. Goudy Objection. Hearsay. \nMr. Barlow Dying declaration, your honor. \nJudge Overruled. Procede, Mr. Cogburn. \nCogburn Them two Wharton boys--that'd be Odus and C.C.-- throwed down on him, asked him where his money was, when he wouldn't talk lit pine knots and held 'em to his feet. He told 'em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at one corner of the smokehouse. Mr. Barlow And then? \nCogburn Well he died on us. Passed away in considerable pain. \nMr. Barlow What did you do then? \nMr. Goudy How many members of this one family, the Wharton family, have you killed? \nCogburn Immediate, or-- \nMr. Barlow Your honor, perhaps counsel should be advised that the marshal is not the defendant in this action. Mr. Barlow The history is relevant your honor. Goes to Cogburn's methods and animosities. \nJudge Okay. \nMr. Barlow Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Clete Wharton, half-brother? \nCogburn Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee. He come at me with a king bolt. \nMr. Goudy You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but a king bolt? From a wagon tongue? \nCogburn I've seen men badly tore up with things no bigger than a king bolt. I defended myself. \nMr. Goudy And, returning to the encounter with Aaron and his two remaining sons, you sprang from cover with your revolver in hand? \nCogburn I did. \nMr. Goudy Loaded and cocked? \nCogburn If it ain't loaded and cocked it don't shoot. \nMr. Goudy And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man? \nCogburn He was armed. He had that axe raised. Mr. Goudy Yes. I believe you testified that you backed away from Aaron Wharton? \nCogburn That is right. \nMr. Goudy Which direction were you going? \nCogburn I always go backwards when I'm backing up. \nMr. Goudy Very amusing I suppose--for all of us except Aaron Wharton. Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner of Clete Wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled- up newspaper or whatever it was. \nCogburn Yes sir. He commenced to cussing and laying about with threats. \nMr. Goudy And you were backing away? How many steps before the shooting started? \nCogburn Seven, eight steps? \nMr. Goudy Aaron Wharton keeping pace, advancing, away from the fire seven eight steps--what would that be, fifteen, twenty feet? \nCogburn I suppose. \nMr. Goudy Will you explain to the jury, Mr. Cogburn, why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the fire, his sleeve and hand smoldering? \nCogburn Well. Mr. Goudy Did you move the body after you shot him? \nCogburn Why would I do that? \nMr. Goudy You did not drag his body over to the fire? Fling his arm in? \nCogburn No sir. \nMr. Goudy Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the location of the body. You do not remember moving the body? So it was a bushwack, as he tended his campfire? \nMr. Barlow Objection. \nCogburn I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him. I do not remember. \nMr. Goudy Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn? \nCogburn Them hogs rooting around might have moved him. I do not remember. \nCOURTHOUSE PORCH \nMattie waits as people file out. She pushes forward to meet Cogburn when he emerges, muttering. \nCogburn Son of a goddamn bitch. \nMattie Rooster Cogburn? \nCogburn What is it. \nHe does not look up from the cigarette he is trying to roll. His hands are shaking. \nMattie I would like to talk with you a minute. \nMattie I was as bad yesterday as you look today. I was forced to share a bed with Grandma Turner. \nThe trader's eyes are still on the paper: \nStonehill I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner. If she is a resident of this city it does not surprise me that she carries disease. I was told this malarial place was to be the Chicago of the Southwest. Well, my little friend, it is not the Chicago of the Southwest. I cannot rightly say what it is, but it has ruined my health as it has my finances. \nHe drops the paper. \n. . . I owe you money. \nHe works a key in a drawer and takes out money and counts during the following. \nMattie You have not traded poorly. \nStonehill Certainly not. I am paying you for a horse I do not possess and have bought back a string of useless ponies I cannot sell again. \nMattie You are forgetting the gray horse. \nStonehill Crowbait. \nMattie You are looking at the thing in the wrong light. \nStonehill I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth. \nHe hands the money across and Mattie counts to confirm. \nMattie Your illness is putting you \"down in the dumps.\" You will soon find a buyer for the ponies. \nStonehill I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head from the Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock. \nMattie It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh. \nStonehill So it would. I am confident the deal will fall through. \nMattie Look here. I need a pony. I will pay ten dollars for one of them. Stonehill No. That was lot price. No no. Wait a minute. Are we trading again? I just handed you twenty dollars each for those ponies and you now propose to buy one back for ten? Little girl: I will give you ten dollars to refrain from doing any more business here. It would be the most astute deal I have struck in Arkansas. \nSTABLE \nWe are tracking along a line of stalls toward a small corral holding a black mustang, among other ponies. \nMattie is approaching the horse. A black stablehand has been trailing her, humping her father's saddle. \nMattie This one is beautiful. \nShe rubs the muzzle of the black horse. \nShe takes the saddle from the stablehand and tries to throw it over the horse. She is not tall or strong enough. \nThe stableboy helps, then helps her up. \nThe horse does not move for a long beat. \nThe stableboy is laughing. \nStableboy He don't know they's a person up there. You too light. \nShe kicks lightly and the horse abruptly pitches once or twice and then starts prancing. \nThe stableboy, still laughing, stands in the middle of a circle defined by the prancing horse. \nStableboy He thinks he got a horsefly on him. \nMattie leans forward to calm the horse, rubbing the muzzle and shushing him. \nShe straightens. Mattie He is very spirited. I will call him \"Little Blackie.\" \nStableboy Das a good name. \nMattie What does he like for a treat? \nStableboy Ma'am, he is a horse, so he likes apples. \nShe reins the horse around and heads for the door, calling back: \nMattie Thank Mr. Stonehill for me. \nThe receding stableboy is uncomfortable. \nStableboy No ma'am. . . I ain't s'posed to utter your name. \nThe word detonates a fit of coughing. \n. . . You are not going. That is no part of it. \nMattie You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off. \nRooster I am a bonded U.S. marshal! \nMattie That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done. \nRooster You never said anything about this. I cannot go up against Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at the same time. \nMattie I am not a baby. \nRooster I will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds and plates of hot grub on the table. It will be traveling fast and eating light. What little sleeping is done will take place on the ground. \nMattie I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories. We had a good time. \nRooster Coon hunting! This ain't no coon hunt, it don't come within forty miles of being a coon hunt! \nMattie It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money. I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House. \nRooster stares, nonplussed. \nHe drops back into the rope bed, which sets it swaying. As he stares up at the ceiling: \nRooster Leave the money. Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt. \nGRANDMA TURNER'S ROOM \nMattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma Turner snores. She unrolls her father's traps and takes out a big-brimmed fisherman's hat and puts it on: too big. She lines it with newspaper, experimenting with the amount until it fits. She puts on his coat, gives the sleeves a big cuff. She examines the Colt's dragoon. She drops apples into a sack. \nShe finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope. Throughout, we have been hearing its contents in voice-over: \nMattie Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure. Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere Papa's death is avenged? My investigations in Fort Smith lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found and brought to justice, and I have made arrangements to that end. I will return to you once I have seen them properly carried through. . . \nEXTERIOR BOARDING HOUSE \nMattie is cinching her gear onto Little Blackie. She mounts and rides off as the letter ends: \nMattie But do not worry on my account. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. The author of all things watches over me. And I have a fine horse. Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek. I am off for the Choctaw Nation. \nINTERIOR GROCERY \nTracking toward Rooster's rope bed. A hat is pulled down over the face of the figure reclining in it. Smoke sifts up from somewhere. \nMattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern. She pulls the hat off. It is the elderly Chinese grocer. \nMattie Where is Marshal Cogburn! \nThe grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it. His manner is dreamy. \nGrocer Went away. . . \nMattie Away! Where? \nThe grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to Mattie. He closes his eyes and drifts away. \nMattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads: \nMattie Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn. \nMattie's jaw tightens. She abruptly crumples the paper. \nRIVER \nMattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width. At the near-side ferry station a raft enclosed by railing waits, its guide rope strung across the river. A pilot idles on the near shore. \nOn the far shore two small figures, mounted, ascend the opposite bank. Mattie draws up in front of the ferryman at the edge of the river. \nMattie Is that Marshal Cogburn? \nFerryman That is the man. \nMattie Who's he with? \nFerryman I do not know. \nMattie Take me across. \nHe begins to spank her. \nMattie Help me, Marshal! \nRooster sits impassively on his horse. \nLeBoeuf (still spanking) Now you do as the grown-ups say! Or I will get myself a birch switch and stripe your leg! \nMattie is struggling and in spite of herself starts to weep. LeBoeuf drags her through the dirt to a mesquite bush and snaps off a switch. \nLeBoeuf Now we will see what tune you sing! \nMattie, wet and filthy, tries vainly to swat back. Rooster still watches without expression as LeBoeuf whips the girl. \nMattie Are you going to let him do this, Marshal? \nFinally, quietly: \nRooster No, I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LeBoeuf. She has got the best of us. \nLeBoeuf looks back, for a moment too surprised to speak. He then regains his resolve: \nLeBoeuf She has not got the best of me! \nHe returns to the beating. \nRooster (evenly) Did you not hear me? That will do, I said. \nLeBoeuf I aim to finish what I started. \nRooster That will be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush-popper. \nThe sound of a gun being cocked. \nLeBoeuf leaves off the beating to stare at Rooster--whose gun is drawn, cocked, and pointed at him. \nLeBoeuf flings the switch aside and stalks to his horse. He mutters, but loud enough to be heard: \nLeBoeuf Hoorawed by a little girl. \nCAMPFIRE \nMattie sits looking into the fire, hands clasped around her knees. \nLeBoeuf sits feet to the fire, smoking a pipe that, with his boyish face, makes him look as if he is playing at professor. He gazes into the fire, musing as he pulls at the pipe. \nLeBoeuf I am not accustomed to so large a fire. In Texas, we will make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips to heat the night's ration of beans. \nRooster enters the circle of light with an armload of wood. \n. . . And, it is Ranger policy never to make your camp in the same place as your cookfire. Very imprudent to make your presence known in unsettled country. \nRooster gazes at LeBoeuf for a beat, then dumps the wood onto the fire. \nHe leaves the circle of light. \nLeBoeuf addresses the darkness that Rooster has disappeared into: \n. . . How do you know that Bagby will have intelligence? \nRooster He has a store. \nHe reenters with a length of rope, and a robe which he unrolls onto the ground. \nLeBoeuf A store. That makes him an authority on movements in the Territory? \nRooster plays out one end of the rope to just touch the ground, then starts playing out the rest as he paces. \nRooster We have entered a wild place. Anyone coming in, wanting any kind of supply, cannot pick and choose his portal. \nHe has finished making a loop around his sleeping robe. Seeing this, LeBoeuf laughs. \nLeBoeuf That is a piece of foolishness. All the snakes are asleep this time of year. \nAs he leaves the circle of light: \nRooster They have been known to wake up. \nMattie Let me have a rope too. \nLeBoeuf What's going on? \nRooster (testy) This is a business conversation. \nLeBoeuf Is that what you call it. It sounds to me like you are still being hoorawed by a little girl. \nRooster Did you say hooraw! \nLeBoeuf That was the word. \nRooster I will show you hooraw! \nMattie There is no hoorawing in it. My agreement with the Marshal antedates yours. It has the force of law. \nLeBoeuf (amused) The force of law! This man is a notorious thumper! He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson! \nRooster Those men was patriots, Texas trash! \nLeBoeuf They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas. \nRooster I have heard that too. It is a damned lie! What army was you in, mister? \nLeBoeuf I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith-- \nRooster What side was you on? \nLeBoeuf I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't have to hang my head when I say it! \nRooster If you had served with Captain Quantrill-- \nLeBoeuf Captain Quantrill indeed! \nRooster You had best let this go, LeBoeuf! \nLeBoeuf Captain of what! \nRooster Good, then! There are not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions, day and night. Our agreement is nullified--it's each man for himself! \nLeBoeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse. \nLeBoeuf That suits me! \nHe saws the horse around. \n. . . Congratulations, Cogburn. You have graduated from marauder to wetnurse. Adios! \nLeBoeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of spurs, and Rooster, seething, turns back to his work. \nAs the hoofbeats recede, Mattie sounds a note of regret: Mattie We don't need him, do we Marshal? \nRooster (muttering) We'll miss his Sharp's carbine. It's apt to get lively out here. \nEXTERIOR BAGBY'S STORE \nA mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is tied off to the porch of the ramshackle store. The beast is strangling as the rope is too tight, and he is being poked with sticks by two motley-dressed Indian boys up on the porch. \nRooster enters and cuts the rope. The mule brays and canters off, shaking its head, rope dangling. \nIndian Youth Hey. \nRooster is already mounting the steps to the porch. \nRooster Call that sport, do ya? \nHe kicks the first youth hard in the ass, sending him sprawling off the porch into the dirt. The second backs against the railing and Rooster shoves him in the chest so that he flips backward to also land in the dirt. \nRooster Stay here sister. I will see Bagby. \nMattie, astride Little Blackie, holds the reins of Cogburn's horse. As he disappears inside the two youths climb back onto the porch. They sit at the lip, feet dangling, and stare sullenly at Mattie. She stares back. \nMINUTES LATER \nThe youths have not moved. The door bangs open and Rooster emerges. \nMattie Has Chaney been here? Rooster No. \nCrossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the dirt again. The other youth scampers out of footreach. Rooster starts down the stairs. \nRooster But Coke Hayes was, two days ago. Coke runs with Lucky Ned. He bought supplies, with this. \nShe looks up, down again, and then proceeds. Rooster continues as well: \n. . . That was when I went out to the staked plains of Texas and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian called Olly. \nMattie stretches onto tiptoes, reaches, just gets fingers around a branch. She secures it enough with the one hand to dare to reach with the other. She hauls herself up. \n. . . The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake City but don't ask me what it was for. Call it a misunder- standing and let it go at that. There is no use in you asking me questions about it, for I will not answer them. \nMattie looks out, at waist-height to the corpse, which twists maybe eight feet away over the void. Rooster notes her look: \n. . . Is it our man? \nThe face is half-eaten and eyeless. Mattie I believe not. \nShe moves to start back down, but Rooster calls: \nRooster No! Cut him down! \nMattie Why? \nRooster I might know him. \nShe climbs one more branch to arrive at the hanging branch. She shimmies out onto it and pulls the knife from Rooster's belt now around her waist. \n. . . You see, Olly and me both taken a solemn oath to keep silent. Well sir, the big shaggies is about all gone. It is a damned shame. \nMattie looks down, over the shoulder of the close-by foreshortened corpse to the far foreshortened Rooster. \n. . . I would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo tongue. \nShe calls out as she starts sawing: \nMattie Why did they hang him so high? \nRooster I don't know. Possibly in the belief it would make him more dead. \nThe sawing continues. \nRooster takes one step back. \nThe rope snaps. At once: \nThe body drops. \nThe branch, unburdened, bucks with Mattie atop it. \nShe gasps, hugging at the branch, getting swung halfway around it but then righting herself. \nThe body hits the ground with a smack. \nMattie looks. \nThe body is spread out on the ground below, many bones now broken, its posture absurd. \nRooster steps forward. He toes the upper body to get a view of the face. Barely audible: \nRooster I do not know this man. \nHe reacts to something, looking up the road in the direction of their heading. \nMattie looks out. Partly obscured by intervening foliage, an oncoming rider. His pace is unhurried. \nDown on the ground Rooster turns to face the rider--an Indian with a long-bore rifle balanced sideways across the pommel of his saddle. He wears a tattered Union Army jacket, crossed bandoliers of rifle shells and a black homburg hat with a feather in its brim. \nRooster drops his hand to his gun as the rider approaches. \nMattie looks down at the foreshortened rider pulling up under the tree. She hears a greeting and a mostly inaudible exchange. \nAfter some back-and-forth the Indian dismounts. The men stoop at either end of the corpse. Rooster grabs wrists, the Indian, ankles. They lift. \nMattie frowns. She starts to move. \nA MINUTE LATER \nMattie finishes climbing down. \nRooster is just returning from the road to their two horses by the tree. The Indian, with the corpse slung over the rump of his horse, is resuming his trip in the direction from which Rooster and Mattie came. \nMattie He knew the hanged man? \nAs Mattie descends to where hillside meets structure Rooster takes his rifle and walks around to the front door--crude planking hung on leather-strap hinges. His footsteps crunch in the snow. \nThe door is yanked open, inches, and a backlit face appears over a hand holding a revolver. Rooster halts. \nMan Who is out there? \nRooster We are looking for shelter. \nMan No room for you here! Ride on! \nThe door slams. \nAfter a moment the light inside goes out. \nMattie, arriving on the roof, looks steeply down on Rooster. He glances up, thinking. He does not sign. He looks back at the door. \nRooster Who all is in there? \nVoice Ride on! \nRooster looks up at Mattie. He nods. \nShe balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney. \nRooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels in the snow, raising his rifle. \nLong beat. \nMuffled coughs from inside the house--more than one person. \nActivity inside--yelling--the hiss of fire being doused. Suddenly: \nThe door flies open and--BANG! BANG!--two shotgun blasts. Slightest beat as Mattie peers into the yard, and then--BANG!--shot rips through the roof just at her feet. \nA rifle blast--from Rooster. A yelp of pain from inside. \nRooster I am a Federal officer! Who is in there? Speak up and be quick about it. \nNew Voice A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch! \nRooster cocks his head. \nRooster Is that Emmett Quincy? \nNew Voice I don't know any Emmett Quincy. \nRooster Listen here, Emmett Quincy. I know it is you! This is Rooster Cogburn. Columbus Potter and five other marshals is out here with me. We have got a bucket of coal oil. In one minute we will burn you out from both ends! Chuck your arms clear and come out with your hands locked on your head and you will not be harmed. Oncet that coal oil goes down the chimney we are killing everything that comes out the door! \nThinking beat. \nQuincy There's only two of you! \nRooster You go ahead and bet your life on it! How many of you is in there? \nQuincy Me and Moon, but he is hit! He can't walk! \nRooster Drag him out! Light that lamp! Thinking beat. \nQuincy Tell them other officers to be careful with their guns! We are coming out! \nThe door opens again. From the smoky black a shotgun and two revolvers are tossed out. Then, orange light: a lamp is lit. Two men emerge, one limping and holding onto the other, who holds high the lamp. \nRooster Down in the snow! Lie still while I cuff you! We is only two, but my man on the roof will shoot you if you get feisty. \nINSIDE \nRooster has coaxed the fire back to life. He peers into the large pot hanging over it. \nThe cuffed men sit side-by-side on a plank bench behind a plank table, staring at Mattie. Moon's leg is bound with a large blue handkerchief. \nQuincy sounds resentful: \nQuincy You said it was a man on the roof. I thought it was Potter. \nRooster You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form. \nHe stirs the pot with a wooden spoon. \n. . .This here's an awful lot of sofky. Was you boys looking for company? \nMoon We seen Ned and Haze two days ago. We's supposed-- \nQuincy Don't act the fool! If you blow I will kill you! \nMoon I am played out. I must have a doctor. We's supposed-- \nQuincy jerks up one knee, banging the bottom of the table and sloshing Rooster's sofky as he grabs something from his boot: a knife. \nHe slams it down on Moon's cuffed hand, chopping off four fingers. They fly like chips from a log. \nAs Moon screams Rooster mutters: \nRooster God damn it! \nQuincy flips the knife lightly in the air and regrabs it with blade pointing opposite-wise. He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest. \nRooster has his gun out now and fires. \nQuincy jerks back, hit in the face. Blood spatters Mattie. Quincy, still seated, slides awkwardly down the wall. \nMoon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest. \nMoon Oh lord, I am dying! \nRooster and Mattie stand over him. \n. . . Do something! Help me! \nRooster I can do nothing for you, son. Your pard has killed you and I have done for him. \nMoon Don't leave me lying here! Don't let the wolves rip me up! \nRooster I'll see you are buried right. You tell me about Ned. Where did you see him? \nMoon Two days ago at McAlester's store. They are coming here tonight to get remounts, and sofky. They just robbed the Katy Flyer at Wagoner's Switch if the snow didn't stop 'em. \nEyes wide, he gazes down his body. \n. . . I am bleeding buckets! I am gone. Send the news to my brother, George Garrett. He is a Methodist circuit rider in South Texas. You can write care of the district supervisor in Austin. \nRooster Should I tell him you was outlawed up? \nMoon It don't matter, he knows I am on the scout. I will meet him later walking the streets of Glory! \nRooster Don't be looking for Quincy. \nOUTSIDE \nMattie's point-of-view: the dark shoulders of the wooded hills, funneling down to the ravine. It is all very still except for falling snow. \nMattie stands outside the cabin door, hugging herself, keeping watch. \nThe door opens and Rooster emerges. \nRooster Hobble our mounts in the corral out back. We don't know when they's coming. \nFrom the threshold he surveys the inside of the cabin. \nMattie Is he dead? \nRooster He is. I stowed the bodies under the blanket there. Just needs to look right enough to get 'em in the door. \nSomething he sees inside prompts Rooster to quickly reenter the cabin. He reemerges, fist closed on something. \n. . . We'll climb that ridge there, fort up somewhere gives us a clear shot. \nHe flings, and whatever he was holding lands faintly pit-a-pat in the woods. \nMattie What was that? \nRooster Fingers. \nRIDGE \nRooster finishes hunkering down. \nHe takes out his revolver and put a cartridge into the one empty chamber, under the hammer. He places the revolver on a log and puts the sack of cartridges next to the revolver. He leans his rifle against the log. He looks out. \nHis point-of-view of the cabin below, peaceful, smoke drifting from the chimney. \nMattie What do we do, Marshal? \nRooster We sit. What does he do? \nThe riders stop several paces from LeBoeuf. They spread in a line facing him. Words are exchanged; we cannot make them out. \nLeBoeuf unholsters a gun and points it at the four men. \nRooster He is a fine one for not drawing attention to himself. \nThe four men, slouched astride their horses, are not impressed by LeBoeuf's gun. There is more talking. \nRooster Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned. \nHe refers to the mounted man who does most of the talking. Lucky Ned now speaks to the men on either side and the two corners advance, closing a circle around LeBoeuf. \nLeBoeuf looks warily from side side, swinging his gun to cover the group. None of the riders bothers to unholster a gun. \nThe man to LeBoeuf's right lifts a rope off his saddle and casually twirls it. \nThe man to his left says something: LeBoeuf looks left and the man to his right drops the rope around LeBoeuf and pulls it tight. LeBoeuf is jerked off his feet, gun dropping. The mounted man backs his horse, taking the play from the rope. He dallies the free end round his saddlehorn. \nTwo of the men slide off their horses. \nOne of them heads for the cabin door. \nRooster Well, that's that. \nBANG!--the rifleshot, just at Mattie's ear, is deafening. \nThe man heading to the cabin drops, shot in the back. \nThe two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked. \nThe horse towing LeBoeuf also skitters, spooked, as its rider looks wildly about and starts shooting. \nLucky Ned looks toward our vantage point and also begins firing. \nRooster is methodically aiming and firing but in the commotion below his first couple of shots don't tell. His third drops Lucky Ned's horse. \nThe other unmounted man is frantically trying to snatch up the reins of one of the loose horses. \nThe man towing LeBoeuf spurs his horse toward one of the free horses, trying to grab it. LeBoeuf is dragged past plunging horses' hooves. \nA cacaphony of screaming horses, crackling gunfire from the basin, and the boom of Rooster's rifle. \nThe unmounted man has managed to grab a halter. He climbs with difficulty aboard the skittish horse. \nThe rider towing LeBoeuf cuts loose the towline. He gallops toward Ned Pepper with an arm outstretched to help him aboard. \nRooster is tracking him with his rifle. \nLucky Ned grabs the extended arm. As he begins to swing up there is the BOOM of Rooster's rifle. The rider pitches off the horse but Lucky Ned manages to stay on, and swipes up the reins. He gallops off. \nThe one other surviving horseman follows him. \nThere is one dead horse in the basin, a live unmounted horse racing crazy circles, and three still bodies. One is LeBoeuf's. \nRooster rises. \nRooster Well that didn't pan out. \nIN THE BASIN \nLeBoeuf is moaning. \nRooster walks toward him trailed by Mattie, glancing along the way at the two dead men. \nRooster You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner. \nLeBoeuf I am theverely injured. \nSomething is wrong with LeBoeuf's speech. Bloody saliva bubbles copiously from his mouth. \nRooster Yes you got drug some. \nLeBoeuf Altho shshot. By a rifle. \nRooster stoops to examine. \n. . . You will not go with me? \nChaney I think not. It is just the other way around. You are going with me. I will-- \nMattie fires. \nChaney, shocked, takes a staggering step back. \nMattie stumbles and falls back under the recoil, into the stream but careful to hold the gun high and dry. She awkwardly reclaims her footing and retrains the gun. Chaney is looking down at his bleeding side. \nChaney I did not think you would do it. \nMattie What do you think now? \nChaney One of my short ribs is broken. It hurts jiggers every breath I take. \nMattie You killed my father when he was trying to help you. I have one of the gold pieces you took from him. Now give me the other. \nShe is struck by a worrying thought. She hastily recocks the gun. \nChaney I regret that shooting. Mr. Ross was decent to me but he ought not to have meddled in my business. \nCrashing from the brush up the hill, and a voice: \nRooster Mattie! \nMattie I am down here! Chaney is taken into custody! \nChaney I was drinking and I was mad through and through. Nothing has gone right for me. \nThere is yelling from the other bank now too. Mattie No, you are just a piece of trash, that is all. \nChaney Everything is against me. Now I am shot by a child. \nHe sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him. \nMattie Stop! \nShe squeezes the trigger, but the gun dry fires. \nChaney grabs the gun and flings it away, then holds on to Mattie and slaps her. \nMattie Help me! Down here! Hurry up! \nTwo men burst through the brush from Chaney's side of the river. One is in woolly chaps --Lucky Ned Pepper. The other is taller and dressed almost formally in a linen suit and string tie and a bear coat. Both men bear Winchester repeating rifles. \nChaney is dragging Mattie to their bank, slapping at her along the way. \nRooster emerges from his side of the riverbank carrying a side arm. \nThe men exchange fire. \nLucky Ned (to Chaney) Take them horses you got and move! \nHe grabs Mattie from Chaney and keeps her between himself and the far bank as he fires again. \nOne hand to his bleeding side, Chaney lunges for the horses' leads. \nRooster has retreated back to the tree cover, as has the well dressed man on our side. Intermittent gunshots and the panicked neighing of horses. Lucky Ned falls back into the trees with Mattie and starts pulling her up the steep hill. \nChaney follows pulling the string of horses. He is breathing hard and blood stains the front of his shirt. Lucky Ned (to Chaney) Get on up that hill! Don't you stop. \nHe twists Mattie around to face him and we see him clearly for the first time. Part of his upper lip and three of his front teeth are missing. \n. . . Who all is down there? \nMattie Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers. \nLucky Ned throws Mattie to the ground. He puts a muddy boot on her neck. \nLucky Ned Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in! \nMattie manages to choke out: \nMattie Just the marshal. \nLucky Ned Cogburn! Do you hear me? \nSilence. \nMattie No you won't. This man will not let you have your way. He is your boss and you must do as he tells you. \nChaney turns to Lucky Ned who has a spyglass to his eye, scanning a ridge across the river. \nChaney Five minutes is well up! \nLucky Ned speaks quietly, without lowering the glass: \nLucky Ned I will give him a little more time. \nFrom somewhere in the woods below we hear the idiot's gobbling noises. \nChaney How much more? \nLucky Ned Til I think he has had enough. \nThe voice of the well dressed man floats up from the woods: \nWell Dressed Man He is gone, Ned! I can see nothing! We had best make a move! \nLucky Ned Hold fast a while there, Doctor! \nMattie looks at Chaney moaning in pain as the ex-soldier works on his side. \nMattie Why doesn't the Doctor do that? \nLucky Ned replies absently, still gazing out: \nLucky Ned He is not a medical doctor. Was that Rooster waylaid us night before last? \nMattie It was Marshal Cogburn and myself. \nLucky Ned Yourself, eh? You and Cogburn, quite the posse. \nHe sees something and hastily raises the glass. \nA horseman is ascending the treeless ridge across the river with a riderless horse--Little Blackie--in tow. At the top he pauses and turns, and draws a revolver from his saddle and points it skyward. We see the gun kick and breathe gunsmoke. A second later we hear the shot. Lucky Ned lowers the glass and takes a gun and shoots skyward. He raises the glass again. \nThe horseman turns away and proceeds on over the crest. He is gone. \nLucky Ned turns to Mattie. He comes and squats at the fire. \nLucky Ned Your friend is gone. You are alone. \nThe well dressed man and the idiot trudge up from the woods onto the rock ledge. \nThe man in the dirty uniform continues to perform crude field surgery on Chaney, digging into his side with a knife to extract the bullet. As Chaney moans the idiot makes calf- bawling noises in imitation. \nWell Dressed Man We must move, Ned. \nLucky Ned You are too nervous, Doctor. It will be hours before he is back with help. \nLucky Ned turns back to Mattie. \n. . . What happened to Quincy, and The Kid? \nMattie They are both dead. I was in the very middle of it. It was a terrible thing to see. Do you need a good lawyer? \nLucky Ned I need a good judge. What about Coke Hayes--the old fellow shot off his horse? \nMattie Dead as well. His depredations have come to an end. \nLucky Ned Poor Coke. He rode back for me. Coke Hayes had spine, and could keep his wits in a tight spot. Dead now, but he should have been dead ten times afore now. Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners. Mattie He is not my friend. He has abandoned me to a congress of louts. \nLucky Ned You do not varnish your opinions. \nWell Dressed Man Are we staying here for chat? \nThe idiot is still bawling. Chaney grabs a stone and flings it at him and the idiot scampers back, making goat noises. Chaney grabs, moaning, at the wound aggravated by this fresh exertion. \nThe man in officer's boards laughs. \nSoldier Do an owl, Harold! \nIdiot Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! \nChaney Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer. \nLucky Ned straightens from the fire and begins to collect his meager belongings. The other men follow suit. \nHe swats her with his free hand. Her clawing stops. \nChaney is wincing from the swing of his own arm. As he leans over her his opened wound dribbles blood onto Mattie along with his sweat. \n. . . In honesty, I do not regret shooting him. He thought Tom Chaney was small. Lucky Ned thinks the same. And you would give me an affidavit. \nHe reaches back awkwardly toward his calf with his bad hand, groaning with the stretch. We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath. \n. . . You are all against me. Everything is against me. \nHe pushes against the underside of Mattie's chin, stretching her neck. \nHer eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension. \n. . . But here at least I have matters in hand, and once I have done for you-- \nWhack--a rifle stock swings into frame, connecting with Chaney's head. His head snaps to one side and then lolls back as he slowly straightens, ropey drool and blood pouring from his mouth. He sways briefly and then collapses onto Mattie. \nA hand enters to pull him off. Mattie blearily props herself on her elbows. \nLeBoeuf is panting and sweating from his climb. He gazes down at Chaney. Once he has breath: \nLeBoeuf Sho that ish Chelmthford. Shtrange to be sho closhe at lasht. \nMattie How is it you are here? \nLeBoeuf's look breaks from Chaney. He pulls his pipe from his pocket and lights it. \nLeBoeuf I heard the shotsh and went down to the river. . . \nHe crosses the rock ledge. \n. . . Cogburn outlined a plan. Hizh part, I fear, izh rash. (reacts to hole) But that izh a pit there! Mind your footing. \nHe skirts the large hole and reaches the shelf's far lip and gazes out. Before him is a steep drop-off. We see the very crowns of near pines and then, four hundred yards away, the land flattening to an open meadow. \nMattie, also gazing out, comes up beside LeBoeuf. \nMattie A plan? \nLeBoeuf points with his pipe. \nLeBoeuf He returnzh for Lucky Ned. \nLucky Ned, the Parmalees, and the Doctor are just entering the low meadow, riding away. As they do so Rooster enters at the far side, facing. He draws one of his navy sixes as he advances. \nMattie One against four. It is ill advised. \nLeboeuf shrugs. \nLeBoeuf He would not be dishuaded. \nHe and Mattie both watch as, below, the parties advance on each other at a walk. Eighty yards separating them, they halt. \nTHE MEADOW \nRooster and Lucky Ned eye each other. After a beat: \nLucky Ned Well, Rooster, will you give us the road? \nIdiot Moo! Moo! \nRooster Hello, Ned. How many men are with the girl? \nLucky Ned Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force: she was in excellent health when last I saw her. \nRooster nods. \nA beat. \nRooster Farrel, I want you and your brother to stand clear. You as well, Doctor. I have no interest in you today. \nLucky Ned What is your intention, Rooster? Do you think one on four is a dogfall? \nRooster I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned. Or see you hanged in Fort Smith at Judge Parker's convenience. Which will you have? \nNed Pepper laughs. \nLucky Ned I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man! \nMattie screams. \nLeBoeuf has collapsed and is motionless. Chaney drops the rock and stoops for the rifle. \nMattie is already dragging it away. She grabs it up. \nMattie Stand up, Tom Chaney! \nChaney stands nearly straight--as much as his injuries will allow, and-- \nBoom!--the blast catches Chaney in the chest and he is blown back off the ledge, looking surprised. He falls to oblivion. \nBut the carbine recoil pushes Mattie stumbling back and this, with the bad footing at the lip of the pit behind her, sends her falling. \nPIT \nMattie is tumbling. She bounces down a very steep slope, disturbed earth tumbling with her, protruding roots and slender upgrowing foliage slapping at her on her descent. \nAs she descends more or less feet-first something snags an ankle and her inertia sends her upper body on down past the pinned leg. She jerks to a halt head-downmost on the steep slope. \nThe patter of falling dirt subsides. Silence. Heavy breathing. \nMattie, lying face-up, does a painful half sit-up to look around. \nAbove her, her left foot is snarled through some roots. Well beyond, very high, weak light defines the mouth of the pit. \nUsing her elbows she pivots, scooting her upper body uphill so that she is no longer below her foot. She reaches the cuff of her pants on the trapped leg and pulls it up to expose the shin. \nA splinter of broken bone has punctured the skin. \nShe pulls the cuff back down. \nShe stretches to slip fingers between her boot and the roots in which it is fouled. She just manages to work in two fingers; in wrenching around, the root has cinched tight. She tugs feebly at the root, which shows no signs of give. \nShe looks back up. \nThe small hole of weak daylight, dust drifting up toward it. \nMattie Mr. LeBoeuf! Are you alive! \nNo answer. \n. . . Mr. LeBoeuf! \nArms tiring, she lays back again against earth. She looks around. \nPartway round the pit, just at her level, something difficult to discern in the semi-dark: two mirroring shapes, close to each other: is it the soles of a pair of boots? \nMattie squints. She props herself partway up. \nHigher view: they are boots--worn by a corpse--stretching away from us, foreshortened. The man's skull has been partly shattered by the protruding rock against which it rests. \nMattie surveys the body. Her attention is caught by something: \nThe skeletal remains are still clothed and there seems to be something held by a bandolier strapped across the chest, over the body's decomposing blue shirt but beneath a tattered vest. A sheath is just visible high on the strap, near the corpse's shoulder. The butt-end of a knife juts out. \nMattie stretches, reaching. \nShe can just get to a boot. \nShe pulls. \nThe man's remains seem to be fairly light. They drag across earth, raising dust, tending to slide away with the grade of the pit. \nMattie reels the body in, careful not to let go and lose it down the hill. She pulls shoe, pants cuff, pants knee, belt. The bandolier is close. \nHer fingers curl around shirt, and pull. \nThe shirt's buttons softly pop and fiber dust drifts up as the fabric falls to pieces. Rib cage is exposed beneath. \nMattie hastily reaches and curls fingers around ribs. She pulls. She is about to get the knife when-- \nA glistening something inside the rib cage--guts?--starts to slowly move. But it can't be guts: it is gliding, coiling, under its own power. \nA faint rattle. \nMattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens. One snake starts to slowly emerge, and she bats the body away. \nShe pushes and kicks with her free leg, as much as her pinned attitude will allow. The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark. It disappears. Fiber and bone dust float up toward us. We hear rattles. Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body. The root holds fast. \nRooster I must get you to a doctor, sis, or you are not going to make it. (to LeBoeuf) The girl is snakebit. We are off. \nHe swings up behind her and nods down to LeBoeuf. \n. . . I am in your debt for that shot, pard. \nLeBoeuf Never doubt the Texash Ranger. \nRooster reins the horse around and spurs it. LeBouef shouts after: \n. . . Ever shtalwart! \nThe horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly, with stiff legs, Rooster kicking it on. Tree branches slap at him and take his hat. His face, already peppered with shot, gets new scratches. \nTHE MEADOW \nMattie is woozy. As Little Blackie crosses the field at full gallop Mattie looks blearily at the littering bodies of horses and men. \nNext to Lucky Ned's body his horse, saddled and riderless, swings its head to watch as Rooster and Mattie pass. \nMattie's eyes are closing. \nLATE DAY \nMattie's eyes half-open. \nLittle Blackie plunges on, through a rough road in woods, but slower now, his mouth foaming. \nRooster Come on, you! \nMattie We must stop. Little Blackie is played out. \nHorrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: \nRooster We have miles yet. \nHe leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife. He leans back and slashes at the horse's whithers. Little Blackie surges. \nMattie screams. \nMattie No! \nA locked-down shot as horse and riders enter at a gallop and recede. \nNIGHT \nIt has started to snow. \nMattie is flushed and soaked with sweat. \nThe horse is laboring for breath. \nRooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on. \nMattie looks ahead: \nBarely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on ahead. A sash cord holds a rifle to his back. \nHe recedes, outpacing us, disappearing into the darkness and the falling snow. \nMattie He is getting away. \nRooster Who is getting away? \nMattie Chaney. \nRooster Hold on, sis. \nMattie is falling. It is unclear why. \nHer legs squeeze the horses flanks. \nHer hand tightens on the horses mane. \nRooster's arm reaches around to hold her. \nLittle Blackie is giving out, going to his knees and then all the way down. \nRooster hangs on to Mattie as the horse sinks. He pulls her clear, lays her on the ground, and then steps away from her, taking out a gun. \n", "test1_input": "Mattie squints at him against the daylight: \nThe man has a cowlick and barndoor ears and is once again well-accoutered for riding. He steps away from the window and reseats himself. \nCowboy You do not look well. My name is LeBoeuf. I have just come from Yell County. \nMattie We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County. \nLeBoeuf A saucy line will not get you far with me. I saw your mother yesterday morning. She says for you to come right on home. \nMattie Hm. What was your business there? \nLeBoeuf takes a small photograph from his coat. \nLeBoeuf This is a man I think you know. \nMattie looks at the picture through red-rimmed eyes. \n. . . You called him Tom Chaney, I believe. . . \nMattie declines to contradict. LeBoeuf continues: \n. . . though in the months I have been tracking him he has used the names Theron Chelmsford, John Todd Andersen, and others. He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas before turning up at your father's place. \nMattie Why did you not catch him in Monroe, Louisiana or Pine Bluff, Arkansas? LeBoeuf He is a crafty one. \nMattie I thought him slow-witted myself. \nLeBoeuf That was his act. \nMattie It was a good one. Are you some kind of law? \nLeBoeuf tips back in his chair and draws back his coat to display a star. A smug look. \nLeBoeuf That's right. I am a Texas Ranger. \nMattie That may make you a big noise in that state; in Arkansas you should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make you an object of fun. Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney? \nLeBoeuf's smile stays in place with effort. \nLeBoeuf He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in Waco, Texas. The Bibbs family have put out a reward. \nMattie How came Chaney to shoot a state senator? \nLeBoeuf My understanding is there was an argument about a dog. Do you know anything about where Chaney has gone? \nMattie He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you earning your bounty. \nLeBoeuf Why is that? \nMattie My man will beat you to it. I have hired a deputy marshal, the toughest one they have, and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang that they say Chaney has tied up with. \nLeBoeuf Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal. \nMattie No. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine. \nLeBoeuf It'll be to our mutual advantage. Your marshal I presume knows the Territory; I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man job taking him alive. \nMattie When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to hang. I am not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting some senator. \nLeBoeuf Haw-haw! It is not important where he hangs, is it? \nMattie It is to me. Is it to you? \nLeBoeuf It means a great deal of money to me. It's been many months' work. \nMattie I'm sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages, and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine. \nLeBoeuf stands. \nLeBoeuf You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements. While I sat there watching you I gave some thought to stealing a kiss, though you are very young and sick and unattractive to boot, but now I have a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt. \nMattie rolls away onto her side. Mattie One would be as unpleasant as the other. If you wet your comb, it might tame that cowlick. \nHer eyelids droop. \nSpurs jingle and fade away. \nDistant voices from the street. Clanging church bell. Very close, the clink of bottle against cup. \n", "test1_true": "The landlady has materialized at the side of the bed. She is pouring something from a bottle into a ceramic cup. \nLandlady Try some Dr. Underwood's. You may feel giddy but do not be alarmed as that is only the medicine working. \nMattie obediently rises to an elbow, drinks, then drops back onto the pillow. A clunk: \nThe landlady has set the bottle down on the nightstand. \nMattie squints at the bottle: \nDr. Underwood's Bile Activator Approved by Physicians and Clergymen \nThe room's shadows grow longer still and crawl up the bottle. \nThe voice of the unseen landlady echoes and trails away: \nLandlady I will charge you ten cents. It probably means a loss for me, but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of the bottle. . . \nFrom outside, the sound of a horse approaching at a gallop. \nWe cut outside. It is snowing, and night again. \nFrank Ross's body is once again in the street before the boarding house. \nThe bareback horseman enters frame and recedes, rifle tied to his back. A saddled horse stands in the middle of the street, pointed at the receding Tom Chaney. \nChaney disappears down the dark street into the falling snow. \nSmall hands reach up and wrap the saddlehorn on the waiting horse. \nMattie's face appears over the saddle as she tries to pull herself up. \nClose on her feet rising from the ground, then pedaling, seeking purchase. There are no stirrups. \nClose on Mattie again. Sweating, she succeeds in chinning and elbowing herself onto the horse's back. The sound of the fleeing horseman has receded almost to nothing. \nShe gets herself arranged in the saddle. She looks down for the reins. \nThe reins hang down from the bit. \nShe lies forward onto the horse's neck, a fistful of mane in one hand, reaching with the other. . . reaching down. . . her fingers curl around the reins. . . she pulls. \nThe horse tosses its head and rears. \nMattie's legs squeeze the horses flanks. \nHer fingers tighten on the horses mane but she is slipping, falling. . . \nIn the boarding house bedroom Mattie's hands clutch at pillow. \nIt is dark. \nA phlegm-hawking sound. \nA woman in a nightgown, face obscured by sleeping bonnet, approaches the bed and disappears around its far side. \nThe sound of the old woman climbing into bed and settling. \nAfter a beat, the covers are yanked from Mattie. \nAfter another beat--snoring. \nPOST OFFICE The door bangs open at the cut and Mattie emerges with an envelope. \nIt is day. \nSTREET \nMattie walks down the street holding the ripped-open envelope in one hand and some unfolded papers in the other, the topmost of which she reads as she walks. \nWe hear the letter's contents in a gruff male voice-over: \nLetter Mattie. I wish you would leave these matters entirely to me, or at the very least do me the courtesy of consulting me before entering such agreements. I am not scolding you, but I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight corner one day. I trust the enclosed document will let you conclude your business and return to Dardanelle. Your mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you back home. Yours, J. Noble Dagget. \nPAPERS \nThrust onto a desk. \nWider shows that we are once again in the office of Stonehill, the stock trader. He examines the release through bleary eyes, displaying none of his former vinegar. \n", "test1_id": 225, "test2_input": "We hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck, and a wet breath. \nRooster . . . You could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun was resting on Gibraltar. \nLeBoeuf The Sharp'sh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power and precizhun. \nRooster I have no doubt that the gun is sound. \nSilence. \nLeBoeuf shrugs. \nMORNING \nWide: three riders leave the cabin single-file. \nJump in: pushing Mattie, who rides last in line. LeBoeuf is in front of her. Rooster leads, head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle. \nHe then half-hums, half-scats a tune. \nMattie twists to look behind. \nHer point-of-view: pulling away from the cabin, against the wall of which the four dead men are now semi-drifted over with snow. Rooster's humming has stopped and we hear his voice: \nRooster That was \"Johnny in the Low Ground.\" There are very few fiddle tunes I have not heard. Once heard they are locked in my mind forever. It is a sadness to me that I have sausage fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--little fat girls at a cotillion. \"Soldier's Joy\"! \nHe launches into another song, interrupted by the slosh of liquid as he takes a drink. Mattie looks forward again and LeBoeuf turns to look back at her. He keeps his voice low: \nLeBoeuf I don't believe he shlept. \nStill without looking back, Rooster projects: \nRooster Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf, but I would encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here a one-armed man looks like easy prey. \nLeBoeuf And a one-eyed man--who can't shshoodt? Why don't you tshurn back, Khoghburn? \nRooster I will do fine. \nHe twists around to gaily hector LeBoeuf: \n. . . I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I am uninjured, I am provisioned--and we agreed to separate. \nLeBoeuf In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement. You are the pershon who shshot me. \nMattie Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal. It is an unfair leg-up in any competition to shoot your opposite number. \nRooster God damn it! I don't accept it as a given that I did shoot LeBoeuf. There was plenty of guns going off. \nLeBoeuf I heard a rifle and felt the ball. You mishshed your shshodt, Khoghburn, admit it. You are more handicapped without the eye than I without the arm. \nRooster Missed my shot! I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards! \nHe reins his horse up, hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to make sure it is empty, and then hurls it high. \nHe pulls out a navy six-gun and fires. \nThe bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched, and drops. \nRooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces distant. He shoots again and misses. He shoots a third time and the bottle shatters. \nRooster The chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again. \nLeBoeuf I tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in your eyezh. That izh to shay, your eye. \nRooster starts to dismount, finishing in a semi-controlled fall. He dusts one knee and reaches into his saddlebag. He pulls out a corn dodger and heaves it up. \nHe fires. The corn dodger is obliterated. \nHe reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag. \nRooster Two at one time! \nHe hurls them and quickly fires twice. Nothing happens; he quickly fires three times at the falling corn dodgers, missing. \nScowling, he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his gun when another gun goes off, making him jump. \nLeBoeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand, missing. \nRooster I will chunk one high. Hold fire. \n", "test2_true": "LeBoeuf There. \nRooster There?! My bullet! \nLeBoeuf Your bullet? If you hit what you aim at, eckshplain my shoulder! \nMattie Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang. \nRooster One more, this will prove it. Hold fire! \nHe tosses a corn dodger and fires. It holds to its arc and falls. LeBoeuf is smug. \nLeBoeuf Azh I shed, Khoghburn. \nRooster roars: \nRooster Did you not see the piece fly off?! \nRIDING \nSome time later. \nRooster sways in the saddle, holding a bottle, humming. \nHe tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back, confirming that this one too is now empty. \nRiding forward, he leans out of the saddle, stretching low to one side, his hand extended with the bottle. Wavering, he places it upon a large rock as he passes. \nHis arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his place on the horse. He half- turns, propping himself with one hand on his saddle-back, to address Mattie and LeBoeuf: \nRooster Find our way back! \nSKY \nFramed by a mine entrance. \nRooster steps into the square, wood-beam frame of the entrance, looking in. \nA beat, and he pulls out his six-gun and fires in. \nEchoing ricochets. \nWide outside: Rooster before the entrance; Mattie and LeBoeuf standing close by. Very still. \nThe little camp is deserted. \nRooster turns to pan the hills. \nAt length: \nRooster Lucky Ned! \nVery faint echo. \nFaintly, from our distant perspective: \nLeBoeuf Very good, Khoghburn. Now what. \nCRACKLING CAMPFIRE \nIt is raining. \nThe campfire is roughly canopied by a hide draped at a cant over a pair of tree branches. \nMattie pours hot water from a kettle into a large tin cup holding a corn dodger. She takes a fork and starts mashing the dodger into mush. \nLeBoeuf sits before the fire, coat over his head, one hand on his jaw, which is swollen. \nLeBoeuf Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store. \nMattie That is silly. You have not eaten the whole day, and it is my store not his. \nRooster Let him starve! \nRooster, bellicose, stumbles to the fire with a few thin branches. As he leans in toward the fire the water draining off the low edge of the canopy drums onto his neck. He waves a hand back at it like a man swatting flies. Rooster He does not track! He does not shoot--except at foodstuffs!-- \nLeBoeuf That wazh your idea. \nRooster --He does not contribute! He is a millstone, with opinions! He is a man who walks in front of bullets! \n", "test2_id": 226, "test3_input": "Rooster sits heavily, a stretching leg kicking away an empty bottle. Rain patters on his hat. \n. . . He is a drag-brake for horses! \nMattie Mr. LeBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned Pepper Gang while we fired safely from cover, like a band of sly Injuns! \nRooster We? \nMattie It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his own defense! \nLeBoeuf I can thpeak for mythelf. I am hardly obliged to anther the ravingth of a drunkard. It ith beneath me. \nHe rises and starts gathering his things. \n. . . I shall make my own camp elthwhere. It ith you who have nothing to offer, Khoghburn. A shad picture indeed. Thish izh no longer a manhunt, it izh a debauch. The Texath Ranger preththeth on alone. \nRooster Take the girl! I bow out! \nLeBoeuf A fine thing to deshide once you have brought her into the middle of the Choctaw Nation. Rooster I bow out! I wash my hands! \nMattie Gentlemen, we cannot fall out in this fashion, so close to our goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand! \nRooster erupts: \nRooster In hand?! If he is not in a shallow grave, somewhere between here and Fort Smith, he is gone! Long gone! Thanks to Mr. LeBoeuf, we missed our shot! We have barked, and the birds have flown! Gone gone gone! Lucky Ned and his cohort, gone! Your fifty dollars, gone! Gone the whiskey seized in evidence! The trail is cold, if ever there was one! I am a foolish old man who has been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers--and a nincompoop! Well, Mr. LeBoeuf can wander the Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes; perhaps the local Indians will take him in and honor his gibberings by making him Chief! You, sister, may go where you like! I return home! Our engagement is terminated! I bow out! \nHe whips his robe over himself. \nMINUTES LATER \nWide on Mattie, staggering toward us carrying a saddle. We boom down to bring Little Blackie into the foreground as Mattie takes the last few stumbling steps forward, almost at a run so as to let her inertia help her heave the saddle up onto the horse's back. \nMattie I am going with you. \nLeBoeuf, cinching a saddle onto his woolly horse, looks around. \nLeBoeuf Oh, that izh not poshible. \nMattie Have I held you back? I have a Colt's dragoon revolver which I know how to use, and I would be no more of a burden to you than I was to the marshal. \nLeBoeuf That izh not my worry. You have earned your shpurzh, that izh clear enough--you have been a regular \"old hand\" on the trail. But Cogburn izh right, even if I would not give him the shatishfaction of consheding it. The trail izh cold, and I am conshiderably diminished. \nMattie How can you give up now, after the many months you've dedicated to finding Chaney? You have shown great determination. I misjudged you. I picked the wrong man. \nLeBoeuf I would go on in your company if there were clear way to go. But we would be shtriking out blindly. Chelmshford izh gone--we have chaished him right off the map. There izh nothing for it. I am bound for Texash, and it izh time for you to go home too. \nHe swings himself up onto the horse. \n. . . The marshal, when he shoberzh, izh your way back. \nMattie I will not go back. Not without Chaney, dead or alive. \nLeBoeuf I misjudged you as well. I eckshtend my hand. \nHe does, dropping a hand gloved in rough suede. She refuses to take it. \nMattie Mr. LeBoeuf! Please! \nHe remains with hand extended. She hesitates, sees there is no give, and reaches for up for the hand. They shake. \nLeBoeuf Adiosh! \nHe saws the horse around and sets it to a prancing walk, his spurs jingling. \nThe sound recedes, leaving behind Rooster's snoring from the campfire. \nCAMPFIRE \nRooster's snores bump up at the cut. \nMattie enters, gazes down for a thinking beat at the passed-out lawman, then lies down on her robe. \nShe lies still, gazing up. \nAfter a long beat she abruptly rises. \nShe recedes toward the horses. As she reaches them we hear Little Blackie snort and blow. \nMattie returns with a length of coiled rope. She plays it out in a loop around her robe. She lies down again. She closes her eyes. \n", "test3_true": "EARY MORNING \nWe are high and close on Rooster, asleep. Face mottled red, he looks like hell. He emits a symphony of respiratory noises as breath fights through layers of phlegm. \nReverse on Mattie, looking down at him. \nWider on the forlorn campsite--Mattie standing, Rooster awkwardly sprawled sleeping, LeBoeuf gone. \nClose on a bucket: Mattie's hand enters to grab it. \nEMBANKMENT \nWe hear rushing water. \nMattie descends, carefully stiff-legged, down a steep slope thick with trees and brush. \nShe emerges onto the bank of a fast-flowing stream, shallow at this point and loud. \nMattie takes a couple of steps into the water to dip the bucket. Soft, behind her, we see four horses watering at the opposite bank, just downstream. \nMattie stoops to fill the bucket. Turning as she straightens, she sees the four horses. \nSurprised, she drops the bucket and stares. \nThe horses huff and blow in the water. They are not wild--they wear tack--but there is no rider in sight, until: \nA man straightens and emerges from behind one of the horses. The first thing we notice about him is the silhouette of the rifle projecting over one shoulder, slung to the man's back with a piece of sash cord. \nHe looks at something floating by in the stream: Mattie's bucket. He looks up. We jump closer: \nThe man has a black mark on his forehead. \nSeeing Mattie, who still gapes at him, he hastily swings his rifle round and trains it on her. He takes cautious, splashing steps forward. \nChaney Well now I know you. Your name is Mattie. You are little Mattie the bookkeeper. Isn't this something. \nHe grins, relaxing. He slings the rifle back over his shoulder. \nMattie Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney. \nChaney What are you doing here? \nMattie I came to fetch water. \nMattie pulls the flour sack from her coat pocket and works carefully at the cord that cinches it shut. Chaney watches. \nChaney I mean what are you doing here in these mountains? \nMattie I have not been formally deputized but I am acting as an agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge Parker's court. \nMattie has the cinch loose. She reaches the Colt's Dragoon out of the sack and points it at Chaney. \n. . . I have come to take you back to Fort Smith. \nChaney looks at the gun. He grins and puts hands on hips. \nChaney Well I will not go. How do you like that? \nMattie There is a posse of officers up on the hill who will force you to go. \nChaney That is interesting news. How many is up there? \nMattie Right around fifty. They are all well armed and they mean business. What I want you to do now is come on across the creek and walk in front of me up the hill. \nChaney I think I will oblige the officers to come after me. \nMattie If you refuse to go I will have to shoot you. \nChaney Oh? Then you had better cock your piece. \nMattie gives a dismayed look at the gun and tries to pull the hammer back. It has a heavy pull: she struggles, using two thumbs. \nChaney watches, smiling. \n. . . All the way back til it locks. \nMattie I know how to do it. \nShe pulls the hammer back further and we hear it notch. She looks up. \n", "test3_id": 227}

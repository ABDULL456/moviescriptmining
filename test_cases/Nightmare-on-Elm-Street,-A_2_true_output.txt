COP (OS) Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor wants to show you something. 
THOMPSON gives MR LANTZ one final look, then heads upstairs. 
CUT TO: 
NOTE: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace NANCY walking through the 'dream streets' at night, and NANCY approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her entering the Boiler Room the final time. 
180.  INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180. 
LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.  As she comes downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the cellar door.  She opens the door. 
180A. INT.  NANCY'S CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                      180A. 
NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down. 
WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED. NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY goes through the door. 
180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B. 
NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her wits. 
She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an even deeper place down there.  She starts down. 
Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless. Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place. 
CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her. 
She stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs and whines like a huge dying dog. 
NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave. 
She turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks down. 
NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones. 
WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers. They're dripping blood. 
There's another BEEP. 
180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C. counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute warning. 
180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D. 
NANCY (quietly) Come out and show yourself, you bastard. 
No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of razor-blades flashing from his fingertips. 
He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump, that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark sump of blackness. 
180E. EXT.  THE HEAVENS.  NIGHT.                                         180E. 
CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air, the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex, glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from high, high over the earth. 
NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights, free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge. 
181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184 
185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185. 
NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and look at her watch once more. 
INSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero. 
She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes him in a desperate bearhug! 
The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186. 
NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.  Gasping, she takes a second to get her bearings 
ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up the net, ready for an assault from any direction. 
But the room is empty.

SAM They're heading for the door. 
ODA MAE (terrified) Jesus have mercy. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Willie forces open a back door. They head into the building. 
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Oda Mae and the others hurry into the hall. They rush down the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbor's door. A WOMAN opens it a crack. 
ODA MAE Emergency! Let us in! 
WOMAN Who you kiddin'? 
The Woman slams the door and locks it shut. Oda Mae looks frightened. 
INT. APARTMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Carl and Willie climb the stairs two at a time. 
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Oda Mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door. No one is home. Across the corridor an ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her head out to see what is going on. Before she can say anything they push their way inside. 
ELDERLY WOMAN What're you doin'? You can't come in here. The cat don't like visitors. She'll pee all over the couch. You wanna pay for... 
Oda Mae grabs the woman's mouth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - FISHEYE LENS VIEW 
just as Willie and Carl emerge from the stairwell. They head down the hall toward Oda Mae's door. Willie pulls out a gun, and fires. The lock shoots open. They rush inside. 
CUT BACK TO: 
ODA MAE 
in the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the peephole. The old woman is struggling and still trying to talk. Oda Mae's knees are wobbling. 
ODA MAE They're gonna find us. 
SAM No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em. 
ODA MAE Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that? 
SAM Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I? 
INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT 
Willie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun pointed, ready to fire. He seems furious when he realizes no one is there. 
WILLIE Looks like someone just left. 
CARL I'll check the building. 
ANGLE 
He rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway is empty. 
As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie nearly jumps out of his skin. 
WILLIE Damn! 
He stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant, a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked. 
Suddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie spins around in total dismay. 
Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the room. Sam laughs. 
WILLIE (continuing) Who's there? Who's doing that? 
ANGLE 
A pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself. 
Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees. 
WILLIE Oh God! 
There is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as the word "B-O-O!" emerges before him. He cries out. 
WILLIE (continuing) Let me outta here! 
Shaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror. Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs hold of the door and yanks it open.

FADE IN: 
EXT.  PARK - DAY 
Brief shot of duel. 
RODERICK (V.O.) My father, who was well-known to the best circles in this kingdom under the name of roaring Harry James, was killed in a duel, when I was fifteen years old. 
EXT.  GARDEN - DAY 
Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a distance. 
RODERICK (V.O.) My mother, after her husband's death, and her retirement, lived in such a way as to defy slander.  She refused all offers of marriage, declaring that she lived now for her son only, and for the memory of her departed saint. 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Mother and son walking together. 
RODERICK (V.O.) My mother was the most beautiful women of her day.  But if she was proud of her beauty, to do her justice, she was still more proud of her son, and has said a thousand times to me that I was the handsomest fellow in the world. 
EXT.  CHURCH - DAY 
Mother and son entering church. 
RODERICK (V.O.) The good soul's pleasure was to dress me; and on Sundays and Holidays, I turned out in a velvet coat with a silver-hilted sword by my side, and a gold garter at my knee as fine as any lord in the land.  As we walked to church on Sundays, even the most envious souls would allow that there was not a prettier pair in the kingdom. 
EXT.  FIELD - DAY 
A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick. 
RODERICK (V.O.) My uncle's family consisted of ten children, and one of them was the cause of all my early troubles; this was the belle of the family, my cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name. 
EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden, stables, barn and farm. 
Idealized images of Dorothy. 
RODERICK (V.O.) Ah!  That first affair, how well one remembers it!  What a noble discovery it is that the boy makes when he finds himself actually and truly in love with some one!  A lady who is skilled in dancing or singing never can perfect herself without a deal of study in private.  So it is with the dear creatures who are skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for instance, was always practicing, and she would take poor me to rehearse her accomplishments upon...

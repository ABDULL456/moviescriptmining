GLASS (scratching and rough) Thank you. 
Waki doesn't understand... just raises a cup of liquid... says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to drink. Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head, trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at his throat, and motions for him to drink. Glass stares in the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Bad medicine. 
Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) How long have I been here? 
Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said. 
GLASS (CONT'D) You're Sioux. I only know a bit a Pawnee. 
Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. Waki shakes her head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him. 
GLASS (CONT'D) The snow... my healin'. (points to himself) Me. (points to the ground) Here. How long? 
Waki shakes her head again. Glass leads her outside. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands, fingers outstretched. 
GLASS How many suns? Ten? 
Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand. She nods... SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Ten suns? 
Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again... closes them again... SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Christ. 
Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN and WOMEN staring at him. Children freeze in the middle of their play... all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each other... 
BOYS Tatanka Wicasa. 
...over and over. 
Glass stares back, unsure. Then... 
SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.) Buff-A-lo Man. 
Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) (very broken english) What they call you. (points to Glass' hair) Fur of Buff-A-lo. 
Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles. The children smile and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER. 
GLASS You speak English. 
SPOTTED HORSE Need words when trade with whites. 
GLASS Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here... havin' them care for me. (off Spotted Horse's nod) Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'... with the whites. 
SPOTTED HORSE (POINTS) Whites. Bra-zo. 
GLASS Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm tryin' to get. Is it far from here? 
Spotted Horse doesn't understand. Glass motions into the distance. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Far? Long way? 
Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Three days on horse? 
Spotted Horse nods... looks Glass over, and shakes his head. 
SPOTTED HORSE Not walk. Hides soon. 
Glass doesn't understand... until Spotted Horse points to a ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line.

Though no less concerned over Anna's disappearance than any of the others, Corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible attitude. Taking note of the stone hut before him, he observes it carefully and remarks: 
CORRADO It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses. 
SANDRO Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan? 
Claudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen. Suddenly, she finds a small piece of bread on the ledge of the window. She picks it up and starts examining it. Then, realizing the bread is still fairly fresh, exclaims: 
CLAUDIA Somebody must live here! 
CORRADO (after examining the bread himself) But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here. 
The discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors who has come up from the shore. 
SAILOR We had better get started. The storm may break any minute now. 
CLAUDIA (angrily) What do you mean! What about Anna? 
SANDRO (to the seaman) Tell Lady Patrizia that we can't leave now. In fact, we'll have to make a tour around the island... 
SAILOR Wouldn't it be better if you told that to the Lady yourself. I can't assume the responsibility for keeping the boat here. There's no place to tie it up... And then, you know, it's got a flat bottom, and if the sea gets a little too rough... 
SANDRO (angrily) That doesn't make any difference! If we have to stay, we'll stay! 
Aboard the yacht, which is circling the island, Sandro, Patrizia, Raimondo and one of the sailors are peering out over the side, scrutinizing the banks and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of Anna. The jagged cliffs appear enormously tall and ominous, harboring tiny grottoes in which someone could easily hide. 
PATRIZIA Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something... 
SANDRO Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow. 
PATRIZIA But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro. 
Incensed by her remark, which he considers to be absurd, Sandro moves away from Patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices Corrado signaling to them from a remote section of the beach. 
CORRADO (calling out) There are some footprints around here... 
But he stops in the middle of the statement, and throws up his arms to indicate that the discovery is really of little significance. So he proceeds to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended, and the yacht continues on its way. 
SANDRO (calling from the stern, excitedly) Patrizia! 
Both Patrizia and Raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards where Sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up ahead. 
RAIMONDO (to the sailor) Mario...Steer the boat that way. 
The yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water, but as they come up close, they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of furniture. The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo. 
SAILOR Shall I turn back? 
SANDRO No. Now that we're here, let's have a look around Basiluzzo. (then turning to Patrizia) When we were swimming, she swam out in that direction. 
SAILOR It won't be easy to find a place to go ashore. 
The first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of Lisca Bianca. The sky is now even gloomier, streaked with flashes of lightning. Rumbling sounds of thunder are heard in the distance. The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety. They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance. 
SANDRO Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.

F I'm boring you, aren't I? 
NATALIE 
(SOFTLY) No, not at all, I was just... . just thinking. 
F About what? 
NATALIE About you. . ,school,

NATALIE I know you would. 
F What if I wait a year? 
NATALIE 
R 
F A year's not going to make a difference. 
NATALIE You can't do that, Frank. 
F I've thought a lot about this. 
NATALIE But you told me it takes forever just to establish yourself. 
F Exactl , so what's a year in forever? Know w at Duncan said today? She can't suppress a smile. 
NATALIE You wouldn't be changing the subject would you? 
FRANK Yes. 
NATALIE What now? 
F He said, "Frank, I don't think Jason really understands girls." 
NATALIE 
(LAUGHING) He didn't! 
F He did ... "understands girls!" 
NATALIE What did you say? 
F I said, "give him time, Duncan." They both break up. 
F I didn't know what to say! if this is how he is now - boy are we in trouble- He stops short. The word - We - hangs in the air. They watch each other, unsure of how to react. Changing the subject quickly. Frank reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys. A real musclebound superhero. Somewhat grotesque.

I NT. ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess. The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s: This afternoon they were sw' Â°ng. A few look sleepy enough to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices. They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice." 
CHORUS (SUBTITLED) Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool water. There is my dear village and in that village, the prettiest girl. Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a place of pure self. The song ends. 
RUTH That was really good! OK it's 7:30 we should stop. The girls gather up their things quickly. 
RUTH Remember when you sing these words- The way we feel about the harbor, is how the Balkans felt about the river Sava. The girls start out of the room.

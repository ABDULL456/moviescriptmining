AUGUSTUS Yes. That's right. 
Augustus looks at the child and tries to smile. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) All the bad things. 
25 EXT: SLUM, STREET - DAY                                  25 
The streets are wet. High above several large Zeppelins plod across the sky. We crane down to street level to find a police car pulling up through the steam. Lilly gets out, Jones beside her, wolfing down another bun. 
There are cops everywhere. An alleyway is cordoned off. The dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like wolves, hassling the cops; some yell obscenities, generally along the lines of "where's the police when you need them?" Jones stares at the people. 
JONES Someone should flatten this cesspool and start again. 
Lilly and Jones move towards the police cordon. Immediately a reporter accosts them. 
STREET REPORTER Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any comments on the death? 
LILLY No. 
STREET REPORTER They're saying it was a Brother, is that true? 
Lilly stares at the reporter, pauses for thought. She whistles to one of the cops nearby, who then approaches. 
LILLY Arrest her. 
Jones and Lilly push past as the reporter protests at being manhandled. 
LILLY (continuing; to Jones) Find any witnesses and shut them up. 
Jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley. Lilly ducks under the crime scene tape, moving into the alley. 
26 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         26 
The alleyway is full of forensics personnel. Lilly moves deeper into the alleyway. We see her POV moving forward, finally revealing the body of the young woman who is surrounded by various forensics staff. Lilly talks to one. 
LILLY Can I step in? 
FORENSIC GUY With the traffic. What's it matter. 
Lilly moves forward. She can now see the woman more clearly. The woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet shining alabaster in the dark alley. Flashes from photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding Lilly and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene. 
Lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body. 
Another man now walks up and kneels next to Lilly; young, good looking, obviously takes pride in himself. 
DOMINIC Lil'. 
LILLY Hello Dominic. 
DOMINIC Have you seen it? 
Dominic bends down and moves the dead woman's head, displaying the side of her neck. A bite has torn the skin on the side of her neck. The wound extends down, the carotid artery sliced in two. 
DOMINIC (continuing) It's a bite. If you know what I mean? 
Lilly nods, then looks down at the woman's dead, cockeyed stare. Lilly closes the woman's eyes. 
LILLY Any identification? 
She is passed a bloody ID. Lilly stares at it. 
LILLY (continuing) Tanya Garfield. 
Jones now arrives. 
JONES (to forensics team) Where do you get a cup of tea around here? 
No one answers. Jones shrugs.

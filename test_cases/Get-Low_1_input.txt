ANNOUNCER Okay. Now I have to say that you don't look quite like you do on the posters. 
BUSH I got pruned. 
ANNOUNCER Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir. I was a little nervous about our interview. I've heard some pretty wild stories.. 
BUSH Like what? 
ANNOUNCER Well uh, just.. from what I understand, you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it. Is that right? 
BUSH You come and tell yours. 
ANNOUNCER Thank you. Now how long have you been living out there by yourself? 
64 INT. MATTIE DARROW HOUSE - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS 64 
Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and arranging them in a vase. 
BUSH (O.S.) 40 some years. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 40 years with nobody to talk to? 
BUSH (O.S.) First 38 are the hardest. 
Mattie grins. 
65 INT. WCGM - CONTINUOUS 65 
ANNOUNCER But why would you do that, Mr. Bush, shut yourself off like that? Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear. 
BUSH Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out. 
ANNOUNCER You heard it here on WCGM, folks, find out the answer to the mystery February 16.. 
BUSH One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this? 
66 INT. DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6 6 
Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice. 
BUSH (O.S.) Gonna be a drawing. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) What kind of drawing, sir? 
BUSH You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years. Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower. 
67 INT. WCGM - SAME 67 
Dead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush. 
ANNOUNCER For 5 dollars? 
BUSH Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad. 
ANNOUNCER You heard him! If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars, send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. (off Frank waving and pointing to himself) Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home. As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth. 
FRANK

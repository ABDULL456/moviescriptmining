{"train": "\"xXx\" \nby \nRich Wilkes \nAugust 26, 2001 \nThird Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT \nOn a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones and medieval walls. \nA NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley. \nThere is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly heard from inside. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nHigh above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. \nHe pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES. \nA BOLT flies, trailing CABLE. \nTHUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below. \nEXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT \nAs he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins, sure he's heard something. \nBut there's nothing there. He continues on. \nThen the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above. \nWHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out. \nThe Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is STERLING. \nSTERLING I hate to drop in unexpectedly. \nSterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks it away. \nSterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see the \"ASTON-MARTIN\" LOGO. \nAs he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and flattens against the wall. \nA BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit. \nThe SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker. \nBAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons. \nCornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading towards. \nAs he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He smooths his hair and prepares to \"blend in\" with the crowd. \nINT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nSterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT. \nWe see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a bizarre German industrial-metal band. \nThe tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE OUTFITS. \nSterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken coop. \nON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA. \nYorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside. \nHe looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is. \nThey make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod. \nYorgi calmly issues orders into his phone. \nImmediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction. \nViktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE. \nSterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing through the freaky crowd. \nEXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nKirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT. \nFinally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD BUFFET. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. \nA STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn and SPEED OUT OF TOWN. \nWe shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK BUILDINGS. \nINT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nInside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS DOWN to a deep basement level. \nThe doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African- American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks sturdy, confident, deadly. \nAt the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR. \nINT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT \nGibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything. \nIf a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from down here. \nGibbons takes an elevator up. \nINT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief, looks down at the activity below. \nSAM TANNICK Come. \nGibbons enters, stands by the desk. \nGIBBONS Evening, Sam. \nSam remains in shadow. \nSAM TANNICK What do you have? \nGIBBONS Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called \"Ahab\". Whatever it is, it cost him his life. \nSAM TANNICK He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost. \nGIBBONS They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands. \nSAM TANNICK Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys \nGIBBONS We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it. \nSAM TANNICK How will you fix it? \nGIBBONS I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own. \nSAM TANNICK So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven. \nGIBBONS You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop. \nGibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN. \nGIBBONS The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde... \nSAM TANNICK The scum of the Earth. \nGIBBONS But programmable. And expendable. \nSAM TANNICK I've seen enough. Turn it off. \nGibbons clicks off the screen. \nSAM TANNICK They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over. \nGIBBONS That's exactly why we need them. \nSam sighs, stares out at the information room. \nSAM TANNICK Get these \"scum\", Mr. Gibbons, bring them in. Test them. Train them. Find your man. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT \nThe huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky. \nWe see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take position behind a FOUNTAIN. \nAt the last moment he throws out a \"bucket\" and his PARACHUTE OPENS. \nEXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT \nThe bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement. \nIt bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest. \nXander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape. \nAs COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike. \nSLAM TO: \nTITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF- PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nXander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another BACKPACK on his back. \nEXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT \nXander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building. \nINT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his motorcycle into the loft. \nThere are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls, MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description. \nXANDER Sky, you there? Start packin' cause we are out of here! \nThere's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by. \nHe hears her in the sectioned off \"bedroom\" and heads back there. \nXANDER Did I promise you a fat vacation or what? Get ready to get down in paradise. \nHe comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING. \nXANDER Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation... \nSKY I'm through, Xander. \nXANDER I can see that. Why? \nSKY You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore. \nXANDER I'm having fun, what's the problem? \nSKY You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much \"integrity\" for that. \nXANDER I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money... \nHe opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH. \nXANDER I got an advance on the next bootleg. Let's get out of here, just you and me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for a couple months. \nShe sorts through the money. \nSKY French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there? \nXANDER Alright, so I'll get more. \nSKY It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability. \nXANDER Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now. \nHe pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING. \nSKY What...? \nXANDER I was gonna wait till the islands, but... \nSKY You're serious? \nXANDER Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I? \nSKY (shakes her head) This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind? \nXANDER I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is. \nSKY You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere. \nXANDER You're not exactly \"going anywhere\" yourself. \nTRUCKER Shut up! (in Xander's face) You keep still or I'm gonna make damn sure you stop breathing today. Got that? \nXander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused. \nXANDER (shrugs) Alright, \"Buck\", whatever you say. \nThe Waitress let's out a whimper. \nTRUCKER Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register! Couldn't just let him leave, could ya! You know what I'm gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do ya?! \nShe goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor. Xander springs into action. \nHe CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the face. \nXander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him. \nThe Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed. \nXANDER Better shoot me quick. \nThe Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. Xander advances on him. \nXANDER Too late! \nHe unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw. \nThe Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors. \nXander turns to the terrified Waitress. \nXANDER Alright, bitch, what's going on? \nShe stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun. \nXANDER Talk! What's the game? Who are you people? \nThe front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, Mr. Cage? \nXANDER Who the hell are you? \nGIBBONS The name's Gibbons. You were saying? \nXANDER What is this place? \nGIBBONS Looks like a diner. \nXANDER Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a \"salesman\" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a \"trucker\", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I \"walked\" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why? \nHe aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt. \nXANDER Cuz there's nothing but blanks in these guns. And no offense, but their performances were terrible. \nXander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly smile. \nGIBBONS Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat. \nGibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up. \nGIBBONS Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same. \nXANDER That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway? \nGIBBONS Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character. \nXANDER Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit. \nGIBBONS It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy. \nXANDER A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch. \nGIBBONS Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. \"Many are called, few are chosen\", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge? \nXANDER ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy. \nGIBBONS Why is that? \nXANDER Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble. \nGIBBONS Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years. \nXANDER Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking. \nGIBBONS You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me. \nXANDER Is that a fact? \nGIBBONS Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea. \nNARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's. \nXander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING. \nA squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move. \nHe rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the HEADLIGHTS of a truck. \nNarcos hop out and charge forward. \nXander raises his hands. \nXANDER You boys are too good for me. Guess I failed this one, huh? \nThey grab him and haul him away. \nINT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT \nWe see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it. \nAttached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander. \nHe's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy HAY. \nBehind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both HOG-TIED. \nXANDER So much for \"every man for himself\". Nice to see you again, fellas. \nT.J. They really went all out on this one. This is a pretty gnarly setup. \nVIRG Check the table in the corner. \nThere's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door. \nXANDER This oughta be good. \nThen they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED. \nA very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the LEADER. \nXANDER This must be el jefe. How's it goin' jefe? Some weather we're havin'. \nNarco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them. \nJefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH. \nXANDER What's on the menu tonight? The old blowtorch-to-the-family jewels routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want roasted nuts, let's break out the Planters. \nT.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering look. \nJEFE Do you know what we do with people come round here? You know what we do with people come in our business? \nJefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing it. \nJEFE We cut the Achilles tendon. Your feet flop around like a marionette. You ain't walkin' nowhere no more. Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe instead you wanna tell me something. \nHe stops in front of Xander. \nJEFE Whatchu doing here? \nXANDER Oh, I don't know. It was an accident. \nJEFE That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard. \nHe BACKHANDS Xander across the face. \nJEFE We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys? \nXANDER We're anti-social. We don't have any friends. \nJefe SLAPS him again. \nJEFE No friends, huh? That's funny, I don't know no U.S. Army that comes without no friends. That's cuz U.S. Army is pussies. They always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses. So don't you tell me you all alone out here, my friend. You bullshitting the wrong guy. \nXander looks over at T.J. and Virg. \nXANDER Who's writing this dude's dialogue? \nVIRG He's a pretty good actor, though. \nT.J. Makes the diner look like a sixth grade play. He's even got them crazy eyes. \nJEFE You ain't begun to see crazy yet, amigo. \nXANDER We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'. \nJEFE You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling. \nGibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like grip of his thumb and middle finger. \nGIBBONS One twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus. Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and I don't feel the urge to stop just yet. So think carefully before you tell me: Is \"kiss my ass, Hop- along\" your final answer? \nThe fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He looks over, sees the bone saw start revving. \nXANDER (choking) No. \nGibbons releases his grip. \nGIBBONS I thought you might see it my way. \nThen Xander starts walking away. \nGIBBONS Where you going, X? I said where you going? \nThe Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him. \nXANDER You tell me. \nXander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream. \nXANDER There better be a movie on this Goddam flight. \nINT. GULFSTREAM - DAY \nXander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits. \nA NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle. \nXANDER How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack? \nGIBBONS Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear? \nXANDER Yeah, I spy or I die. \nINT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET \nOrange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product placement opportunity for an AIRLINE). \nXander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the smoked glass windows. \nThe Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC DEVICE. \nNERDY AGENT This is your communicator. You'll identify yourself by a call sign. From here on out you're Bulldog Omega \nXANDER You must stay up late to come up with shit like that. \nGIBBONS I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports. \nXANDER Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. \nGibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking. \nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET \nThe phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up. \nAGENT Uh... Call signs derive from the parameters of the mission. \nGIBBONS If he doesn't like it, we can make an exception just this once. We'll call him \"Triple X\". \nThey walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH BADGES to the GATE WORKERS. \nXANDER Up yours. \nGIBBONS Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene. \nXander is the last one to board the plane. \nXANDER Is that all? \nGIBBONS Just remember, I'll be watching. \nAs the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx of Agents. \nXANDER I've got something for you to chew on. Next time you send someone to save the world, make sure they like the planet the way it is. \nThe jet's door CLOSES. \nINT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT \nXander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool graphics. \nThe KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look. \nKID What game is that? \nXander picks it up and carries it into the building. \nINT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY \nDumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO. \nSLOVO Sit down. \nXANDER I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand. \nIvan 1 shoves him into a chair. \nSLOVO My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you. \nXANDER Here we go again. \nSLOVO You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our. \nXANDER First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest. \nXander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with hatred. He heads to the door. \nSLOVO Be ready in three hours. \nSlovo exits. Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander. \nEXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT \nA fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass, expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous. \nXander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a Tshirt that says \"RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND\" complete with a photo of the Hedgehog. \nINT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT \nA STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS and BELLY SHIRTS. \nThere's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are cutting back and forth on. \nWEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG HIPSTERS. \nXander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE SKATES. \nXANDER Nice hops. \nSLOVO The corner. Anarchy 99. \nSlovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded by straight faced BODYGUARDS. \nWhat ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times... These guys are living like rock stars. \nThey're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an \"I AM EVIL\" Tshirt. \nSLOVO See the one with the funny colored hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee-cap. There they are, American. The low-rent millionaire criminals. And you thought only your country had white trash. American? \nHe looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit, pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him, not by the door but deeper in the club. \nSLOVO Oh no! \nHe sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and start talking to them. \nSLOVO Jesus Christ! \nSlovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing at him and waving him over. \nSLOVO (horrified) What the hell...? \nSlovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi looks him up and down. \nXANDER That's the guy. \nYORGI This pizda? Never seen him before. \nXANDER (to Slovo) Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead? \nSLOVO Uh... I am... I work in insurance. \nXander grabs Slovo and starts searching him. \nSLOVO (panicked whisper) What the hell are you doing? \nHe slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's police badge. \nXANDER Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on the mack. \nThe Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone. \nYORGI Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out? \nINT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING \nWe see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway. \nINT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING \nAgent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him, waving a COMMUNIQU\u00c9. \nGibbons grabs the communiqu\u00e9, reads it. He looks up, stunned. \nINT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY \nXander is having coffee at his window when his communicator RINGS. \nXANDER (into phone) I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. \nINTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM \nGIBBONS If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. \nXANDER Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money. \nGIBBONS One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! \nXANDER I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not? \nGIBBONS We're not after car thieves here. \nXANDER What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick. \nGIBBONS That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period. \nXANDER Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too? \nGIBBONS My friend, if you're planning on crossing me... \nXANDER I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out. \nXander hangs up. \nINT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY \nGibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the communiqu\u00e9. \nSAM TANNICK Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time. \nGIBBONS I think we should send him whatever he wants. \nSAM TANNICK You what? A wire transfer of this size? \nGIBBONS If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely. \nSAM TANNICK You're talking about a very expensive risk here. \nGIBBONS He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. (beat) I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen. \nSAM TANNICK Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you? \nGibbons smiles. \nSAM TANNICK Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. \nGIBBONS So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY \nA HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut. He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is TOBY LEE SHAVERS. \nSlovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle. \nSLOVO Your government must know something we don't. \nShavers walks up to them. \nSHAVERS Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s. \nXANDER That's would be me. \nShavers gives him a disapproving look. \nSHAVERS Figures. You got someplace we can spread out my gear or what? I mean today. \nSlovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, muttering to himself. \nSLOVO I'll leave you two alone to talk. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY \nThe TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch. \nThe Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander supervises. Anders hovers around him. \nANDERS So what you think? Beautiful! \nSitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra. \nPetra has a LAPTOP. \nYORGI Has it arrived yet? \nPetra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their BANK ACCOUNT. \nPETRA Nothing. He had two days. \nYORGI Perhaps he is not all he says he is. \nOutside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office. Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL. \nXander opens the door. \nXANDER Very nice. I'm impressed. \nYORGI I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem... \nJust then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles. \nXANDER I had to inspect the merchandise first. \nYORGI Of course. \nHe nods for Kirill to stand down. \nOUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER. \nXANDER What's this? \nYORGI This is a gift. From me to you. \nAnders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC GTO. \nYORGI It's a little nothing, you take it. \nXander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger seat. \nYORGI Come on, get in. \nXander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine ROARS. \nXANDER You're alright, Yorgi. \nNext door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's got a camera with a big zoom lens. \nSLOVO Smile, bychara. \nSlovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the roof. \nCRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE. \nDown below, Kirill hears the noise. \nKIRILL Yorgi! \nThey all look to the abandoned building. \nThrough the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg poking through the ceiling. \nXander is taken aback. \nYORGI What in the hell...? \nYorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol. \nThinking fast, Xander does the same. \nThey draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw as well, all of them covering Xander. \nYORGI What's going on, my friend? \nXANDER You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what? \nYORGI He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you. \nXANDER (he cocks the hammer) Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of. \nXANDER How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere? \nYORGI Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss. \nYorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti. \nYORGI You hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy! \nYorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander joins her, but she won't even look at him. \nXANDER This is great, dancing with the back of your head. \nShe reluctantly turns around. \nXANDER If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing? \nPETRA Yorgi asked me to. \nXANDER You do everything Yorgi says? \nPETRA Go to hell. \nXANDER It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that? \nPETRA Mind your business. \nXANDER Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you. \nShe glares at him and walks away. Xander follows. \nXANDER Where are you going? \nPETRA Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home. \nXANDER I was invited. What's your story? \nPETRA I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions. \nThere's a big line outside the \"ladies\" and no line at the \"men's\". Petra heads into the Men's Room. \nSome DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink. \nXANDER Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you. \nPETRA Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. \nXANDER That right? Why's that? \nThe stall door flies open and Petra marches out. \nPETRA My chest is too small and my brain is too big. \nShe shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall. \nXander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing. \nAcross the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and puts on \"ANARCHY BURGER\" by the Vandals. The rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat. \nYORGI Xander, check it out! The revolution begins! \nViktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys. \nYORGI Let's get some air, man. \nYorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries out another door. \nEXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT \nIt's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river. \nXANDER You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live. \nYORGI It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me. \nXANDER I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg. \nYORGI You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well? \nXANDER Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen. \nYORGI Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere. \nXANDER My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch. \nThe camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a window with his SNIPER RIFLE. \nP.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs. \nXANDER The things I have to do for my country. \nHe gives in and starts making out with her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING \nXander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him, we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING \nAnders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and goes through another door. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY \nXander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom. In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some drawers. \nPETRA What are you doing? \nHe turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN. \nXANDER Looking for a phone book. I want to call a cab. Unless you wanna give me a ride? \nShe shuts the door, advances, staring him down. \nPETRA Who are you? \nXANDER We hung out last night, remember? \nPETRA I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for? \nXANDER Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck. \nShe SLAPS him, hard. \nPETRA Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. \nXANDER You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid. \nShe SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go. \nXANDER Hey, you're good. \nPETRA Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are. \nXANDER That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who? \nINT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThere are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at his COMPUTER in his underwear. \nHe's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network. \nYORGI Something bothers me about you, Mr. Xander Cage... \nHe looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for. \nHe sits up, getting pissed. \nYORGI Get Kirill. Now! \nShe heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on his face. \nKirill enters, still half asleep. \nKIRILL What's the problem? \nYORGI I'm inside the police mainframe. Do you see anything? \nKirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes. \nKIRILL What? \nYORGI I've searched their E-mail. No funeral announcement, no obituary, no call- to-arms. Nothing on the news, even. I swear I saw a cop get shot yesterday. How come no one is talking about it? \nKirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there. \nYORGI I also check the wire transfer. I follow the money back to it's source, but there is no source. It comes from nowhere. First they bring CIA, then British SAS, now maybe they plumb the lower depths. Maybe now they send someone who looks like us. Maybe someone like our houseguest Mr. X. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY \nPetra still has the gun on Xander. \nPETRA I don't know what you're talking about. \nXANDER The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra. \nXANDER What's up? Is there a problem? \nShe studies his eyes, decides to risk it. \nPETRA They tell me you're an American agent. \nXANDER What are you talking about? \nPETRA There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true. \nXANDER It's a long story, but yeah, more or less. \nPETRA Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people. \nXANDER If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me. \nPETRA That's alright, I'll figure something out. \nXANDER Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down. \nEXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY \nKirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE. \nP.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way towards the exit. \nKIRILL Nice and easy, Petra... \nINT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY \nThey work their way through the lunchtime crowd. \nPETRA I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse. \nXANDER They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now. \nEXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY \nXander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the door, a BUS passes by. \nKirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass. \nP.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible through the bus windows. \nKirill's finger tightens on the trigger... \nAs soon as the bus passes he FIRES! \nBut Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe. \nCRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise, Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block. \nHe runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows. \nAt the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL RAIL down the middle. \nAs he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink flying. \nHe hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too fast for Kirill. \nHe jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE AIR. \nKirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon. \nBy now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in frustration. \nPetra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a \"Where did he go?\" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her performance. \nThen she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO speeding away. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON \nWe're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's legendary \"Troll Wall\". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to the ocean. \nSix figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear webbed \"squirrel\" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship. \nPetra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen. \nFIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military style. He's got his \"stakeout suit\" on and is keeping low. \nHE CHECKS HIS WATCH: \"6 PM\" \nThe members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall. \nXander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group freefailing down the sheer cliff face. \nXANDER What the hell...? \nHe pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding. \nWith the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts LISTING. The thing is going down. \nHe pans over, clicks into \"penetrator\" mode, and sees the Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped, their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS. \nEXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON \nXander puts down the binoculars and gets up. \nXANDER No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed to be an observer. Aw shit. This job sucks. \nHe pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle. \nXANDER Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't work, your ass is kicked. \nXander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths. \nThen he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff... \nAnd that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down. \nSuddenly we're falling with him. \nWe hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from the craggy rock face. \nThe force of the wind ripples his cheeks. \nHe streamlines himself into a track position and jets away from the cliff like Superman. \nBefore he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE. \nImmediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL. \nXander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards the ship. \nEXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON \nPetra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him. \nYORGI What was that for? \nPETRA I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together. \nYORGI You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared. \nPETRA Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline. \nYORGI (smiles) Viktor! Stay the course. \nYorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below. \nEXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON \nXander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing deck and undoes his harness. \nHe sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck. \nXANDER Son of a bitch! \nHe looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away. \nEXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON \nPetra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved. \nThen she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the price. \nEXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON \nXander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in. \nWith the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below decks. \nINT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON \nXander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound. \nAs the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in from this one and Xander has to get it shut. \nHe swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising rapidly, filling up the compartment. \nXander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but the force of the water is too much. \nHe surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before he can close that door. \nKirill is almost on top of him. \nXander sights up and FIRES. \nThe fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill. \nXander makes a run for it. \nEveryone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing tapestries off the walls. \nXander dives and crashes through the window. \nEXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE \nXander tuck and rolls, comes up running. \nGuards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going on. \nXander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM! \nThe EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up. \nHe points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a \"ramp\" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE. \nA Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim. \nXander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL before he can shoot. \nThe Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go. \nYORGI He blew the gate control. Anders! Get the bastard! \nAnders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him go, hoping for the best. \nEXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK \n(NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated by a physical reason) \nXander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end. \nAt the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall. \nXander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel, he hops onto the wall. \nThe machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows. \nThey are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide. \nThey make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes a detour. \nHe hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION. \nINT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING \nCONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle leaps into their building. \nXander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE. \nAnders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE. \nXander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x 4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE. \nMore WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes onto the roof. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING \nXander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS. \nAnders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and follows Xander. \nThey jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as they race towards that last apartment building. \nNeck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump, Xander pulls up behind Anders. \nThey hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right behind him. \nThey skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories below. \nHe glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control. \nAnders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie and RAMS Anders over the edge. \nThe bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground. \nXander turns and rides to the next apartment building. \nHe hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually take him to street level. \nPETRA I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. \nShe drags him to the door. \nEXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY \nThe beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river. There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it. \nXANDER Where are we going? \nPETRA We're getting out of this place. We've done enough. \nXANDER Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent? \nPETRA It doesn't matter anymore, forget it. \nXANDER Of course it matters. Hey, hold on! \nPETRA What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. \nXANDER Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that. \nPETRA No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander? \nXANDER We can't leave now. We have to do something. \nPETRA Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said. \nXander grabs her by shoulders. \nXANDER Alright, so I was full of shit. I thought believing in things was wrong. Turns out believing in nothing is worse. You might as well be dead. I'm not thrilled with the world, but I'm not gonna let those idiots start killing people. Come on, you're a cop, we've got to get these guys. \nHe's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement. \nPETRA They left. To a fortress in the mountains. \nXANDER We'll have to go after them. \nPETRA Aren't you afraid? \nXANDER A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine. \nPETRA I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi. \nXANDER You don't have to do that. \nPETRA Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside. \nXANDER Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been? \nPETRA (shrugs) I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. (beat) I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt. \nXANDER When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation. \nPETRA What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet. \nXander kisses her. \nXANDER That gives us something to live for. \nTogether they walk back across the bridge. We crane up, revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big BUILDING on the river. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY \nWe see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock strewn, near vertical drop. \nThen we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a helluva climb. \nXander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's beautiful up here. \nHe pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on his feet. \nXander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging to rocks for balance. \nOn the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants. \nEXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY \nViktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his men. \nA Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER. \nViktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE. \nAll around him the Guards are driving into position. They form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them. \nViktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling. \nXANDER How's Ivan? \nIVAN 2 He is okay. \nXANDER Thanks for coming, man, you guys were right on time. \nIVAN 2 We are always on time. Two have escaped, in truck. \nPETRA Yorgi and Kirill. \nXANDER Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them. \nIVAN 2 Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he send something for you. \nEXT. CASTLE - DAY \nA big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out. \nIVAN 2 We'll be right behind you. \nXander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols. \nXANDER Did you do your homework? \nPETRA (nods) If they launch it, I know how to bring it back. \nXANDER Let's do this. \nThey both climb in and the GTO peels out. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nXander drives all out, trying hard to catch up. \nHe passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip. \nUp ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the mountain. \nXANDER Where's he headed? \nPETRA He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there. \nXander floors it. \nUp ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the GTO gaining on them. \nYORGI (in Russian, subtitled) They're coming! Get back there. \nKirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container. \nAs the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK! The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows the headrest off Xander's seat. \nXANDER You get down! I'll take care of this fool! \nHe pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window. \nPETRA No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind the nerve agent! \nAnother shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror. \nXANDER Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable! \nKirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the sights. \nXander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide. \nThe GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain. \nXander fights for control as they slide around the turns. \nThe road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY \nThe truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex. \nQuickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen up above. \nThe GTO comes at the gates at full speed. \nXANDER Let's see what my man put together. \nXander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He flips one. \nThe HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER. \nBRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin. \nXANDER I guess the surgeon general was right. \nANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river. \nXander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination. \nPetra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She presses buttons desperately. \nPETRA He's shut out the communication circuit! \nXANDER You can't talk to it? \nPETRA No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls. \nXANDER A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better. \nXander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT. \nXANDER Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going down! Have them evacuate downtown! \nEXT. THE RIVER - DAY \nYorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on them and he reloads his weapons. \nXander drives while Petra checks her controller. \nPETRA It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. \nXANDER It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right? \nPETRA By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate! \nXANDER Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater! \nThey're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast. \nDown below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath the water. \nPETRA There it is! Hold it steady! \nPetra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet GRAZES Petra's arm. \nXANDER Petra! \nShe loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment. \nXander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters. \nThey are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and \nXander battle it out while Petra steers the boat. \nPETRA Xander! It's coming up! \nXander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm. \nXander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold. \nYORGI This is going to be exciting, buddy! Front row seats to the apocalypse! Come on, sing with me! (singing madly) \"I am an Antichrist / I am an anarchist / I... wan-na be... Anarchy!\" \nXander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips him and they both topple overboard. \nThey land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. Charles bridge. \nOn the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from the river. \nXander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake. \nAhab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open. \nInside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION. \nXANDER No you don't. \nHe pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is BEEPING menacingly. \nIN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT. \nHe looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the bridge above him. Total strangers... \nThe fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. \nThrough the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact. \nThen Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab starts to DIVE. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \n", "test1_input": "Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way. \nHe's been corralled by one of the Helicopters. \nHe's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night Sun. \nXander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the camouflage netting. \nVIRG They're all over the place! What the hell's going on? \nXANDER Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war. \nThe Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting. \nThey're pinned down. \nXANDER Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go that way, I'm gonna go this way. They can't follow us both. \nThey squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking up DUST all around them. \nXANDER Go! \nThey jet off in opposite directions. \nXander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult. \nHe's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS. \nSuddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out. \nXANDER Shit! \nThe CHOPPER swoops down after him. \nIts big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him. \nBRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him. \nXander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in \"North By Northwest\", except instead of corn fields, Xander's running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS. \nXander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him. \nXander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants. \nAll around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE. \nTwo choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with their guns. Narcos run terrified. \nXander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front of him. He SNAPS IT OFF. \nXANDER I'm gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this. \nHe tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT FOREST. \nXander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS OF COCAINE. He heads for it. \nThen the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around him. \nXander hauls ass, heading for the truck. \nBullets chew up the dirt all around him. \nAs the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK. \nThere is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up. \nWHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts into the night air. \nXander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into FILTHY WATER. \nA powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white. \nNear him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls inside. \nThe Chopper makes another pass overhead. \nThe big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on. \nXander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe. \nJEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN flood the compound. There's no going back. \nXander turns and makes his way along the tree line. \nThe chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea. \nAs he goes by, one of the TREES moves. \n", "test1_true": "Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds, the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape. \nThey fall on him like a curtain. \nXANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD is pulled over his head. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY \nAs the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE. \nThe hanger doors slide shut with a THUD. \nWe see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away. \nXander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier smirks as he walks away. \nXander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB. \nXANDER Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it Saturday already? \nThe Black Ops guys grin knowingly. \nOn the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him. \nGIBBONS Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. \nXANDER You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there. \nGIBBONS Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me. \nXander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the \nGIBBONS You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution. \nXANDER You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy. \nGIBBONS You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help. \nXANDER I'm not interested. I've already got a job. \nGIBBONS You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger. \nXANDER I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead. \nGIBBONS That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge. \nAs they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another plugs in a BONE SAW. \nXANDER What's this? You're gonna try to scare me now? \nGibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch. \nGIBBONS Do you know the reason why I try to recruit guys like you? There's no risk. \nHe tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID. \nGIBBONS There's nobody back home who's gonna ask questions if you just... disappear for a while. \nIn seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a oily cloud of residue. \nGibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home. \nXANDER Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for? \nGIBBONS There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people. \nXANDER What do I get out of it? \nGIBBONS If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath. \nXANDER You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along. \nGibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming. \nThe Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a fight. \nXANDER Not bad for a gimp. \nGIBBONS What's with that \"X\" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're \"extreme\"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head. \nXander gets up. \nXANDER I'll take that under advisement. Maybe I can be like you and lose a leg for the old Stars and Bars. I bet the flag's a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs. \n", "test2_input": "XANDER Right behind you. \nThey keep talking, pretending to shop. \nXANDER So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what? \nPETRA No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece. \nXANDER We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that? \nPETRA (beat) There's something I didn't have time to tell you before. \nXANDER What's that? \nPETRA I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year. \nXANDER You're what? What the hell have you been doing? \nPETRA I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal. \nXANDER I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger. \nThis stings her. She knows well the price she paid. \nPETRA No, I guess I've been no help at all to you. \nXANDER Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here. \nPETRA Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice. \nXANDER When can I see you again? \nPETRA You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember? \nThen she's off into the crowd. \nEXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT \nThe craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK, packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST. \nHe grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up the side. \nHe reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house. \nVIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy. \nXander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below. \nEXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT \nXander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX. \nHe waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a basement window. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT \nXander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor. \nLaid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to RETROFIT the thing. \nThey are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES. \nXander can't hear a thing through the thick glass. \nHe takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain. \nINT. DRAIN PIPE \nWe follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a rollercoaster and then levels off. \nThe ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls like a pill bug. \nSix metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn. \nINT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nWe're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on the water. \nThe roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V. \nWe see a handheld video image of Viktor. \nVIKTOR Okay, fire one. \n", "test2_true": "YORGI Perfect! \nPull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his communicator. Using a joystick he's able to control the roach. \nHe steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT. \nHe smiles, enjoying himself. \nXANDER Great piece of hardware. \nHe plugs his earpiece in and listens in. \nINT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nPetra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER. \nThe roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better look at Ahab. \nAnders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID. \nEach canister is separated in two, with a BLACK LIQUID on top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom. \nHe hands the canisters to Viktor one by one. \nANDERS (singing) \"Silent Night... Holy Night\" \nViktor laughs and joins in. \nThen Kirill looks down and SPOTS THE ROACH CAM. \nHe STOMPS it with his boot. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT \nXander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear. \nXANDER Damn. \nHe looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to examine the roach. Time to go. \nINT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nKirill lifts the dead \"roach\" and sees its wires. \nKIRILL There's some bullshit going on! \nYorgi hits an ALARM switch, alerting the guards. \nThe Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the house. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - VARIOUS - NIGHT \nThe Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced close combat maneuvers. \nCueing each other with hand signals, they run through each room, weapons ready. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nXander sprints down the hallway. With the Anarchy 99 boys and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding his way out. \nINT. DINING HALL - NIGHT \nHe runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room. \nKirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing. \nXander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly. \nKirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the door. \nYORGI Xander, my friend, that can only be you. Why don't we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends. How would you like to come to work for us instead? We could Rage Against the Machine together. \nAcross the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He calls out to Yorgi. \nXANDER Speaking of people that are full of shit, funny you should mention those guys! \nXander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it impossible to pinpoint. \nXANDER They put their records out through Sony, one of the biggest corporate machines on the planet. Some revolutionaries, huh? \nHe pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer. \nAgainst the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. \nYORGI Come on, you're the one who's fooling yourself. Why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a future that is truly free? \n", "test3_input": "Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface. \nWe see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making this impossible climb. \nAt the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky chasm below. \nUsing all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws. \nAt the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge. \nThe Guard FALLS into the chasm. \nXander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD rushes him, grabbing for his rifle. \nXander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the Guard down. \nHe pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower. \nINT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY \nXander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level. \nAs he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he just left. \nThere is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander. \nGUARD (in Russian) What's going on? \nXander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops. \nUp inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT. \nXander takes aim. \nPOV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE \nFrom up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights. \nBLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning. \nXander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with some Guards. \nYorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face. \nYORGI That was for Anders. \nXANDER Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run. \nYorgi punches him again. \nINT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY \nPetra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with Xander and Kirill. \nYORGI Look who we found playing outside. \nPetra looks up. She can barely hide her shock. \nYORGI Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice anything strange about X? He looks slightly less than dead. \nKirill aims his gun at Petra. \nPETRA Yorgi, I thought he was -- \nYorgi SLAPS her. \nYORGI Do you think I didn't know about you all along? My contacts in the KGB told me you were coming. You show up undercover and, I must admit, you play your part to the hilt. When it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. When it's time to be passionate, you are very very passionate indeed. \nPetra is devastated by this revelation. \nYORGI I could have killed you, but I thought this would be so much more fun. To twist you and use you how I see fit. And to be honest, you went much farther than I ever expected you would for your country. \nHe runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander. \nYORGI And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much? \nXANDER I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. \nYORGI Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is. \nPETRA The Peace conference... \nYORGI Nice place to start, don't you think? \nXANDER What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche. \nYORGI You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves. \n", "test3_true": "YORGI Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want. \nXANDER Including rape, pillage, murder. \nYORGI Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it. \nXANDER And here I thought \"anarchy\" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt. \nYORGI Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it. \nPETRA Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three. \nXANDER He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool. \nYORGI You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of -- \nXANDER Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked. \nYorgi's eye twitches. \nYORGI Screw you too, buddy. \nHe raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM! A massive explosion rocks the whole castle. Shrapnel shatters the windows, spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide. \nEXT. THE CASTLE - DAY \nThe front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets. \nINT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY \nKirill looks down at the carnage below. Xander takes advantage of the distraction and charges at Yorgi. \nYorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work. There's a HUGE SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm. \nBy the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him. He body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk. Kirill spins and starts FIRING. Xander ducks for cover. \nEXT. THE CASTLE - DAY \nThe Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the courtyard and burst into the main building. \nINT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY \nThe Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing down everyone in their path. \nOne Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate with a volley of RPG's that evaporates a pocket of resistance. \nIn the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away. Yorgi starts rounding up the computer gear. \nYORGI Hurry up, kill him! \nBefore Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying bullets everywhere. \nXander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage to make a fast exit out another door. \nXANDER Hey! We're on your side! \nThe Cops keep shooting. \nEXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY \nIvan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him and shoots him in the back. \nThey step over him and enter a GARAGE. \nINT. CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY \nThe Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear. \nEXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY \nThe truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across the courtyard. \nPolice open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts heading down the mountain. \nINT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY \nMeanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down. \nXANDER Petra! Tell them something! \nPetra starts calling out in RUSSIAN. Finally the cops stop shooting. \nEXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY \nXander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up. \n"}

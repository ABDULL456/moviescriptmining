Got that? \nXander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused. \nXANDER (shrugs) Alright, \"Buck\", whatever you say. \nThe Waitress let's out a whimper. \nTRUCKER Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register! Couldn't just let him leave, could ya! You know what I'm gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do ya?! \nShe goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor. Xander springs into action. \nHe CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the face. \nXander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him. \nThe Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed. \nXANDER Better shoot me quick. \nThe Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. Xander advances on him. \nXANDER Too late! \nHe unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw. \nThe Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors. \nXander turns to the terrified Waitress. \nXANDER Alright, bitch, what's going on? \nShe stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun. \nXANDER Talk! What's the game? Who are you people? \nThe front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, Mr. Cage? \nXANDER Who the hell are you? \nGIBBONS The name's Gibbons. You were saying? \nXANDER What is this place? \nGIBBONS Looks like a diner. \nXANDER Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a \"salesman\" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a \"trucker\", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I \"walked\" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why? \nHe aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt. \nXANDER Cuz there's nothing but blanks in these guns. And no offense, but their performances were terrible. \nXander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly smile. \nGIBBONS Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat. \nGibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up. \nGIBBONS Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same. \nXANDER That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway? \nGIBBONS Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character. \nXANDER Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit. \nGIBBONS It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy. \nXANDER A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch. \nGIBBONS Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. \"Many are called, few are chosen\", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge? \nXANDER ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy. \nGIBBONS Why is that? \nXANDER Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble. \nGIBBONS Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years. \nXANDER Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking. \nGIBBONS You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me. \nXANDER Is that a fact? \nGIBBONS Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea. \n", "test1_true": "GIBBONS (smiles) You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests. \nThere's a POP and Xander clutches his stomach. Gibbons tosses his DART GUN onto the table. Xander blinks at him. \nHe pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it. \nXANDER You bastards love to see me sleep. \nWHACK! He goes face down on the table. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nCLOSE ON - XANDER'S FACE \nHe comes to, blinking in low RED LIGHT. He's shocked to find that he's... \nINT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT \nXander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG, the other is T.J., ex-Navy. \nXander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles. \nVIRG What's so damn funny? \nXANDER Been to any good diners lately? \nThe three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat. \nT.J. We must be the final \"candidates\". \nThey quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE NOT ALONE. \nSitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM. \nXANDER Nobody told me this was a costume party. \nThe Black Ops Team, just stares. \nT.J. I've worked with guys like this before. Black Ops. Serious government spooks. \nVirg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have them. \nVIRG Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back? \nXANDER A parachute. This does not argue well. \nThen the red light switches to GREEN. \nOne of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J. \nVIRG This is bullshit! Hey! \nThey drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next, kicking and fighting. \nThen they turn on Xander. \nXANDER I get the picture. \nXander jumps out on his own. \nWe see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his chute BLOSSOMS OPEN. \nEXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT \nWe see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD. \nWe ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro. \nThe other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in SPANISH. \nVIRG Jee-zus, man! What the hell now? Another damn test? \nT.J. We should head for those trees. \nXANDER Don't look at me, brother. It's every man for himself. \nThey wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. \nXander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around. \nHe flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees stuns him. \nXANDER You gotta be kidding me. \nWe crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM. \n", "test1_id": 669, "test2_input": "XANDER The things I have to do for my country. \nHe gives in and starts making out with her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING \nXander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him, we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING \nAnders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and goes through another door. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY \nXander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom. In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some drawers. \nPETRA What are you doing? \nHe turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN. \nXANDER Looking for a phone book. I want to call a cab. Unless you wanna give me a ride? \nShe shuts the door, advances, staring him down. \nPETRA Who are you? \nXANDER We hung out last night, remember? \nPETRA I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for? \nXANDER Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck. \nShe SLAPS him, hard. \nPETRA Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. \nXANDER You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid. \nShe SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go. \nXANDER Hey, you're good. \nPETRA Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are. \nXANDER That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who? \nINT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThere are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at his COMPUTER in his underwear. \nHe's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network. \nYORGI Something bothers me about you, Mr. Xander Cage... \nHe looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for. \nHe sits up, getting pissed. \nYORGI Get Kirill. Now! \nShe heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on his face. \nKirill enters, still half asleep. \nKIRILL What's the problem? \nYORGI I'm inside the police mainframe. Do you see anything? \nKirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes. \nKIRILL What? \nYORGI I've searched their E-mail. No funeral announcement, no obituary, no call- to-arms. Nothing on the news, even. I swear I saw a cop get shot yesterday. How come no one is talking about it? \nKirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there. \nYORGI I also check the wire transfer. I follow the money back to it's source, but there is no source. It comes from nowhere. First they bring CIA, then British SAS, now maybe they plumb the lower depths. Maybe now they send someone who looks like us. Maybe someone like our houseguest Mr. X. \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY \nPetra still has the gun on Xander. \nPETRA I don't know what you're talking about. \nXANDER The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra. \n", "test2_true": "XANDER Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal. \nShe pulls back the hammer on her gun. \nXANDER It's cool, I feel you. I might even be able to help. Here, let me show you something. You wanna see what's in my pocket, I'll show you. \nHe makes a move and she jabs the gun at him. She reaches into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data recorder. \nPETRA What are you? \nXANDER I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it? \nINT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY \nYorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow. They both screw SILENCERS onto their PISTOLS. \nThey flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to burst into Xander's room. \nOne... \nTwo... \nTHREE! They kick in the door and aim their guns around. \nFlak Jacket sits up, terrified. \nYorgi and Kirill lower their guns. Viktor stumbles by in his underwear. \nYORGI Where is he? \nVIKTOR They went to breakfast. \nINT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY \nThis is a beautiful and historic Prague location with WINDOWS and a nice view. It's rather fancy and PACKED with UPSCALE PATRONS. Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room, sticking out badly in their grungy clothes. \nA WAITER takes their order. \nPETRA Perogies, potato pancakes, fried goose livers, the sausage plate and a pot of Turkish coffee. \nXander shakes his head. \nXANDER I'm just gonna have a garden salad. Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. \nThe Waiter takes off. Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at Xander. \nPETRA That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil. \nXANDER (shrugs) I'm from L.A. \nPETRA So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan? \nXANDER Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that. \nPETRA Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much. \nXANDER Don't judge a comic book by it's cover. \nPETRA You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you. \nXANDER I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound. \nPETRA Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it? \nXANDER The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business. \nPETRA All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts. \nXANDER We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it. \nPETRA A beach named X? That I'd like to see. \nXANDER So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out? \nShe thinks on it. Then her cell phone RINGS. \nPETRA (into phone) Da! \nKIRILL (O.S.) (on phone) Listen very carefully, Petra. We think Cage may be an American agent, do you understand what I'm telling you? \nPETRA (into phone) Yes. \nKIRILL (O.S.) (on phone) Don't worry, I've got your back. I'm right across the street, above the bakery. Just bring him outside and let me do the rest. \nKirill hangs up. She looks back at Xander, shell shocked. \n", "test2_id": 670, "test3_input": "XANDER I guess the surgeon general was right. \nANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river. \nXander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination. \nPetra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She presses buttons desperately. \nPETRA He's shut out the communication circuit! \nXANDER You can't talk to it? \nPETRA No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls. \nXANDER A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better. \nXander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT. \nXANDER Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going down! Have them evacuate downtown! \nEXT. THE RIVER - DAY \nYorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on them and he reloads his weapons. \nXander drives while Petra checks her controller. \nPETRA It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. \nXANDER It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right? \nPETRA By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate! \nXANDER Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater! \nThey're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast. \nDown below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath the water. \nPETRA There it is! Hold it steady! \nPetra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet GRAZES Petra's arm. \nXANDER Petra! \nShe loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment. \nXander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters. \nThey are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and \nXander battle it out while Petra steers the boat. \nPETRA Xander! It's coming up! \nXander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm. \nXander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold. \nYORGI This is going to be exciting, buddy! Front row seats to the apocalypse! Come on, sing with me! (singing madly) \"I am an Antichrist / I am an anarchist / I... wan-na be... Anarchy!\" \nXander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips him and they both topple overboard. \nThey land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. Charles bridge. \nOn the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from the river. \nXander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake. \nAhab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open. \nInside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION. \nXANDER No you don't. \nHe pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is BEEPING menacingly. \nIN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT. \nHe looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the bridge above him. Total strangers... \nThe fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. \nThrough the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact. \nThen Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab starts to DIVE. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \n", "test3_true": "Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men fighting. \nWe see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on Ahab and continues downstream. \nThen the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES. \nIt's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES, setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS. \nThe chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds. \nEXT. THE RIVER - DAY \nA FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils. \nEXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY \nIvan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the water, but there's no sign of Xander. \nGibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE, scanning the water. Nothing. \nTears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected. \nThen Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream. \nThere's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges. \nThe whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, walking up the boat ramp. \nHis shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't seen before. The Phoenix has risen. \nPetra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons. \nGIBBONS Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you. \nXANDER I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet? \nGIBBONS You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent. \nXANDER But I hate cops, remember? Except for her. \nGIBBONS Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys. \nXANDER Who says you're the good guys? \nHe starts walking off with Petra. \nGIBBONS You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside. \nXANDER Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles? \nGIBBONS On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric? \nXANDER No needles, huh? What about the acid bath? \nGIBBONS All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing. \nXANDER (smiles) You're a jerk-off, you know that? \nGibbons waves. \nGIBBONS We'll be talking soon, you'll see. You'll be back. \nXander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm. \nPETRA I can't believe my mission is finally over.

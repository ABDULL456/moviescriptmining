CONTINUED: 
TAWNY (CONT'D) Taste this. 
Keeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips. Then squints. 
TREVOR Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh? 
TAWNY For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew. 
TREVOR Not a very appetizing name. 
TAWNY Have some more. 
Trevor takes another sip of it. 
TAWNY (CONT'D) If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid. 
TREVOR You must have been very proud of yourselves... 
TAWNY It's getting hot in here. 
Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off. 
Trevor is speechless. 
Tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises. 
TREVOR Jesus... who did that to you? 
Tawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. 
TAWNY You're kidding right? 
Trevor shakes his head no. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TAWNY (CONT'D) You did! God, you are funny tonight. 
Tawny approaches Trevor who tenses up. 
TAWNY (CONT'D) Almost like I'm with somebody else. 
Trevor starts looking very ill. 
TREVOR Tawny I think I'm going to be sick. 
TAWNY Well now there's a compliment. 
Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath. Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has changed into something else entirely. 
A CENOBITE. 
The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity. 
The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him. 
Before Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally... 
... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when- 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
-he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. The various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING and PINGING like slot machines. 
Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm. 
ALLISON Sorry about that. There was a blockage in your oxygen hose. Won't happen again, promise.

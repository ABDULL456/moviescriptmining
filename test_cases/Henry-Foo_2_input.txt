FAY He thinks I'm a slut. 
And she starts crying again. Simon awkwardly touches her shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom. 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO 
Moments later. 
Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. He is staring sickly at 'the ring'. 
SIMON Henry? 
HENRY Simon, I don't feel so good. 
SIMON What's wrong? 
HENRY I feel all kinda clammy. And damp. 
Simon lifts the coffee container and smells it. 
SIMON How many of these did you have? 
Henry tries to remember. He squints. 
HENRY Seven. 
Simon puts the container down and sits at the table. 
SIMON Henry, we have to talk. 
HENRY Can I use your toilet? 
SIMON Fay's taking a shower. 
Henry grabs his stomach. He presses his hand against his chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring. 
HENRY How much you think I can get for this? 
He looks at Simon. 
SIMON (pauses) Henry, Fay's pregnant. 
Henry looks at him. 
SIMON Fay's pregnant with your child. 
Henry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut. 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM 
Moments later. 
Fay is in the shower as... 
Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, terrified and disgusted, in the shower. 
FAY Jesus, Henry! 
Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air. 
Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly. 
Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned. 
FAY Hey, Henry. You OK? 
He is destroyed, staring down at... 
The 'ring' he still holds in his hand. 
Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words... 
FAY Oh. Oh, Henry. 
And she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating and spent, on the toilet. 
INT. CHURCH -- DAY 
A month later. 
Mr Deng and Bu√±uel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into the church foyer. Once inside, he shakes them off and they stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, then stops, sees... 
Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon. She is beautiful. 
Henry calms down, deeply affected. 
Fay smiles down the aisle at him. 
Henry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and strides up the aisle. 
Also present at the ceremony are Vicky and Warren. Gnoc is maid of honor. 
INT. CHURCH -- DAY 
Later. 
Henry holds Fay's hand and repeats after Father Hawkes. 
FATHER HAWKES I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife. 
HENRY I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife. 
FATHER HAWKES And do promise before God and these witnesses... 
HENRY And do promise before God and these witnesses...

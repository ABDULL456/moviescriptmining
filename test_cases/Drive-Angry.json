And if you don't tell me what I want to know... NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it. \nThe Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a step back. \nACCOUNTANT You had something to say? \nNORMAJEAN He was here. Earlier. \nACCOUNTANT Yes. We've established that. \nNORMAJEAN Terrible tipper. \nACCOUNTANT I'm sure he was. Where did he go? She points. \nNORMAJEAN That way. West. On foot. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT \nThe GTO THUNDERS past. \nINT. GTO - NIGHT \nPiper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat. She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow, looks at the jacket covering her. Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky. Piper looks. The MOON hangs a few days from full. Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her, then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold. \nMILTON Want me to roll the window up? \nPIPER You didn't kill him did you? \nMILTON No but he'll likely piss blood for a day or two. \nPIPER Thanks for that. \nMILTON Hungry? He gestures through the windshield as they pass a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome to Utah\u00e2\u0080\u009d sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead. \nPIPER Utah? \nMILTON You mentioned San Francisco. \nPIPER Appreciate what you done for me back there but I ain't takin you all the way to-- \nMILTON --My business is in Nevada.

You're Piper, right? \nPIPER You try to kill me and dump me in the desert I'll cut your nuts off. \nMILTON Fair enough. \nINT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT \nPool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS, COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them. Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight. ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy looking fucker, owns the joint. \nGREASY FELLA Greetings folks, welcome to the Bull by the Balls... He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape. \nMILTON Roy. \nROY Milton? Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton. \nROY Thought you were dead. \nMILTON You hoped I was dead. Not the same. \nROY You planning on staying? Milton eyes a door marked \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotel Guests\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \nMILTON Got a problem with that? \nROY Your money's good as any I\u00e2\u0080\u0098spect. But be gone by dawn. With Roy turns his back on them and walks away. \nPIPER What was that all about? \nMILTON Back in another life I used to drive a truck through these parts. \nPIPER And you'd spend the night here? \nMILTON I'd spend the night here fucking his wife. Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar. \nPIPER What's wrong? \nMILTON I...nothing I guess. A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton. \nCANDY Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you off with some drinks? \nMILTON Beer. \nPIPER Same. Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table. \nCANDY And I'll need to see your IDs. Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins filling out the card. \nMILTON What is this? \nPIPER Guess it's been awhile since you drove that truck through here. \n", "test1_id": 1467, "test2_input": "THROUGH WINDSHEILD There's nowhere to go! \nMILTON Shotgun! Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it out the window and -- \nEXT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nQUICKFIRES three blasts! \nEXT. MACK TRUCK - TRAILER HITCH - DAY \nThe hydraulics line BURSTS! Hydraulic fluid bleeds like a stuck jugular! The metal brackets holding the trailer in place...RELEASE! \nEXT. MACK TRUCK - DAY \nTruck and Flatbed separate! The back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser. The front flips around. \nINT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nThe Nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer! And then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers and tears onto the bridge! \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY \nCap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova! \nCAP Hurry! After them! Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as \nSCRRREEEECH. The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the blacktop. Driver's side angled back at the bridge. Every gun in the area spins as the driver's side door opens. The Accountant steps out, big smile on his face. \nCLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP \nSARGE You want us to shoot out his tires? \nON ACCOUNTANT As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air. The surrounding Troopers stare. The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and forefinger for all to see. \nPOV FROM TROOPERS He's holding an FBI badge in the air. \nCAP No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way in God's good heaven are you a... The Accountant steps down, thrusting his \u00e2\u0080\u0098badge' into Cap's face stopping him cold. \nACCOUNTANT Need you boys to stand down. Captain, you know what this badge means, right? Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant. Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes. \nACCOUNTANT Federal Bureau of get the fuck outta my way. You boys have blundered into an on-going Federal case. Now, lower your... He stops, turns...sniffs the air. His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER. \nACCOUNTANT You. ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it. Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper. The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused. \nSuddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside, snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping two buttons. \nYOUNG-FACED TROOPER Hey, Hey!!! Cap! And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo. \nACCOUNTANT It seems you're serving two masters. The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice. \n", "test2_true": "CAP Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now! Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY \nWe tear West down the highway as we catch up to the Nova and dive down...toward the back glass until -- \nINT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nPiper stares through the back window. \nPIPER I don't think...why aren't they following us? Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face. \nMILTON They're likely scared of you. \nPIPER Now what? \nMILTON Now we drive. \nWe pull back... \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY \n...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up. Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT \nSuddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a rocky outcropping in the distance. We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches above the cracked earth...we come to a stop. \nFOOM A BOOT slams into view. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT \nMilton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER. Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared. Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in and grabs his shotgun. \nMILTON Stay here. Piper nods. Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton moves toward a cliff's edge. \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT \nMilton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge. \nMILTON'S POV \nA twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's, rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal. And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one. Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits like a mobile command post. \nCLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty down there. Fuck. \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT \nMilton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty? Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face! He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead. \n", "test2_id": 1468, "test3_input": "ACCOUNTANT Hold on tight. It has quite a kick. \nPIPER If I kill you, you can't take him. \nACCOUNTANT Someone else will come...someone else always comes. Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below. \nACCOUNTANT Piper, he didn't steal that gun to kill me. He stole it to slow me down. He's getting what he wanted. Now, go to him. Before it's too late. Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path. \nINT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nMilton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nDucking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep \nCONTROL UNTIL: Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it - \nThe NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an oil derrick. The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips from the wreck. Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door. Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground, reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open. \nKA-FOOM! Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast! \nJONAH KING Kill him! Jonah and his men open FIRE! \nINT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nMilton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nJonah and his men draw closer and closer. \nTHEIR POV Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open driver's side door. \nPIPER (O.S.) \nHEY! The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger. \nKAFOOM! Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun jerked from her hands. She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her. \nThe GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND: \nKABLAAAAM! The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five. JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the wreck of the Nova. \nJONAH KING Well...this has all gone to shit. He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the Nova's open driver's side door. \nHIS POV Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone. Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find... Milton crawling. Bleeding. \nMILTON'S POV Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick. The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms. Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won. He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin. \nJONAH KING You lose. \n(LOOKS UP) Get over here! Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge. \n", "test3_true": "JONAH KING \n(TO MILTON) Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just know I promise to kill her slowly. \nJonah raises the barrel to Milton's forehead then... Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT. Jonah turns, stares. The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks. At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby. He was crawling toward the ancient revolver. He snatches it, rolls onto his back as-- Jonah swings his gun toward Milton -- \nKAFOOM! The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE! Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame. The Accountant moves away, watching as -- The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova. \nTHE GAS IGNITES FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King. \nANOTHER ANGLE Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face. \nPIPER Milton?! He lies on his back several yards away. Piper rushes up, falls beside him. He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand. \nANOTHER ANGLE Skanky Gal looks up to find... ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms. \nShe hands him the baby. \nACCOUNTANT I'm curious. Would you have let him do it? She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing... \nACCOUNTANT That's what I thought. He turns and walks away from her. \nACCOUNTANT See you. Soon. Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness. \nON MILTON AND PIPER \nPIPER Milton...no... Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick around. Searching. \nMILTON Where...where is she? \nACCOUNTANT She's here. The Accountant hands the baby to Milton. Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes. Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way. He places her in Piper's arms. \nMILTON Keep her safe. \nPIPER I will. Anyone tries to hurt her and I'll kill'em. \nMILTON I know. That's why I chose you. \nA HORN BLARES. They all turn toward the high cliff. \nTHEIR POV WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro. \nMILTON Webster will look after you both. As long as he can. And he'll keep trying long after he can't. \nPIPER Milton. This can't...you can't just give up. There's gotta be something we can do to... \nMILTON Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna happen. I'm askin more than I have a right to. I know it. But love her for me, Piper. Love her and make her yours. I don't have any right to ask for your promise... \nPIPER \n(WITHOUT HESITATION) I promise. Milton. I promise. Milton coughs. \n", "test3_id": 1469}

{"train": "DRIVE ANGRY \nWritten by \nTodd Farmer & Patrick Lussier \nMarch 28, 2009 \nEXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY \nHalf a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a ghost town \u00e2\u0080\u0098cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea how long ago this place went dry. Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending PLUMES of dust skyward. \nINT. OLD CHEVY - DAY \nThree grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab. FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron. \nFUCKING DRIVER Goddamned old man! \nFUCKING PASSENGER I thought he was dead! She said he was dead! \nFUCKING MIDDLE I don't see him. Just go. I think we lost him. \nEXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY \nThey race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for the main road in the distance when they round a corner -- --to face a \u00e2\u0080\u009870 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before: \nMILTON \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Old Man\u00e2\u0080\u009d, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner, locks the tires and spins the wheel. The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM! The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would \nBUT: MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window. Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES! \nThe shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN - Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it: TITLE CARD appears-- \n\"DRIVE ANGRY\" --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the words right at us! \nANOTHER ANGLE ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up, SLAMS the windshield. Truck CAREENS out of control! Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but... KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel. Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust SWIRLS around the two vehicles. The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front! The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING. \nANOTHER ANGLE Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open. Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy. Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes Milton, tire iron held high over his head! Milton spins and KUH-FOOM! --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and -- \nKER-ACK! -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard. Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out. \nOVER MILTON'S SHOULDER Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to his feet and runs. \nMilton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement. \nANOTHER ANGLE As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the windshield. He looks up -- -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat. \nFUCKING MIDDLE I'll never tell you where they've taken her...NEVER. \nMILTON I know. The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face. \nON FUCKING DRIVER As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up at Milton standing over him. \nFUCKING DRIVER You...you took my leg you fuck! Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee. \nFAT LOU Let...go...of...my... She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand. \nPIPER Shut up. She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his nuts. He has no choice but follow. She pulls him up to the American Indian family. \nPIPER Tell'em. \nFAT LOU Wha...what? We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go wide...flutter...he's about to pass out. \nPIPER Tell them...the muffins...are on the house. \nFAT LOU On. The. House. She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the floor as Piper turns to the family. The children are huddled, terrified against their parents. \nPIPER I'm sorry your kids had to see that. Put some honey butter on those bran muffins and they taste an awful lot better. Piper turns and crosses toward the door. NormaJean is pale as she watches her go. Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but Milton is gone. \nEXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY \nWe're close on a car door as it SLAMS. CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with life. An \u00e2\u0080\u009cI brake for pussy\u00e2\u0080\u009d bumper sticker stands out. THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within. \nINT. GTO - DAY \nPiper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY \nWith Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway... ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag thrown over his shoulder. \nINT. GTO - DAY \nPiper SINGS. She's empowered. Then... \nKA-THUNK. She grips the wheel. The RPMS drop. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY \nThe GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath the hood. CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS. Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack shit about engines. FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready. Milton appears through the smoke. \nMILTON Car trouble? Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing. Milton glances at the engine. \nMILTON Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix that for you if you like. \nPIPER I would. Thank you. \nMILTON If you give me a lift. \nPIPER I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls. The truckstop there. \nMILTON And I'd be much obliged. Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the hood shut with a smile. \nMILTON Shall we? \nINT. GTO - DAY \nPiper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper. Suddenly Piper turns on him. \nINT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY \nPiper stuffs a gym bag with clothes. \nFRANK Now baby, just hold on. \nPIPER I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come near me. \nFRANK Look, sooner you accept this is your fault, the better. Piper stops, turns, stares. \nFRANK Baby, I can't just turn it off. Now you know that. I gotta have it. At least once a day. It's in the wiring. You did this. You made me cheat on you. You're lucky I'm not more pissed about it. Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door. \nFRANK Piper! Now cut it out. Enough with the drama! \nINT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nMilton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear is a fake out. Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around. \nHIS POV \nTHE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70 ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him, quickly backs into the shadows. \nFRANK (O.S.) Piper! \nEXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY \nPiper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures of her. Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall where it SHATTERS. \nASIAN MAN Hey?! \nPIPER Pervert. Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her. \nFRANK Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we talk about this? Piper keeps walking. Never looks back. \nFRANK Piper, stop this! You got nowhere to go and you know it. \nPIPER I'll go to San Francisco and stay with my cousin. \nFRANK (Realization) Whoa. You ain't taking my car. Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger. \nFRANK I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch. Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and -- \nWHAM! -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank stumbles, nearly goes down. \nPIPER Your car?! Who's been making the payments you out of work, skanky Mona fucking piece of shit?! She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation. Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM! \nFRANK Stop... \nWHAM! \nFRANK ...hitting me! \nShe swings but this time Frank lashes out. \nACCOUNTANT I'm looking for someone. An old man. White hair. Five-eleven. The Accountant smells the air, embraces it. \nACCOUNTANT He was here earlier. Traveling light. Likely on foot. \nFAT LOU Who are you? \nACCOUNTANT I'm the Accountant. \nFAT LOU That's supposed to mean something to me? \nACCOUNTANT It will if I add you to the books. And if you don't tell me what I want to know... NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it. \nThe Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a step back. \nACCOUNTANT You had something to say? \nNORMAJEAN He was here. Earlier. \nACCOUNTANT Yes. We've established that. \nNORMAJEAN Terrible tipper. \nACCOUNTANT I'm sure he was. Where did he go? She points. \nNORMAJEAN That way. West. On foot. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT \nThe GTO THUNDERS past. \nINT. GTO - NIGHT \nPiper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat. She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow, looks at the jacket covering her. Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky. Piper looks. The MOON hangs a few days from full. Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her, then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold. \nMILTON Want me to roll the window up? \nPIPER You didn't kill him did you? \nMILTON No but he'll likely piss blood for a day or two. \nPIPER Thanks for that. \nMILTON Hungry? He gestures through the windshield as they pass a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome to Utah\u00e2\u0080\u009d sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead. \nPIPER Utah? \nMILTON You mentioned San Francisco. \nPIPER Appreciate what you done for me back there but I ain't takin you all the way to-- \nMILTON --My business is in Nevada. Can you get me that far? \nPIPER What business? \nCANDY You want a drink? You gotta be a member. Dry county. \nMILTON You're kidding. \nCANDY Welcome to Utah, Mr... \nShe takes his license. \nMILTON Call me Milton. \nCANDY This license isn't just expired. It's an antique. \nMILTON Fine, then bring me a milk. She tosses his card on the table. \nCANDY For you, gorgeous, we'll break the rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody. Milton watches her go. Drinking her up. \nPIPER You gonna tap that? \nMILTON Tap what? \nPIPER Jeez, Milton, how long's it been? Sounds like you used to stick it in anything with a crack. \nMILTON Yeah. Well. I've been distracted. \nPIPER Suit yourself. But nobody reaches the end and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWish I hadn't fucked so much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles. Piper slides from the booth. \nMILTON Where are you...? \nPIPER I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot bath and sleep in a warm bed. \nMILTON What about your beer? \nPIPER You drink it. See you at dawn. But she walks right passed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotel Guests\u00e2\u0080\u009d door and approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her. As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor. He glances at Milton then -- \nJONAH KING It's Roy isn't it? Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile. \nROY Sure is. Get you a drink friend? \nJONAH KING Fantastic place you have here. You don't happen to rent it out for parties do you? \nROY We sure do. You planing a party? Again Jonah glances at Milton. \nJONAH KING Oh yes. Tonight, in fact. \nINT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - NIGHT \nThe Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive footage of him preaching, warm, friendly. \nFRANK TV NEWS Mom...Mom...Mom! Would you Reverend Jonah King, the self- shut up and listen?! I've proclaimed prophet whose lost her for good this time. church has come under fire She's gone. I just want my for his anti-establishment car back.

End of have recently learned that story. She ain't coming King had a prior relationship back. Mom...mom...Mom! with one of the deceased. \nKNOCK KNOCK \nFRANK I gotta go. Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find -- The Accountant smiling at him. \nA NOISE Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just in time to see-- \nMAN WITH SICKLE enter! He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton. The glare becomes fear. Milton's already aiming the 357, then -- \nCLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and-- \nKUR-RUNCH! The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes down from above and behind. Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling the hockey stick...her face pale. \nMILTON Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad. Milton stares down into Candy's face. Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and opens her eyes. \nCANDY Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck I've ever had. Piper crosses to the adjoining room. \nCANDY Hello? Do you mind?! We're... Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room. \nPIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming. \nPIPER Aw, hell. Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357. \nMILTON I definitely got their attention. \nPIPER What. The fuck? You know these people? Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder. \nMILTON Come on. There are probably more. \nEXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT \nJonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses toward the Driver's side door... The gym bag starts to CRY. \nJONAH KING Shhhh. Don't cry little precious. FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut. Jonah King turns, freezes. Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser, staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag. For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career maker. News. Media. Leno. Then-- The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag. \nACCOUNTANT Troopers. Remember why we're here. He walks by them towards the front door of the bar. Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building. Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the gym bag, engine ROARS to life. \nEXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT \nMilton and Piper exit into the back lot. \nPIPER Milton, I'm serious! I want some answers! \nThey turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As it disappears behind the barn it reveals -- --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within. \nMILTON Yeah, we both want some answers. Milton moves toward the barn as-- The State Troopers walk around the bar. Everyone freezes. The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper. Recognition. \nMILTON Aw fuck. Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the Troopers as they go for their guns. \nMILTON Come on! Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire! The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and shoot back! \nFFFUMP! Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles, falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes spilling from within. \nPIPER No! The Troopers keep FIRING! Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter. We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry. She reaches for it. \nMILTON No! Not that one. He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without hesitation, rises and -- \nKUPOW! Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear! Both men crash to the ground. Dead. \nMILTON Sons of bitches killed my daughter. Piper stares. Milton steadies himself. \nMILTON So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm gonna get her back and I'm gonna kill every last one of the fuckers. \n(A BEAT) You want out, I'll understand. Piper considers, then -- \nKUH-FWAM! They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended. \nEXT. GTO - NIGHT \nIt's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits behind the wheel. \nINT. GTO - NIGHT \nMilton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin! \nMILTON In the back seat. Now. \nPIPER What? Why? \nMILTON Now! Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the cruiser pull up along side him. \nMILTON Shotgun. It's already loaded. Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the front seat. \nMILTON Have the other one ready. Not the 357. The OLD one. \nTHROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton. Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel through the passenger window. \nBOOOM! \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe cruiser's driver's side window explodes. \nINT. GTO - NIGHT \nMILTON'S POV \nThe Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder. When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across. \nACCOUNTANT It's over, Milton. Stop the car. \nMILTON I can't do that. \nACCOUNTANT Really? What makes you think you have a choice? \nMILTON I got something I gotta do first. \nACCOUNTANT Then you should have done it a long time ago. \nMILTON I didn't have to do it a long time ago! \nACCOUNTANT Milton, I will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you. \nMILTON Someone else. \nPIPER Is there anyone not trying to kill you? Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then -- \nPIPER Come on. I'll help you. But we're dealing with that first? She points to his blood soaked shirt. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT \nThe GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky. \nINT. GTO - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER The needle hovers at 95 mph. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads. \nMILTON My daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college. \nPIPER She knew him? She knew Jonah King, the man they think killed... She stops herself. \nMILTON She knew him. The world was in a fuckin tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution. He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357. \nMILTON It was four months before she realized \u00e2\u0080\u0098quiet' meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off chickens. \nPIPER Jonah King was into voodoo? Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically. \nMILTON Voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn't into. When she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. Gassed up her car. Cooked her a hot meal. Then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron. \nPIPER Jesus. She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands. \nMILTON She learned her lessen. Was a good little follower for eighteen months. That's when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown. It was Chinese New Year so the place was wall to wall slants. She saw her chance, stabbed Jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd. \nPIPER Milton. Your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didn't know? Why didn't you help her? Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight. His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber. \nMILTON I didn't find out about any of this until...until I got locked up. Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut. Shoves it into his duffle. \nPIPER Not gonna reload? \nMILTON Only had three bullets to begin... \nPIPER Milton. \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an accident. Milton eases the shotgun into his lap. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN \nSeveral vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is overturned on the shoulder. \nINT. GTO - DAWN \nPIPER That's his truck. \nMILTON Stay put. I won't be long. \nJONAH KING Put the blonde in the RV. Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and Business woman climb in with the baby. Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face. \nMILTON I'm only gonna make this offer once. Give me my granddaughter and I'll let you liv-- \nKAPOW! He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton's head snaps, he falls to the ground on his back. \nPIPER No!!! Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV. \nINT. RV - DAWN \nSkanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman. \nBUSINESS WOMAN Please. Try something. \nJonah climbs into the RV, closes the door. \nJONAH KING Let's go. \nPIPER You killed him! You bastard you -- \nWHACK! Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her. \nBUSINESS WOMAN Next time I shoot that mouth right off your face. Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS rising behind him. \nJONAH'S POV Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN \nMan With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels. Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as the others join him. They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the bullet entered. \nMILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES. Everyone stares. Did they just see that right? \nTHE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES! The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back. The others recoil. Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges Milton with the ax. MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357! \nBurly's blown back! The others scatter as Milton staggers to his feet! He grabs the shotgun, leans on it for support. \nON GTO AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door. \nANOTHER ANGLE MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with the scoped hunting rifle. Aims. BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off. Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig back behind the wagon. \nINT. GTO - DAWN \nMilton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE \nMan with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle. Moves into the road. Can't see Milton in the car, but that doesn't matter. He knows he's there. \nBLAM. \nINT. GTO - DAWN \nThe windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He reaches for the keys. \nINT. RV - DAY \nJonah glances through the back window. Double takes. \nHIS POV A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway, gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When Jonah speaks...it is with wonder. \nJONAH KING Look at this. He's still coming. \nTATTOO Who's still coming? \nJONAH KING The old man. He's alive. \nTATTOO AND PIPER What? Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her! \nBUSINESS WOMAM Stay down! That's impossible! \nTATTOO You shot him in the face! He can't-- \nJONAH KING Don't you see? We stand at the crossroads! Did you think we would just idly change the world? The forces of evil challenge us! This is wonderful! We show ourselves to be worthy. I'm so very proud of each one of you. Tattoo and Business Woman beam. Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The kid goes quiet as -- The back glass SHATTERS. Everyone ducks! \nEXT. GTO - DAY \nMilton leans out the driver's side with the shotgun in his left hand, his one good eye squinting as -- \nKAFOOM! He fires at the RV! He RATCHETS another shell into the chamber, takes aim then...hesitates... \nIN REARVIEW The front end of a fast approaching vehicle! \nWHAM! \nMilton's head snaps back as a 90 Corvette slams into the back of the GTO. \nEXT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY \nLady in Leopardskin behind the wheel, her eyes insane. Behind the Corvette we see a \u00e2\u0080\u009892 Lincoln, Thin Old Man driving. Truck Driving Woman in a \u00e2\u0080\u009895 Viper. \nINT. GTO - DAY \nMilton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles to keep the big GTO on the road. Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not. \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD The RV pulls off the road to the left. Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off. \nMILTON Shit! He SLAMS on his brakes. \nINT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY \nLeopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks the wheel. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - THE CHASE - DAY \nThe Corvette slams into the side of the Viper! The Lincoln cuts hard right. All three cars shoot pass the GTO. Milton cuts the wheel left and floors it! \nINT. RV - DAY \nPiper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand around her throat! Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away from him...she can no longer dig into his face. Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping. Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck. She claws his shirt open. And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew. Chinese in design. She snatches it and -- \nSHUNK! Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in. He SCREAMS. Releasing her! \nEXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY \nQuiet. \nFOOM! GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the ground ten feet! The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES! Milton JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest! \nThe GTO jerks backwards...climbing toward the top of the hill in reverse when Milton SNAPS the wheel. The GTO 180s, comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop. Milton casually leans out of the driver's side window with the shotgun in hand. He points it skyward as-- \nFOOM! The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop...and passes directly over the top of Milton. Milton's one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank beneath the back of the car. Milton squeezes the trigger. The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as -- --The Corvette rockets over the hilltop! \nINT. CORVETTE - DAY \nLady in Leopardskin's face drops. \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her! Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as -- \nEXT.

GTO - DAY \nMilton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off toward the RV. \nINT. RV - DAY \nJonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It won't budge. He glares at Piper. \nShe scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella from a coat rack. It'll have to do... There's a machete hanging beneath it. She drops the umbrella grabs the machete.

RV - DAY \nPiper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as -- Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides right up to him. He snatches it. Piper leaps through the door. \nINT. GTO - DAY \nMilton is gaining as -- \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD Piper swings out, clinging to the door for dear life! \nEXT. RV - DAY \nPiper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately to hold on as -- Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand. \nMILTON I know, baby. I know. Jonah only had about twenty followers. We hurt him good today. \nPIPER Fuckin devil worshipers freak me out. They mess with powers that should be left alone. Turns my shit white. \nMILTON Powers. It's all bullshit. \nPIPER No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit. The Devil and demons? Once those doors are opened you're fucked. Milton rolls his one good eye. Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine. \nPIPER What do we do now? \nMILTON I used to know a guy lived out this way. You got one of them portable phones? \nPIPER Portable phones? You mean a cell phone? Yeah, in my bag. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAY \nWE ARE CLOSE ON THE CRACKED EARTH As a hand slams into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails curl...dig into the ground. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL Man With Wig crawls toward us. He's pale. Eyes dim. \nPULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL \nHis busted, mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and fluid stretching back to the highway. Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He drags himself forward a few inches. \nHIS POV He's crawling toward the Station Wagon. Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING Wig turns, squints. \nA SILHOUETTE APPROACHES Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step. Wig holds his hand out to the savior as-- The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear. \nACCOUNTANT Scorcher today, huh? He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle. \nMAN WITH WIG Help me... \nACCOUNTANT Christ on a cracker. My apologies. The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into a sitting position. Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above his left breast. \nACCOUNTANT What's that supposed to mean? \nMAN WITH WIG It's a symbol of our pact with Lord Satan. \nACCOUNTANT Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's never mentioned you. Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices. \nACCOUNTANT Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have some water. Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him. \nACCOUNTANT Milton's work I take it? \nMAN WITH WIG Ran me over with his...how do you...? Who are you? \nACCOUNTANT I'm the Accountant. I'm curious. And I never get curious. What do you people want with Milton? \nMAN WITH WIG You're the who? The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly shattered femur and squeezes. Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS. \nACCOUNTANT Does it matter? Milton. Why is he important to you? \nMAN WITH WIG He isn't! He's the one chasing us! \nPIPER Back? Back from where? What. The Fuck. Are you two talking about?! \nWEBSTER It true they took the little one? Milton nods. Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44. \nWEBSTER Put her in neutral. I'll pull the truck around. But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton. \nEXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY \nPolice tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell. Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing. He scans the ground. His eyes go even wider. \nROOKIE Sarge! Sarge look at this! Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin, approaches, stares, frowns. \nSARGE Yeah? \nROOKIE Cigarette butt. \nSARGE I see that. \nROOKIE Sarge! It's less than twenty feet from the victims! \nSARGE And less than three feet from the ash bin. Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred cigarette butts salute the sky. \nSARGE Pay attention, Rookie. But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere. \nROOKIE Hey! \nHIS POV CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans, cowboy boots, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDumbledore Dies On Page 596\u00e2\u0080\u009d sweatshirt. His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are all business. \nROOKIE You! You can't be here! Rookie rushes forward. \nSARGE Rookie! \nROOKIE Sarge, this joker can't just stomp around the crime scene. Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap. \nSARGE Captain. Sorry about that. Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet. \nCAP One of yours? \nSARGE Yessir, I won't let it happen again. \nCAP Get him out of here. \nSARGE Cap, he's green, that's all. \nCAP He's standing on evidence. Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings. Cap kneels, stares. \nCAP \nSuddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar. \nUNIFORMED OFFICER Cap! We got a live one. \nINT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY \nThe sun's setting to the West. Milton stands dangerously close to the fire. Stares at the dancing flames. \nWEBSTER (O.S.) That fire makin you homesick? Piper and Webster approach with a six pack. \nWEBSTER Cold beer? Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close. The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it. \nMILTON You know the pain and suffering ain't the worse part, right? That's what they tell ya, what they want you to believe. But it's all a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst part's the goddamn video feed. Webster and Piper exchange a glance. \nMILTON It ain't about the fire and brimstone. Ain't about your suffering. It's about the suffering of them you love. Cuz you see it. You see it all. In full goddamn detail. And there ain't nothin you can do about it. Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air. \nMILTON Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like one of them tree-huggin piece of shits. Wore sandals. What kind of man wears fuckin sandals? \n(MORE) \nMILTON (CONT'D) \n(A BEAT) But I saw how he died. Fought like a fuckin banshee. Milton goes quiet. \nMILTON He loved that daughter of mine. Loved that little baby too. He kept fightin long after he should'a been dead. But some people's better at killin than others. Just how they're wired. Milton's finding it harder to speak. \nMILTON Then them sons of bitches turned on my...nosir, physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em all. And...and then I'll be done. Milton finally goes silent. Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her cheeks. She's trying not to sob. Webster looks steely. Determined. \nWEBSTER Milton, I can't fix that car. But I can get you were you need to be. \nINT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - NIGHT \nA huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a 1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles. \nWEBSTER Milt, if memory serves you were always partial to the Nova, yes? \nEXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DISTANT RIDGE - NIGHT \nWe're staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we hear the GLASS-PACKED RUMBLE of the Nova's engine. \nMOVE TO REVEAL \nJONAH standing on the ridge top, cell phone to his ear. \nJONAH KING Yeah, about that fella who killed all them people at the Bull by the Balls last night. The fella who killed two of your cops. I know where you can find him. \nEXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN \nThe sun rises to the east burning off the Utah dew. \nINT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - CAR STALL - DAWN \nMilton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares. \nHIS POV Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat. \nMILTON What are you doing? Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry. \nPIPER Fuck are you doing?! Milton stares. \nPIPER I never knew him. Momma said he was a drifter. \nMILTON I ain't your daddy. \nPIPER Fuck you if you are. Milton notices something in the rear view. \nMILTON Shit. Piper sits up, stares. \nTHROUGH BACK GLASS There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast. \nPIPER What do we do? \nMILTON Nothing yet. Not until... The lights come on. \nPIPER Oh shit. They know. \nMILTON We can't stop. Milton mashes the peddle to the floor. \nPIPER Milton, this will never work. \nMILTON It'll work. \nPIPER No. It won't. Nobody gets away anymore. In fifteen minutes there will be choppers, we'll be all over the news... She breaks off. Her mouth drops. \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line the side of the road. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY \nTwenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their vehicles, shotguns and assault rifles in hand. \nCap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a radio to his mouth. \nCAP Just keep driving him to us. We'll do the rest. And make sure you peel off before the fireworks. He lowers the handset, addresses the men. \nCAP Gentlemen, these two killed two of our own. I know you'd like them to pay. Therefore, when I tell you to aim for the tires, what I mean is aim for their heads. Are we clear? The men nod with steely determination. \nCAP Very good. Please aim for the tires. \nINT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nThe barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned. \nPIPER Just don't stop. \nMILTON Too many of them. \nPIPER Just keep driving. \nMILTON I'm...I'm sorry I got you into-- \nPIPER --They took your granddaughter, Milton, and now these badge-wearing fuckers are trying to stop you. You crawled out of the Goddamn abyss...and a few fat-assed county Mounties are giving you pause? Your grand-baby needs you. Milton nods. Turns back to the road. \nPIPER You know what happens to her if they stop us. \nHIS POV Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant. \nMILTON Get away from her. \nACCOUNTANT I think not. \nMILTON I shoot you with this, you know what it means. No heaven. No hell. You cease to exist. \nACCOUNTANT All the more reason to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity. You are old, Milton. You might miss again. \nMILTON You can't stop me. \nACCOUNTANT Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful shit. That roadblock back there, that would have stopped you. So I want you to drop that iron God- Killer and say thank you. Milton stares. The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick, suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS. \nACCOUNTANT I said, drop it and thank you. Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the darkness behind him. \nMILTON Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you. \nACCOUNTANT That's better. He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close. \nACCOUNTANT You're not the first to get out and I doubt you'll be the last but I gotta know, HOW did you get out with the God-Killer? \nMILTON \n(CHUCKLES) I just walked in and took it. \nACCOUNTANT You did not. \nMILTON I'm an old washed up lifer. Never occurred to'em that I was up to no good. \nACCOUNTANT Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds out. \nMILTON What's he gonna do? Not let me back in? Now, I gotta know. Why? Why help me? \nPIPER I know why. It's because of those crazy fucks out there isn't it? They figured something out didn't they? Somehow they know how to summon a piece of hell to earth. The Accountant laughs. \nACCOUNTANT That's cute. You haven't told her? \nMILTON She don't listen. \nACCOUNTANT Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a little secret. The Dark Lord? Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply the warden of a very large prison. Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful. Well read. I happen to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly. \nMILTON Then why? Why help me? \nACCOUNTANT Simple. Like the warden, we all have jobs to do. Getting you here makes my job easier. You get what you want, I get what I want. \nMILTON Then help me, now. There are forty of them down there. You and I could-- \nACCOUNTANT --No. \nMILTON \nBUT-- \nACCOUNTANT Hold on tight. It has quite a kick. \nPIPER If I kill you, you can't take him. \nACCOUNTANT Someone else will come...someone else always comes. Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below. \nACCOUNTANT Piper, he didn't steal that gun to kill me. He stole it to slow me down. He's getting what he wanted. Now, go to him. Before it's too late. Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path. \nINT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nMilton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nDucking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep \nCONTROL UNTIL: Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it - \nThe NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an oil derrick. The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips from the wreck. Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door. Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground, reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open. \nKA-FOOM! Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast! \nJONAH KING Kill him! Jonah and his men open FIRE! \nINT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nMilton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT \nJonah and his men draw closer and closer. \nTHEIR POV Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open driver's side door. \nPIPER (O.S.) \nHEY! The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger. \nKAFOOM! Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun jerked from her hands. She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her. \nThe GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND: \nKABLAAAAM! The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five. JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the wreck of the Nova. \nJONAH KING Well...this has all gone to shit. He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the Nova's open driver's side door. \nHIS POV Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone. Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find... Milton crawling. Bleeding. \nMILTON'S POV Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick. The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms. Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won. He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin. \nJONAH KING You lose. \n(LOOKS UP) Get over here! Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge. \n", "test1_input": "PIPER Did...did you just throw scrambled eggs at us? \nFAT LOU I don't pay you bitches to stand around. Now get the fuck back to work! Piper snatches one of the plates. She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns toward the newly arrived customers. The American Indian couple scans a menu... ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as -- NormaJean steps up to Milton. \nNORMAJEAN Hello beautiful, coffee? \nMILTON That'd be great. Tell me, Stillwater Marsh around here? \nNORMAJEAN (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring a bell. I'll get that coffee. But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother. She quickly looks away. She knows something... Milton opens his mouth to speak as-- --Piper approaches the American Indian couple. \nPIPER Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring you something to drink? \nMOTHER MARY We'll take this. \nMary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads. \nPIPER \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's a Brickhouse\u00e2\u0080\u009d breakfast. Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99. \nMOTHER MARY And five waters. \nPIPER Five waters. And what can I get for... Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed. \nMOTHER MARY That's it. Just the pancakes. If that's okay? Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit... they're hungry. And broke. \nPIPER Oh. Of course. Coming right up. Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen. Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's attention. She's ignoring him. Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou. \nPIPER One brickhouse. She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins kept fresh within a glass cake stand. \nANOTHER ANGLE Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare. \nMILTON Stillwater Marsh? You know it? Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks. \nDALE No. We don't. \nMILTON It's important. \nMOTHER MARY You're in the wrong state. \nDALE Mary! \nMILTON And what state Should I be in? Dale turns, glares at Milton. \nDALE Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across. It's a two day drive from here. \nMILTON And Wolf Deer Run? \nDALE Never heard of it. The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten. \nLITTLE GIRL Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run, that's where The Smiling Man takes the wicked children to see the Mother of all things. Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close. \nMILTON Mother of all things, that sounds very interesting. \nLITTLE GIRL Oh it is! The Mother of all things bleeds black tears unto those who \n", "test1_true": "MOTHER MARY It's nothing. Just a story parents tell to their children. Like the boogey-man or the tooth-fairy. A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper leans in with three kiddie cups. \nPIPER And three milks. \nMOTHER MARY But we didn't order-- \nPIPER (whispers) --On the house. She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She doesn't notice... \nMILTON staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face. Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him. \nNORMAJEAN So, aren't you gonna ask what time my shift ends? Full moon tonight. I'm always a little \u00e2\u0080\u0098randy' during full moon. \nMILTON Full moon's three days off. \nNORMAJEAN (she touches his hand) You sure \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout that, sweetie? \nMILTON Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell of a ride out there. Yours? \nNORMAJEAN The GTO? I wish. \nMILTON (glances at Piper) Hers? \nNORMAJEAN Sure but if you're lookin' for a ride... \nMILTON And would you be gentle? \nNORMAJEAN Life's too short for that, sweetie. \nINT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAY \nPiper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops them into a soapy sink. She turns right into -- \nFAT LOU He glares down at her. \nPIPER Jesus Lou, back the fuck off. \nFAT LOU \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the house\u00e2\u0080\u009d? On the fucking house? \nPIPER Oh relax.

HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY \nAs Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind, spins her around. \nPIPER Get your hand off of me! His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder. \nFAT LOU You get over there and you charge them for those muff... Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even hear the CRUNCH. Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her forehead into the bridge of his nose! \nKER-RACK! \nPIPER I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never to touch me again!

He's traveling with her. He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo. \nTROOPER #2 Excuse me? The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it. Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room. \nTROOPER #1 Jesus. He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant. \nTROOPER #1 Keep your hands where I can see them! \nACCOUNTANT Troopers, this is your lucky day. Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.

(to his partner) What's the matter with you?! Draw your weapon! \nTrooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until... The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at the two cops. \nACCOUNTANT Here. Look at this. They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it. \nTROOPER #1 You're... you're a Fed? \nACCOUNTANT In pursuit of a white haired man. John Milton. He's travelling with the girl in this picture. Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon. \nTROOPER #1 But, that guy, in the room. He's - \nACCOUNTANT --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying. World won't miss him. Look, troopers. I need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive. If we, we three, can apprehend him...you are ambitious, correct. \nTROOPER #2 I guess... \nTROOPER #1 Yes, we are... \nACCOUNTANT Wasn't actually a question. I can tell you are. Success will mean promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee it. Now we are going to hunt this Milton, we are going to find the GTO he's driving and when we find him, you will shoot to kill. You understand? Shoot. To. Kill. The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive. Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation. \nTROOPER #1 That's against protocol... \nACCOUNTANT This man is highly dangerous. He has killed and will kill again. He must be taken down on sight. The time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life.

At her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy. He's painting her toenails. On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER. The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then... \nBUSBOY Uh, are we gonna do it? \nPIPER Well, I don't know, baby. Depends on how well you do those nails. Now pay attention. You might need to redo that one. He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are starting to annoy the fuck out of her. She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall. \nPIPER Shut the fuck up in there! Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back. \nMILTON You shut the fuck up! That's it!

He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes. \n", "test2_id": 1468, "test3_input": "THROUGH WINDSHEILD There's nowhere to go! \nMILTON Shotgun! Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it out the window and -- \nEXT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nQUICKFIRES three blasts! \nEXT. MACK TRUCK - TRAILER HITCH - DAY \nThe hydraulics line BURSTS! Hydraulic fluid bleeds like a stuck jugular! The metal brackets holding the trailer in place...RELEASE! \nEXT. MACK TRUCK - DAY \nTruck and Flatbed separate! The back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser. The front flips around. \nINT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling. \nEXT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nThe Nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer! And then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers and tears onto the bridge! \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY \nCap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova! \nCAP Hurry! After them! Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as \nSCRRREEEECH. The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the blacktop. Driver's side angled back at the bridge. Every gun in the area spins as the driver's side door opens. The Accountant steps out, big smile on his face. \nCLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP \nSARGE You want us to shoot out his tires? \nON ACCOUNTANT As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air. The surrounding Troopers stare. The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and forefinger for all to see. \nPOV FROM TROOPERS He's holding an FBI badge in the air. \nCAP No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way in God's good heaven are you a... The Accountant steps down, thrusting his \u00e2\u0080\u0098badge' into Cap's face stopping him cold. \nACCOUNTANT Need you boys to stand down. Captain, you know what this badge means, right? Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant. Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes. \nACCOUNTANT Federal Bureau of get the fuck outta my way. You boys have blundered into an on-going Federal case. Now, lower your... He stops, turns...sniffs the air. His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER. \nACCOUNTANT You. ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it. Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper. The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused. \nSuddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside, snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping two buttons. \nYOUNG-FACED TROOPER Hey, Hey!!! Cap! And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo. \nACCOUNTANT It seems you're serving two masters. The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice. \n", "test3_true": "CAP Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now! Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY \nWe tear West down the highway as we catch up to the Nova and dive down...toward the back glass until -- \nINT. 69 NOVA - DAY \nPiper stares through the back window. \nPIPER I don't think...why aren't they following us? Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face. \nMILTON They're likely scared of you. \nPIPER Now what? \nMILTON Now we drive. \nWe pull back... \nEXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY \n...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up. Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT \nSuddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a rocky outcropping in the distance. We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches above the cracked earth...we come to a stop. \nFOOM A BOOT slams into view. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT \nMilton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER. Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared. Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in and grabs his shotgun. \nMILTON Stay here. Piper nods. Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton moves toward a cliff's edge. \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT \nMilton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge. \nMILTON'S POV \nA twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's, rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal. And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one. Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits like a mobile command post. \nCLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty down there. Fuck. \nEXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT \nMilton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty? Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face! He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead. \n", "test3_id": 1469}

MELIA So he hasn't actually forbidden you. 
ELEANOR Franklin doesn't forbid. He just feels it's a waste of my valuable ime to learn. Since I can't afford to buy a plane.

They share a look of such mutual understanding, neither has to smile. 
AMELIA The wrong Roosevelt got elected. 
ELEANOR And it will take at least four years to correct the mistake. Keeps eating. 
ELEANOR (CONT'D) I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet. It might be under the Bureau f Commerce. 
AMELIA I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it. Said casually, looking at her plate. 
ELEANOR My hearing is failing. I missed the words `or woman,' which you undoubtedly added after, or per- haps before, the word `man.' 
AMELIA his could be one of those rare instances. When the most accomplished candidate. Turns out to be male. Glances up for the reaction. 
ELEANOR How exciting. I love finding the exception that proves the rule. Is t a name I know? Amelia's straight gaze.   Her small smile. 
AMELIA How do you feel about flying at night? Eleanor's eyes register the change of topic.     Rolling with it... 
ELEANOR I've never done it.   Franklin finds t dangerous. 
AMELIA Outstanding. 
INT. CONDOR AIRLINER - LATER 
Raucous party in the small cabin, hosted by George and fueled 
by champagne. PAN slowly to... ..the cockpit. Amelia at the controls in her evening dress and formal gloves. Eleanor in the co-pilot's seat, awestruck by the brilliant starry night. Amelia glances over, moved by her friend's almost childlike wonder. AMELIA (softly) Put your hands on the wheel. Eleanor looks over.   Are you serious? 
AMELIA It's dual controls.   No one will ever know. Hesitation. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Don't you trust me? And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel.     Amelia's hands come away from hers. 
ELEANOR Dear God. The Condor purrs along through the night air. The moon bobs slightly off to one side. Eleanor's eyes are swimming with the thrill of this. 
AMELIA I feel like a Coke.   Can I get you something? And stands up. Only the trace of her smile as the pilot's eyes WIDEN in absolute shock. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Do try not to hit the ground. 
DISSOLVE TO... 
INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY 
A sea of press, quiet, poised, attentive.     REVERSE ANGLE to... 
Y 
...CLOSE on a seated Roosevelt before a bank of microphones. 
ROOSEVELT Today, we proudly announce an appointment critical to America's commerce, and to its role as technology's leader in the Twentieth Century. PAN to Gene at his side.   Sober.   Distinguished.   Proud. 
ROOSEVELT (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
G ene Vidal is an obvious and perfect choice as our first Director of Commerce's Aeronautics Branch. His extraordinary credentials include... 
DISSOLVE TO... 
EXT. PUTNAM HOME, RYE - EVENING 
A taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. Warmly lit, music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as yard lights go ON. As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to... George watching it all from the doorway.    His easy smile seems comfortably in place, as... ...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist, talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach the door... George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as Amelia leads them inside. The door closes.   We hear laughter.

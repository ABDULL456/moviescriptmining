Across the way, another sniper tumbles off his perch... 
TINK! 
...as does another... 
TINK! 
...and another... 
SNIPER (CONT'D) Where the fuck is he? 
TINK! 
...and another... 
The sniper searches, his skin wet with perspiration, hand trembling upon the stock. 
TINK! 
...and another, screaming as he falls... 
SNIPER (CONT'D) WHERE THE FUCK... (TRAILING OFF) 
The Sniper has found John... 
SNIPER (CONT'D) The old cannery. Southeast of my position. 
...but it is too late. 
WE ZOOM THROUGH HIS SCOPE... 
...ACROSS THE YARD... 
...AND INTO THE CANNERY WHERE JOHN LIES ON THE FLOOR WITH A SNIPER RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER. 
JOHN FIRES... 
...AND WE FOLLOW THE BULLET BACK UP TOWARDS THE SNIPER'S PERCH... 
...WHERE IT ENTERS THE SNIPER'S SCOPE... 
...AND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. 
His body goes limp... 
...and slides out of his perch, cart-wheeling down to the earth below. 
EXT. THE SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
EIGHT HEAVILY-ARMORED SUV's bear down on the old cannery building. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
John shifts position, aims, and fires- 
EXT. THE SHIPYARD - CONTINUOUS 
-but the round ricochets off the bulletproof window. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
John ejects the clip, ejects a round, leans the weapon against the window, and sinks back into the darkness. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
The parade of SUVs enter the cannery, their tires screeching to a stop as a swarm of highly-trained gunmen emerge, scattering throughout the building. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
John pries open the doors of an old, wooden, elevator shaft: now an empty cavern disappearing down into darkness. 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE TOP FLOOR - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
A pair of gunmen swiftly close in on John... 
INT. THE CANNERY - THE TOP FLOOR - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
...who takes a deep breath... 
...and jumps- 
-bullets riddling the doors behind him-

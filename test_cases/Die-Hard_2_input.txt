"DIE HARD" 
FADE IN 
1       405 FREEWAY - LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING              1 
Christmas tinsel on the light poles.  We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening. 
2       INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME                           2 
The usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece.  As the plane TAXIS to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings. 
3       ON JOHN MCCLANE                                        3 
mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip. He sits by the window.  His relief on landing is subtle, but we NOTICE.  Suddenly, he hears -- 
SALESMAN'S VOICE You don't like flying, do you? 
McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear. 
MCCLANE No, no, where'd you get that idea? 
SALESMAN (smiling) Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel?  After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes. 
MCCLANE Fists with your toes. 
SALESMAN Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes...I mean like this...work out that time zone tension. (demonstrating) Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag.  I know it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've been doing it for nine years. 
The plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead luggage.  McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the businessman BLANCHES seeing: 
3-A     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL                  3-A 
Peeking out from his jacket. 
3-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          3-B 
Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly. 
MCCLANE It's okay. (showing badge) I'm a cop. (pause) Trust me.  I've been doing it for eleven. 
The businessman relaxes, moves off.  McClane now wrestles down the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer.  Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat and an overnighter.  Barely managing all this, he turns, COLLIDING WITH: 
3-C     A PRETTY STEWARDESS                                    3-C 
She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look. 
STEWARDESS (smiling, about the bear) Maybe you should have bought her a ticket. 
MCCLANE Her? 
He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs. 
MCCLANE She doesn't complain. 
STEWARDESS (eying him) Neither would I. 
McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves down the aisle.

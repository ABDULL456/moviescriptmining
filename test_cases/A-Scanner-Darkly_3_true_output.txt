FRED Okay. 
Technician #4 flips a lever, the panel in front of Fred lights up, and we see a wide array of outline drawings: a hammer, a shoe, a seagull, a camel, etc. Then in rapid succession, photographic images of these objects and others flash before Fred's left eye. He tries to keep up. 
INT. ROOM 203 - A BIT LATER 
Fred, now with an eye patch over his left eye, faces a screen. On the table in front of him is a wide array of small objects: A toy boat, a die, a key, a marble, etc. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #4 Now, an image of a familiar object will be projected, you are to reach into the group of objects on the table in front of you, with your left hand -- and pick up the corresponding object. 
INT. ROOM 203 - A BIT LATER 
Fred is blindfolded, a box with hand-holes in front of him. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3 Next, you will reach into this box and touch the object inside with your left hand. After that you will be shown three objects visually. They will somewhat resemble each other and you will tell us which one most resembles the item you felt in the box. 
INT. ROOM 203 - A BIT LATER 
Fred sits with a pile of oddly shaped blocks, which he is attempting to fit into their corresponding holes. 
INT. ROOM 203 - LATER 
Fred sits before a table on which are scattered a bunch of identical plastic birds and one plastic lion. Fred studies the table, finally picking up one of the plastic birds. 
FRED This is the different one. 
Medical Technician #4 makes a note on his clipboard. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3 Okay, Fred, good. Let us process -- 
Fred looks up from the table at Medical Technician #3, who is now Medical Technician #2 from the previous scene. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 -- these test results. And we'll get back to you within a couple of hours. 
Medical Technician #4 is now Medical Technician #1. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Thanks for your cooperation, Fred. 
FRED Thank you.    Thank you all very much. 
INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT HALL - DAY 
Fred walks hurriedly through the hall, past other Scramble Suits and uniformed police personnel. He enters an office. 
INT. HANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Hank looks up from his desk. 
HANK Fred, is that you? 
FRED Yes. 
HANK Fred, this is the informant who phoned in about Bob Arctor. 
Hank indicates Jim Barris, sitting against the wall, grinning crazily and fiddling with a paper clip. 
HANK (CONT'D) We challenged him to appear in person and he did. Do you know him? 
FRED Sure I do. (to Barris) You're James Barris, aren't you? 
Barris continues to grin, says nothing. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HANK His i.d. shows him to be, yes. 
FRED What does he want? 
JIM BARRIS I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of a large, secret covert organization, well-funded, with arsenals of weapons at their disposal, probably dedicated to the overthrow -- 
HANK That part is speculation. We want to know what your firsthand evidence is. 
FRED Have you ever been in a mental hospital, Mr. Barris? 
JIM BARRIS No, I have not, sir, ever been in a -- 
FRED Will you sign a sworn notarized statement regarding your evidence? 
HANK He already has, Fred. 
JIM BARRIS My evidence, gentlemen, which I mostly don't have with me today, consits of tape recordings I have made of Robert Arctor's phone conversations. 
FRED What is this covert organization? 
JIM BARRIS I believe it to be political in nature, and against this country. 
FRED And what is Arctor's relationship to Substance D?

KID Okay. Good. I want a stuffed elephant. A pink one. 
WILLIE Yeah, well... 
He brushes past the kid into the house, eyes darting this way and that. 
WILLIE ...wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which fills up faster. 
KID Okay. 
The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out the house, bumping open doors, looking around. 
WILLIE I'm gonna be staying here a while. Things are all fucked up at the North Pole. Mrs. Santa, she... she walked in on me fuckin' her sister. So I'm out on my fuckin' ass. She's taking half of everything... This'll do. 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Willie has discovered the master bedroom, by appearances long unused. He tosses his grip onto the double bed. 
WILLIE ...I'm gonna crash here. You and me, like, you know, bachelors. 
KID Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids? 
WILLIE No. Thank the fuck Christ. 
KID What about the elves? 
WILLIE Yeah, well, them. They stay with Mrs. Santa. I get 'em on weekends. Run me a bath, will ya? 
KID What about the reindeer? 
WILLIE (pleading) Don't start with the fucking reindeer. 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The Kid sits on a stool, hands on his knees, staring, motionless. 
Finally: 
KID ...What're their names? 
Willie lies in the tub, also motionless, a wet washcloth over his face, fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. 
From under his washcloth: 
WILLIE ...Who? 
KID The elves. 
WILLIE (to himself) Oh, fuck... (then, to the Kid) I -- I can't remember... Sneezy, and Dopey -- 
KID That's the Seven Dwarves. 
WILLIE Shit, is that not...? I just -- fuck, I don't know, I'll just say, Hey, Bub -- Look, I... 
He drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the kid. 
WILLIE ...FUCK ME! I DON'T KNOW THIS FUCKING SHIT! WHY IS EVERYTHING A FUCKING TEST WITH YOU?! 
The Kid looks at him, unperturbed. 
KID -- How old are they? 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Willie staggers in, a towel around his waist, the empty rock glass in one hand, a bottle tucked under the other arm, the Kid trotting after. 
KID You want cookies?

MITCHELL (V.O.) --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard. 
BERNSTEIN Sir, I'd like to ask you a few-- 
MITCHELL (V.O.) --what time is it? 
BERNSTEIN 
MITCHELL (V.O.) Morning or night? 
BERNSTEIN Night. 
MITCHELL (V.O.) Oh. 
And he hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
BRADLEE and BERNSTEIN at BERNSTEIN's desk. BRADLEE is going over BERNSTEIN's notes. 
BRADLEE He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? (BERNSTEIN nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words "her tit" and run it. 
And now suddenly-- 
THE PRESSES OF THE POST 
rolling the story. They're modern and gigantic and 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic. 
BRADLEE comes up behind them, looks down at the presses, starts to talk. 
BRADLEE Once when I was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life... And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, "Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you." (shakes his head) I took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--" (looks at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN) --I screwed up but I wasn't wrong. 
They all watch the presses now. 
BRADLEE You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless? (as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN nod, BRADLEE starts away) You should be... 
CUT TO: 
THE PRESSES continuing to roll. The SOUND is incredible. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
A TELETYPE MACHINE 
clacking away like crazy. We can read the words, "The Senator finished by saying that although he was..." and from there-- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A SENATOR and while the words "although he was" are still very fresh in our minds-- 
SENATOR Although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- 
The SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang. The next two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE. The CREEP voice is very southern, the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer. The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R. SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP office doors and so identified. The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side. As the teletype goes on-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R. MAN 
CREEP P.R. MAN (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination. I can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation-- 
CUT TO: 
THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN 
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN --the White House has long since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain elements of the Eastern liberal press-- 
CUT TO: 
BRADLEE'S OFFICE 
A lot of activity. BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches. SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there, WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, too. A kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The editors look at it. 
SIMONS (reading) Same kind of crap-- 
BRADLEE (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate. 
BERNSTEIN What's a real denial? 
BRADLEE If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons. 
CUT TO: 
THE UNION GUYS IN THE POST 
looking at a new headline:

GANDALF Nothing, Frodo... 
Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.   He is overjoyed to find Frodo awake. 
SAM Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!! 
GANDALF Sam has hardly left your side. 
SAM We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf? 
GANDALF By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's 
bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. 
ELROND Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with awe. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY -- DAY 
WIDE ON: RIVENDELL... a small cluster of elegant Elven Buildings sitting in a Shangri-la like Valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ELROND (V.O.) You have found your way to the last homely house east of the sea. The elves of Imladris have dwelt within this valley for three thousand years through few of my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from his balcony. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVENDELL GARDENS -- DAY 
Frodo and Sam walk together. Suddenly, the voices of Merry and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw their arms around him. 
MERRY Frodo!   Frodo! 
Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's gaze... 
FRODO Bilbo! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE -- DAY 
Close on: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks in to a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him. 
BILBO Hello, Frodo, my lad! 
FRODO Bilbo! 
LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal: 
FRODO (CONT'D) (reading) "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale" by Bilbo Baggins. 
Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FRODO (CONT'D) This is wonderful. 
BILBO I meant to go back...wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again...but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. 
Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire. 
FRODO (quietly) I miss the Shire...I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else...off with you, on one of your adventures... (Looks at Bilbo) But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different...I'm not like you, Bilbo. 
BILBO My dear boy... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE -- EVENING 
Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes. 
SAM No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam. 
FRODO Packed already? 
Sam looks up, startled. 
SAM (slightly embarrassed) No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony. 
FRODO I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM I do...

ON SHANE 
He's stripped down sitting on a bench. Reporters are trying to interview him. Microphones are in his face and video cameras jockey for position. 
SHANE ... just glad to be back playing. That's all I've really got to say. 
REPORTER But where have you been? What have you been doing to make a living? 
SHANE Well... I've been involved lately in the... aquatic business... 
ON MICKEY LEE AND ROLAND LAMONT 
Mickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big complicated knee brace. (NOTE: There should be something slightly medieval about this brace.) 
MICKEY You only played one game?! 
ROLAND Actually, less than two minutes. I was a rookie third round pick in '93. We were playing Atlanta in the home opener. Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in, I took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers. Simultaneously. One a 
side. My knee turned into wet toilet paper. End of career. 
MICKEY Can you play on it now? 
Roland takes out a wrench and starts unscrewing a bolt on his brace. 
ROLAND I've been teaching high school football for five years. It's not a bad life. I'm good at it. There are some days when I actually love it. But for one more shot at this? Shit. I'd give it all up. This time, they're gonna have to take me out in a box. 
ON EARL WILKINSON (CRIMINAL) 
He's standing naked in front of his locker staring with anticipation at a garment bag. 
Slowly, he unzips the bag revealing a beautiful new suit. He touches the lapels reverently. 
ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN 
He's sitting in front of a locker, holding his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin. 
Someone walks by. 
CLIFFORD I got Wilson Boone's locker, man. Do you believe that shit? 
He drops his ball and quickly picks it up again. He looks around to make sure Coach didn't see him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BIG O PARKING LOT - MORNING 
The regular Redskins are out in force, holding signs as they lean on their Beamers and Porsches. 
Shane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda. 
When he gets out, he's immediately surrounded by six striking regulars, led by quarterback Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones. 
MARTEL Hey, you can't park there. 
SHANE Look, I don't want any trouble. 
MARTEL You don't want any trouble?! You're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble? (to Wilson) He doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone. 
Shane looks but it's obvious he's parked legally. 
SHANE Okay.   I'll move it. 
MARTEL No, we'll do that for you. Go ahead, Wilson. Move it for him. 
Wilson motions to another big guy. The two of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its roof. It lands with a crunch. 
JAMAL (O.S.) You all put that car back. 
Everybody turns to see Andre and Jamal walking towards them. 
WILSON Who the fuck are you? 
ANDRE We're the people who take care of the quarterback. We're the guards. 
All the regulars laugh at this. 
JAMAL Put the car back. Gently. 
WILSON Kiss my ass. 
SHANE (to Jamal) It's okay. 
JAMAL No, it's not. 
Jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue Porsche. 
JAMAL (to Wilson) That's your ride, ain't it? 
Before Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls his NINE MILLIMETER. BOOM! BOOM! No more Porsche windshield. 
All the regular Redskins dive for cover. 
WILSON My windshield! You crazy motherfucker! 
JAMAL Move his car back. 
WILSON My car! 
Jamal raises his GUN again.    POW!   No Porsche driver's side window. 
WILSON No!   Stop! 
He turns to his cowering teammates. 
WILSON Come on, help me, god damn it! 
The guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it right side up.

BRANDT - or until the war is over. 
GRANDFATHER It will never be over! 
BRANDT You have your answer then. 
The motorbikes start up and drive off. The Grandfather hugging tiny Emilie as she coughs. 
The Germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the child bereft in the bitter cold. 
EXT. GERMAN CAMP. LATER. 
Two grooms trail Brandt, leading Joey and Topthorn toward a makeshift corral. 
BRANDT Heiglemann - these are yours. 
FRIEDRICH Yes, sir. 
BRANDT They look strong - should last a month or two. FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at Topthorn. 
FRIEDRICH You are beautiful. 
But then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard and weak. He turns to Joey. 
FRIEDRICH (CONT'D) It's a pity they found you. 
He takes the leads of the pair of them. He sighs... 
FRIEDRICH (CONT'D) Such a pity... 
In a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film. 
And then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the explanation of Friedrich's comment. The road they can see below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition. 
For Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi prison by the Japanese during World War 2. They have never seen horses in this condition. You can see in their eyes the confusion. This is a whole different world, where horses can turn into creatures that look like this. 
And it is also a vision of their future. This may be the moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope. For Joey it is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will fight through - because he always fights through. 
EXT. STEEP INCLINE. DAY. 
Friedrich leads Joey and Topthorn in the wake of THE HUGE MORSER - an elaborate 15 ton monstrosity with a six inch bore. It takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen men pushing from behind. 
ARTILLERY OFFICER Pull together! 
A soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon - pulled by a particularly wretched group of horses. ARTILLERY SOLDIER Halt! Halt! Stop! 
Lower down the hill, Friedrich waves down the rest of the column. 
FRIEDRICH Stop! Stop! 
At the front of the Morser, one of the lead horses collapses - he will never get up again. 
Brandt steps up, pulls a revolver out of his pocket and shoots the horse dead. It has come to this. 
Joey, Topthorn, and all the other horses are spooked by the pistol shot. 
Brandt shouts to Friedrich from the road. BRANDT Heiglemann, bring up another one! 
ARTILLERY OFFICER Heiglemann, bring up another horse! 
BRANDT That one! 
Friedrich begins leading Joey up the hill, but -- 
BRANDT (CONT'D) No, no. The big black one! 
Friedrich hauls Topthorn, hesitantly, while Joey watches. 
As he reaches Brandt: 
FRIEDRICH He's a good horse, sir. But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all. Prince is already losing condition. His leg, sir. 
BRANDT You have given them names?

LULA Like you, sweetheart.  You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose.  Only difference is your color hair is like mine. 
PACE My daddy aint never killed nobody, has he, mama? 
LULA Course he aint never killed nobody. Whyd you say that, Pace? 
PACE Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin. 
LULA And? 
PACE Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man. 
LULA Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never committed no murder.  Musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper.  He made some mistakes, is all.  Your daddy aint always been so lucky...  Were almost at the depot, honey.  Sit back a minute. 
CUT TO: 
157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING 
Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the engine. 
PACE Why we sittin here, mama? 
LULA Thinkin a second, baby. 
Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten minutes past six. 
PACE Im scared, mama. 
LULA Why, honey? 
PACE Case daddy dont like me.  What if he dont like that I dont got his color hair. 
LULA Pace, your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all. 
CUT TO: 
158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING 
Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette. 
LULA Still partial to Camels, huh? 
Sailor smiles. 
SAILOR First pack of tailor-mades I had in a while. 
He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand. 
SAILOR You must be my son. 
LULA Shake hands with your daddy. 
Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go. 
SAILOR Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read a lot about you. 
Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose.  Sailor tries to smile. 
LULA You hungry?  Pace and I aint had dinner yet. 
SAILOR Lead the way. 
Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car. 
CUT TO: 
159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT 
Lula drives. 
SAILOR No rag top, huh? 
Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns off the engine and gets out of the car. 
PACE Whats wrong, mama? 
SAILOR (turning to Pace and patting his head) Dont worry, son.  Just stay here. 
Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the hood. 
LULA Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant help it.  Give me a minute and Ill quit. 
SAILOR Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint no good. 
LULA Really, Sail, Ill be okay. 
SAILOR Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on. Ill walk back to the depot. 
LULA Whatre you talkin about?  Thats your son in there. 
SAILOR He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget. Not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too. 
LULA How can you say that, Sailor?

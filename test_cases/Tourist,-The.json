{"train": "THE TOURIST \nWritten by \nJulian Fellows \nBased on \"Anthony Zimmer\" \nby \nJerome Salle \nJune 9 2008 \nEXT. PARIS - DAY \nCRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool, gray and beautiful. \nA taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business. \nThe door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out. \nINT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY \nWE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station. Men turn and stare. \nCARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the other. \nINT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY \nA YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart. \nAn OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar. \nWAITER She's waiting for someone. \nYOUNGER WAITER Probably waiting for me. \nWAITER The door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work. \nA MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a photograph. \nHis eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a document-sized envelope. \nMESSENGER C'est vous, Mademoiselle? \nCARA Oui. \nAs the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the Orient Express and a handwritten letter... \nShe spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads... \nALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (English accent) They are following you Cara. \nShe looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her... \nALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They think you'll lead them to me. But if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away... \nCara scans the rest of the letter. \nCAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom: \"Love, Alexander.\" \nWe barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it. \nThe YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed. \nYOUNGER WAITER Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie-- \nCara is already gathering her things and walking away. \nINT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Cara walks toward the platform... \nALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) Take the 4:25 Orient Express to Venice. En route select a man my approximate height and weight... \nHer eyes scan the platform. \nALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Have faith Cara. I'll be with you soon. \nCARA'S POV \nShe slides forward on her seat, to get even closer. \nCARA Don't be afraid. \nThe train car sways slightly and throws Frank off balance. He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives-- with a tearing sound. \nFrank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers. \nFRANK I'm... sorry. \nCara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment. \nCARA It doesn't matter. \nFRANK Maybe I should let you do this-- \nCARA Don't give up so quickly. \nReluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch. \nFirst her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward. No sign of anything underneath. \nFrank is practically sweating. \nFinally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat. \nCara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever. \nCARA (CONT'D) Thanks. \nAnd settles back into her seat, cat-like. He stares at her for several moments, at a loss for words. \nFRANK My name is Frank. \nCARA Cara. \nA white-jacketed STEWARD arrives. \nSTEWARD (to Frank) Will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur? \nFRANK Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not actually-- \nCARA The dining car would be lovely, thank you. \nThe steward nods and disappears.    Frank just stares. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET \nThe Orient Express plows through the Alps. PUSH IN ON a window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic, candlelit table eating dinner. \nINT. DINING CAR - EVENING \nLinen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket. \nFrank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then another and another... \nHe takes one or two pills from each and swallows them methodically. She watches him. \nCARA Are you ill? \nFRANK What?   No. \nShe looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Just nervous.    I don't like travelling. \nCARA (gently mocking) So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express? \nHe hesitates. \nFRANK I'm on my honeymoon. \nCARA Your honeymoon? \nCara is annoyed at this revelation. \nCARA (CONT'D) Should we ask the waiter to set another place? \nFRANK She's in Pennsylvania. \nACKERMAN Our target's name is Alexander Pearce. British citizen, born in London into an ordinary middle class family. The only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers. \nAckerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen behind him: a fuzzy photo of a British schoolboy with a shy grin. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Which he used to hack into a computer and fix the test results his final year at school. \nJEAN LUC (French Interpol liaison) looks up skeptically. \nJEAN LUC Your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own? \nACKERMAN He didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class. It made him very popular. \nA ripple of laughter through the group. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) (severely) What started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious. After a year in the training program at Goldman Sachs, he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living. That, in turn, involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling: money laundering. \nQUINN is the Swiss Interpol liaison. He speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages. \nQUINN You've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, Mr. Ackerman. \nACKERMAN There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form. His greatest innovation: The False Lawsuit. \nHe clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides illustrating Pearce's financial dealings. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Pearce sets up two companies: one is a Casino in Arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the Cayman Islands. (MORE) \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) The Cayman Islands company files a lawsuit against the casino, claiming copyright infringement or some other complaint. They \"succeed\" in winning the case and the casino pays the shell company an enormous settlement. \nQUINN (understanding) The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands... \nACKERMAN Yes, but now the money is legal. \nJONES Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has been cheated out of the revenue. (beat) We calculate that Mr. Pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743.7 million dollars. \nJean Luc leans toward his colleague. \nJEAN LUC (whispers in French) That explains what the American harridan is doing here. \nMs. Jones gives him a glacial stare. \nJONES Exactement, monsieur. \nJean Luc reddens. Oops.   Apparently not every American fits the stereotype. \nACKERMAN Mr. Pearce has some other debts as well. Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov... \nClick: A PHOTO of a balding RUSSIAN OLIGARCH emerging from a limo. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) ...Pearce laundered over a billion dollars for Demidov. At some point Pearce decided he'd rather steal from Demidov than help him steal. (MORE) \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) (beat) Given Demidov's ties to organized crime, I'd say that was a mistake. \nJONES (clears her throat) The U.S. Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament; our target is Alexander Pearce. \nAckerman smiles coolly at her. \nACKERMAN Of course. \nAn INTERPOL OFFICER from Germany raises his hand. \nGERMAN INTERPOL Has Mr. Pearce ever been in custody? \nAckerman looks down for a moment, as if it pains him to answer. \nACKERMAN Almost. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALEXANDER'S SEA SIDE VILLA, VENICE - NIGHT \nSUPER:   ONE YEAR AGO \nFog covers the skyline, exposing only the slate rooftops of buildings that haven't changed in centuries. We hear the sound of water gently lapping the shore. \nFrom out of the mist emerges... \nA GUARDACOSTE -- a patrol boat, lights dimmed. It gently touches the beach. A CARABINIERI officer lowers a ramp. \nAn INTERPOL TACTICS TEAM in Kevlar and headgear pours out of the patrol boat. \nAckerman steps off, pulling on a vest.     He nods to Goyal. \nShe wears Alexander's WATCH.... \nQUINN (V.O.) What does this Alexander Pearce look like? \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERPOL CENTRAL BRIEFING ROOM - RESUME \nAckerman closes the file in front of him on the podium. \nACKERMAN Nobody knows. He disappeared after his escape. He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then. Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities. \nQUINN How do you know about it? \nACKERMAN Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time. He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal. None of them would cooperate. We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery. \nJEAN LUC So nobody knows what he looks like? \nACKERMAN Correct. \nJEAN LUC Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance...  What makes you think you can catch him now? \nAckerman regards him with aplomb. \nACKERMAN His girlfriend was recently released from custody. He'll come for her. We'll be waiting. \nQUINN What makes you so certain? \nAckerman clicks on a slide. \nCara's face fills the screen behind him.   A murmur runs through the room. Every man stares. \nACKERMAN He'll come for her. \nAckerman himself glances up at her face with a look of longing. \nHOLD ON CARA'S IMAGE for a moment before we... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING \nCARA stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the station. The gleaming train stretches out behind her. \nINT. TRAIN CAR - SAME \nFrank's eyes drift open. He glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped. He sits bolt upright. \nA CONDUCTOR'S VOICE over the loudspeaker is saying something in Italian. \nFrank stumbles over himself to collect his things:      book, sweater, pills, etc. \nINT. TRAIN AISLE - MOMENTS LATER \nFrank struggles down the aisle, bumping into fellow passengers and apologizing as he goes. All the while looking around for a sign of Cara... \nEXT. VENICE TRAIN STATION - MORNING \nFrank steps off the train and glances about at the hive of activity. \nFrank brushes past the GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN from the Paris station. Finally he spots her... \nFRANK'S POV - Cara with her back turned. \nFrank hurries over. \nFRANK I was afraid I'd missed you. I wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought maybe-- \nCARA (without turning) I've got a better idea. \nShe holds out her valise for him. \nHe takes it hesitantly. She peers at him over the rims of her sunglasses with a very slight smile... \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE, GRAND CANAL - DAY \nA beauty shot of the Grand Canal: magnificent palaces and churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory. \nPUSH IN ON A launch labelled Danieli, travelling fast over the water. Cara shakes her head to let the wind ruffle her hair. \nShe looks up at him. \nCARA You're smarter than you look, Frank. \nShe runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. Then, impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand. \nCARA (CONT'D) And you're right. Here, take it. \nShe puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests. \nFRANK What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune-- \nCARA I insist. You're doing me a favor. (firm) Take it or I'll toss it in the ocean. \nHe hesitates.   She means it.    He closes the clasp. \nFRANK I'll wear it until you regain your senses. \nHe feels the heft of it on his wrist. Admires it for a moment. It really is a beautiful watch. She settles back in her chair, pleased with herself. \nHe looks up and sees her smiling at him. \nFRANK (CONT'D) What? \nCARA It suits you. \nLONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset. A romantic dinner for two. They could easily be lovers or honeymooners... \nIn the foreground REVEAL somebody watching them.   The good-looking Englishman is there, hovering... \nINT. DOGE'S SUITE - NIGHT \nThe key sounds in the lock and the door swings open. Frank and Cara tumble in together, laughing, a little tipsy. \nHe glances at the sofa and that sobers him up, reminding him where he's going to sleep. However... \nHe watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off her shoes. She throws open the French doors to the balcony. \nFrank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside. \nEXT. BALCONY - NIGHT \nCara looks out across the lagoon. \nFrank appears beside her. \nFRANK I could get used to this. \nA movement in the street down below catches her eye. She studies the Ponte del Vin intently, seeing something. \nCara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against his. He's taken by surprise but willingly responds to her advance, wrapping his arms around her back. \nThey exchange a long, passionate kiss. \nVIDEO POV OF THE SAME \nREVEAL the lens of a PALM-SIZED VIDEO CAMERA peering out from behind a vendor's cart in the street below. \nFrank, his face slightly obscured, kisses Cara. \nWE HEAR the WHIRRING of the video camera. \nI/E. DOGE'S SUITE/BALCONY - RESUME \nStill kissing, Cara leads Frank back into the hotel room... \nEXT. VIDEO POV FROM THE STREET - CONTINUOUS \nThe silhouettes of Cara and Frank disappear into the hotel room as... \nINT. DOGE'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nCara closes the curtains.   She pulls away from him. \nHer composure changes; the passion is gone.   The expression on her face is matter-of-fact. \nCARA You should leave Venice tomorrow. (softer) It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed engagement. \nShe turns and walks toward her bedroom... \nFrank stares after her in stunned disappointment. \nINT. CARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nFrank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers. The bed is unmade. \nCara has left a shirt over a chair... he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent. \nHe notices a newspaper... a copy of The International Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table. He lifts it to see what Cara had been reading. \nThere is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen. The message is just a list of words: \n\"TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL AROUND.\" \nThe dots single out letters in a code... Frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message: \n\"Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro\" \nFrank studies this for a moment. \nTHE BUZZER SOUNDS \nLaying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Breakfast. \nFrank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses.   Breakfast again? \nHe quietly slides the chain on.    Peers through the spyhole. \nSPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS. \nFrank is frozen. \nScarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK PICK SET and crouches out of frame. \nFrank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it... \nCh-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause. \nA moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain... \nFrank stares at the knife; he has to act fast... \nFrank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place. \nThere's angry confusion on the other side of the door. \nFrank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock. \nFrank scrambles out of the way... \nThe sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open... \nFrank looks around desperately for an escape. \nThe bathroom?   The sitting room?   Adjoining doors?   None. \nThere's nowhere to go. \nFrank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet. \nHe scrambles outside as... \nPOP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal, blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open. \nEXT. BALCONY - DAY \nFrank looks down and stares at the \nDIZZYING SIX STORY DROP \nto the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below. \nGuests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee. \nThree balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the modern wing of the hotel. \nIN THE SUITE \nThe two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching. Nyet, Nyet. \nThe one place they haven't checked... \nINT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY \nDucking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for the back entrance and finds it. \nHe stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his forehead as well as his hand. He has \nSECONDS \nto decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines. \nThe back of the shop upends the Grand Canal. \nEXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Russians burst out the back. \nThere is no sign of Frank. \nScarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing. \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE OF SCENE \nFrank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the leather shop, barely able to control his frantic breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him... \nHe looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian WOMAN peering out over her window box. \nFrank raises a desperate finger to his lips.    A prayer that she won't give him away. \nShe looks at him disapprovingly.     Then disappears back inside. \nCLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding. \nSeconds tick past...   is he safe? \nRrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun, tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's head. \nHe cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below... \nA MOMENTARY BLACKOUT \nFrank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him. One of them holds a nightstick. \nThey stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLIZIA \"QUESTURA\" (POLICE STATION) - DAY \nFrank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. Most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head. \nFrom down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE OFFICER, DOMENICO (30's, animated), walks into the room where Frank is waiting. \nDomenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters. \nDOMENICO (in Italian) You can't let them stay over, man. You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car. Stop cuddling, Tomaso! \nFrank stands. \nFRANK Excuse me... \nDOMENICO (suddenly noticing him) Hey, what are you doing in here? \nFRANK The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours... \nDominico glances over his shoulder. \nDOMENICO I think they forgot about you. \nFrank sits back down heavily.    Domenico sits on the edge of a desk. \nDOMENICO (CONT'D) What happened to you, anyway? \nFRANK Somebody tried to kill me. \nDomenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it. \nDOMENICO Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a day. Eh? We got chasing, we got shooting. \nDomenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in his boxers. The story seems unlikely. \nAn immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's page fills the screen. The caption reads: \n#6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST. \nIn place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a man's head. \nFrank is about to scan for more information when he hears Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room where he was left... \nDOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands it to Frank. \nDOMENICO (CONT'D) Here.     Put these on. Time to go. \nFrank looks at the clothes. \nFRANK Um... thanks.   Where are we going? \nDOMENICO I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you. \nFRANK I'd really rather just go-- \nDOMENICO Don't worry. I put you in Padua, away from Venice. You'll be safe. (scribbles his number) Any worry, you call me. I give you my home number. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL SCANNING ROOM, PADUA - EVENING \nFrank lies flat on his back. \nA NURSE leans over him with a kindly expression. \nNURSE Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head. \nShe slides him slowly into the mouth of an MRI scanning machine head first. It hums to life. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, DANIELI - EVENING \nDomenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the Doge's suite. \nCLERK (in Italian) Unfortunately we've already re-let the room. (nervous) We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident. \nDOMENICO Don't worry.   I'll be discreet. \nCLERK Grazie. \nThe Clerk knocks.   The door is opened by Ivan Demidov. \nCLERK (CONT'D) I beg your pardon, Signore, but this is a police officer. He needs to briefly examine the room. \nDEMIDOV Of course. \nDemidov steps back, holding the door open. \nINT. DOGE'S SUITE, DANIELI - EVENING \nDemidov watches Domenico, who sniffs around. \nDEMIDOV (casually) What happened, officer? \nDOMENICO That's what I'm trying to find out, Signore. \nDomenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing. \nHe puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself. Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him. \nDEMIDOV You are a good detective. \nDOMENICO I do my best. \nDomenico stands and takes his leave. \nDOMENICO (CONT'D) Sorry for the inconvenience. Enjoy your stay. \nAs he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the other room. Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to follow... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM, PADUA - NIGHT \nFrank lies on the bed. There are clean bandages on his injuries. \nThe television drones on the wall: an Italian reality show. A WOMAN holds her hands over her eyes. The HOST taunts her: \nTHE HOST (V.O.) (in Italian) Now remember, I said you were in for a surprise... a big surprise. \nThe footsteps move away slightly... there is the sound of a door opening. The door across the hall. \nSeconds pass. The door is closed again.      The footsteps move down the hall, slowly fading away. \nFrank punches in the policeman's number and grips the receiver. It rings. \nINT. DOMENICO'S TERRACE FLAT - NIGHT \nA saucepot simmers on the stove. The phone RINGS. Behind it is a WINDOW - pierced by one circular bullet hole. \nThe music still plays. \nAs our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenico's bare feet, prone behind the kitchen island. \nThe phone RINGS and RINGS... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nFrank is struggling into his clothes. Everything seems to stick and take forever. \nHe opens the door a crack and looks down the ward. Nothing. He moves along the passage, slipping into doorways and out of the light. \nHe finds the elevator and jabs at the button. \nThe light shows it is approaching the floor. It stops. The doors open. Frank is about to enter it, when suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT... \nAn ORDERLY exits and brushes past. \nFrank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in. \nINT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR, PADUA - NIGHT \nFrank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to close. \nSlowly the elevator descends... and stops. \nThe doors open. A big MAN stands with his back to us, blocking the exit. Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to hide. The man turns. \nHe's a MALE NURSE, waiting to get into the lift. He stands aside to allow Frank to leave. Frank takes a step out... \n...and sees SCARFACE talking to the receptionist. Hurriedly, Frank reverses back into the elevator. \nFRANK (to the Nurse) Wrong floor. \nThen, just before the doors close, Scarface turns... his eyes meet Frank's. He starts towards the elevator... but the doors shut first. \nThe lift stops again. The doors open on the first tier of the subterranean car park. \nFrank leaps off. \nINT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK, PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nLimping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked Uscita in the far corner. \nAn ENGINE ROAR splits the silence. The lights blind Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him. \nHe falls to his knees. \nThe car skids to a stop. \nThe door flies open. He squints. Sitting behind the wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is CARA. He stares. \nCARA What are you waiting for?    Get in. \nINT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT \nHe climbs into the car.    She turns to him as she pulls out. \nCARA Did you miss me? \nFRANK A little. \nHe glances anxiously over her shoulder. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Um... you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me-- \nCARA (calm) I know. \nCara drives toward the ramp.     He looks at her. \nFRANK Do you know why? \nINT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the car. \nFrank sits in a daze.   He turns to her. \nFRANK Do I look that much like Alexander Pearce? \nCara turns sharply. \nCARA How do you know--? \nFrank holds up his wrist. \nFRANK The watch. \nShe hesitates.   A pause. \nCARA I don't know. You're about his size. That's all. \nFRANK (incredulous) You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like? \nCARA Alexander crossed a very dangerous man. He changed his appearance in order to vanish. \nFRANK Great. \nCARA Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe. \nFRANK We should go to the police. \nCARA Because they did such a good job protecting you before? \nFrank doesn't respond. \nCARA (CONT'D) Trust me. \nFrank looks at her. Then relents, leaning his head back against the support and closing his eyes. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF VENICE - MORNING \nThe car is parked along a muddy canal. Beside it runs a small disconnected set of palazzos. Cara shakes Frank. He won't wake up. \nCARA Frank... Frank. \nHe's snoring.   She pinches his nose closed... \nHe startles awake.   She smiles mischievously. \nON A SIDE STREET \nHe follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men sitting on stone steps. \nFRANK And I thought I wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing. \nFrank steps over a greenish puddle. \nCARA Here we are. \nShe pauses before a run-down palazzo. \nINT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - NIGHT \nThe narrow hall is dark and shabby. \nCara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing.     She opens it with a key. \nINT. PEARCE'S \"SAFE HOUSE\" - NIGHT \nIt is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver in the darkness. The sound of a hand bumping against a wall. \nFinally somebody finds the light switch and-- \nCARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her. \nFrank happens to be right in her line of sight.   He flinches. \nFRANK Whoa! \nCARA Sorry. \nCARA He's the most interesting man I've ever known. When I first met him, I wasn't expecting that. He took me by surprise. \nShe shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if reliving a memory of sensual pleasure. \nCARA (CONT'D) If I'd been prepared, I might not have loved him. But I wasn't. So I did. \nShe frowns into her empty wine glass.    Frank slides a little closer. \nFRANK (soft) I don't regret it, you know. \nCARA Regret what? \nFRANK Kissing you. \nHe looks into her eyes. They are sitting very close on the sofa. The lights are low. The mood is romantic... \nFrank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a kiss-- \nCara stands abruptly. \nCARA What are you doing? \nHe looks   up at her, questioningly. \nFRANK I thought... \nCARA You thought what? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped? That all my life I've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet? \nFrank doesn't respond. \nCARA (CONT'D) I picked you because of your height. Do you understand? \nHe does. His humiliation complete, he rises with as much dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the kitchen. \nCara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt. She is about to say something when... \nHer CELL PHONE RINGS.     A special ring. \nShe answers right away. \nEXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING \nThe ENGLISHMAN strolls the Piazza San Marco.    FOLLOW HIM from behind as he speaks into his phone. \nTHE ENGLISHMAN Have you been reading the newspaper? \nIN THE SAFE HOUSE \nCara narrows her focus. She walks away from Frank, stealing away into the bedroom. Her heart is beating. \nCARA Yes... there was nothing there today. Is... is it you? Alexa-- \nTHE ENGLISHMAN No names.    Not on the phone. \nINT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - EVENING \nThe WAVE PATTERNS of the man's voice shimmer on a computer monitor. Goyal and Ackerman stand watching, hanging on every word. \nTHE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.) (from the speakers) It's been a busier weekend than I expected. \nACKERMAN Place him.   Place him! \nA HORN-RIMMED AIDE zeroes in on a MAP screen. \nThe screen gives him a map of VENICE.      Then zooms into a map of the SAN MARCO district... \nINT. BEDROOM, \"SAFE HOUSE\" - CONTINUOUS \nCara holds one finger in her ear, listening intently. \nTHE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.) There's a recipe in a Tuscan cookbook there I need. Would you look it up for me? \nCARA Do we really need another \"recipe?\" \nTHE ENGLISHMAN I want to make sure our guests are surprised. \nEXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING \nThe Englishman passes the Lagoon to his left, and enters an enormous courtyard, the Arco Foscari. He looks down at his watch... \nTHE ENGLISHMAN You're a brave and loyal girl. I'm in awe of you. \nFrank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Well I'm not playing the role anymore. I'm going to confront him. He's supposed to meet you here, isn't he? I'm going to tell him exactly what I think of him. \nCARA Wonderful. Another macho idiot. (to the waiter) Conto, per favore! \nFrank leans in. \nFRANK What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail? \nCARA I'm leaving Frank. \nFRANK He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too. \nCARA It's really a shame you've scared him off-- \nShe tosses some Euros on the table. \nCARA (CONT'D) The two of you make a nice couple. \nThe THIN WAITER arrives with a PLATTER.   He sets it down in front of Cara. \nThe UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a grim expression... \nThe THIN WAITER removes the platter.   Cara looks down. \nSpelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the following: \n\"MY VILLA.    TONIGHT. 8PM.\" \nCara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now see is THE ENGLISHMAN... \n...BLOWS on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper granules to the wind. \nFRANK What the hell? \nAs Frank looks up. \nThe Englishman has already turned away, but the Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table. \nThe Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen... \nThen FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter, mistaking him for Pearce. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Is this him? \nCARA Frank! \nINT. TRANSPORTO - DAY \nAckerman slaps the cabin table. \nACKERMAN Abort!   Abort, goddammit! \nTHE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT \nThe Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank. \nFRANK You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you? \nFrank SHOVES him back. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Where I come from, we don't treat women like that! \nFrank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with unaccustomed strength. \nCara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant. She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward the Palazzo Vendramin. \nIn the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and realizes she's gone. \nThe Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee... Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't Pearce. \nINT. TRANSPORTO - DAY \nGetting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock. \nON THE MONITOR: Frank looks around and sees Cara:     fifty feet away. Walking with purpose. \nACKERMAN That goddamn fool. \nAckerman rubs his face and squats down, frustrated beyond measure. \nINT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY \nAckerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and police. Various members of the task force follow their progress... Jean Luc, Jones, etc. \nThey arrive at a central INTEL area where Goyal sits in front of several computer monitors. \nHe looks up as Ackerman and Frank arrive. \nACKERMAN (to Goyal) Pull up the CID Academy graduating class for 2002. \nGoyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told. A few moments later a photo of POLICE RECRUITS in uniform comes up on screen. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Take a good look. \nFrank peers at the screen. He spots the instructor-- Ackerman seven years younger. \nFRANK You? \nACKERMAN Take a look at the second row. \nINSERT CLOSE UP on the screen. \nFrank examines the second row. One of the young women is... CARA MASON. Her hair is pulled back. She looks more the determined police cadet than the sexy siren...  but it's definitely her. \nFRANK Cara... \nHe is dumbfounded. \nACKERMAN We've been watching you this entire time. \nFRANK (dawning) You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene? \nACKERMAN I'm trying to apprehend a major criminal. I'm not a babysitter. \nFrank grows angry. \nFRANK I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy. I'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen! Let's see what my government has to say about that! \nJones clears her throat from a chair across the room. \nJONES We're aware of the situation, Mr. Taylor. But we take a long view of these things... fortunately you are unhurt... \nFrank is incredulous. \nFRANK Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times. \nACKERMAN (quietly) No.   I don't think you'll do that. \nFRANK Why not? \nACKERMAN Because I don't think you want to see Cara's entire career destroyed. \nFrank falls silent. Ackerman puts an arm around his shoulder and leads him away from the others. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Espresso? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY \nFrank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway. Ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso. Hands one to Frank. \nACKERMAN Women like Cara don't come along very often. \nFRANK In my case, they don't come along at all. \nACKERMAN She's the worst combination: stunning looks and a brilliant mind. \nFRANK If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce? \nACKERMAN It started out as a straightforward placement... \nINT. DOGE'S PALACE - DAY [FLASHBACK] \nCara (younger) poses as an art student, sketching a SCULPTURE in the Anticollegio. \nACKERMAN (V.O.) ...we ran her deep cover to build a case against Pearce. It took. He hired her as an assistant. \nShe turns her face and smiles at an UNSEEN MAN. \nEXT. YACHT - DAY [FLASHBACK] \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY \nAckerman strides into the room, calling for attention. \nACKERMAN Okay everybody, listen up. \nJones, Quinn, Jean Luc and the rest of the team assemble. Goyal has Frank with him, dragging him around like a lost puppy dog... \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) We have a location and time for the next meet.    Pearce's villa. Eight o'clock. We have to move fast-- \nJONES Pearce's own villa? Why would he risk going back there? He must know we'd be watching. \nJEAN LUC Perhaps he's nostalgic. \nACKERMAN I doubt that. Maybe there's something of value still there. He left in a hurry after all. \nJONES Call in a search team. \nACKERMAN We searched the place after the raid last year. If there's anything hidden there, only Pearce knows where it is. \nHe picks up his coat. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) We need to get agents in place all around the villa. \nFrank speaks up unexpectedly. \nFRANK If you're all around his house, will he show up? \nA dozen heads turn to look at him. \nACKERMAN If I needed your advice Mr. Taylor, I'd ask. \nFrank shrinks down in his chair. \nA beat.   Ackerman turns back to the rest of the room. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Establish a wide perimeter. We'll keep our distance and wire the entire villa for video surveillance. \nThe meeting breaks up.   Everybody jumps into action. \nON QUINN as he slips out a side door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY \nA standard hotel room-- no lavish suite this time. \nCara stands in front of the mirror. Her shirt is unbuttoned as she works to attach a TINY MICROPHONE to her bra. \nThe tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over... \nA KNOCK on her hotel room door. \nCARA Come in. \nFrank enters the room.    Sees her half-dressed-- \nFRANK I'm sorry. \nCARA It's okay.   Come over here.    I need your help. \nIn an echo of their first meeting on the train (but without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands him a piece of tape. \nTheir eyes meet.   A flicker of a smile passes between them. \nFrank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt. \nFRANK Ackerman told me everything. \nShe takes a deep breath. \nCARA I'm sorry Frank. \nFRANK There's no apology necessary. \nHe steps back from her.    She smooths her blouse.   Turns to him. \nCARA (re: the wire) How do I look? \nEXT. BACK OF THE VILLA - NIGHT \nThe black boat slips underneath some moorings. \nA gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten feet overhead. It catches. The boat is tied off. \nSilently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi- darkness. \nINT. SURVEILLANCE OUTPOST IN CHURCH \nON THE MONITOR WE SEE \nPEARCE'S ENTRY HALL. Cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside. \nINT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA/VIDEO MONITORS - CONTINUOUS \nTRACK from screen to screen as WE FOLLOW Cara moving through the deserted rooms. \nEverything is cold and lifeless.   Like a palace that has been turned into a museum. \nINT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS \nWhile everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's progress, Frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side... \nIt shows the lower floor of the house. \nFRANK (points) Who's that? \nThey all turn to look. A male figure, his face masked, approaches the lens of the surveillance camera... \nBLINK!   The FEED shuts off. \nAckerman barks at a technician. \nACKERMAN What happened? Get it back on line! \nThe surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc. \nJONES Was that Pearce? \nGOYAL How did he know there would be a camera? \nBLINK!   Another monitor goes dark.   Then another. \nJONES He's taking out the entire surveillance system-- \nACKERMAN Stop him. \nTECHNICIAN I can't! He's cutting the feed at the source. \nFrank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the stairs... \nBlink! She disappears from view as well.      Everybody starts talking. \nJEAN LUC How can one man move through the house that fast? \nGOYAL (overlapping) What should we do? \nACKERMAN Shut up!    Everyone. \nThey quiet down.   Ackerman turns to the tech. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Do we still have audio? \nThe tech nods. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Turn it up. \nEverybody in the Church stands stock still.    Staring at the dark monitors. Listening. \nCara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow... \nThey move tentatively across the floor. \nWE HEAR A THUMP.   A door or a heavy footstep? \nCara's breathing gets louder.    There's somebody else in the building. \nCARA (V.O.) Alexander? \nNo response.   Click, clack, click... She takes a few steps. \nEveryone in the room flinches. \nDEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D) You know... I have a feeling he is around here somewhere. And if he cares about you... if he wants to see your lovely face again... he should show up before it's too late. \nANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST.      This time Cara cries out in pain. \nGoyal turns to Ackerman. \nGOYAL Sir? \nACKERMAN Demidov's right. He's here somewhere... \nAnother SLAP.    Another scream. \nJean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn... then turns to Ackerman. Every one of them is about to burst. \nJEAN LUC We have to do something-- \nACKERMAN We have to wait. \nJEAN LUC Yes but-- \nACKERMAN (harsh) She's my agent. She's my responsibility. \nA muffled THUD. Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the floor. That wasn't a slap. \nEvery cop in the room is clenching his weapon. Desperate for the order to move. To jump in and stop this. \nThey are all looking to Ackerman to give the order. \nAs the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver. She speaks quietly to Ackerman. \nJONES What if he doesn't come? \nAckerman doesn't respond. \nThe lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before. \nSuddenly Goyal notices... \nGOYAL Where's Taylor? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nFrank runs for all he's worth.    Panting for breath. \nINT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT \nFrank bursts through the front door.      Races to the steps without hesitating... \nINT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nCara lies on her side at Demidov's feet.     Blood trickles from the side of her mouth. \nHer eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half-askew. Then they suddenly come into focus as she sees... \nA figure walks into the room.    FRANK. \nHe stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm. \nDemidov turns. \nDEMIDOV (leans down to Cara) Good news. He loves you. \nDemidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward. \nCara lifts her head with an effort. \nCARA That's not Alexander Pearce. \nDemidov ignores her and walks up to Frank. \nDEMIDOV You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I was finished with this sort of thing. But in your case, I've been forced to make an exception. \nHe holds out his hand and one of his THUGS gives him a PISTOL and a SILENCER. \nCARA He is NOT Alexander Pearce! \nDemidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel. \nSurprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a finger to her lips. \nShe hesitates... looks at him questioningly. But she doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra... \n...and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE. With a sharp tug, he rips it free. He tosses it across the room. \nThen he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear: \nFRANK (a British accent) You're wrong. I'm here. \nShe straightens up.   Her heart skips a beat. \nFRANK (CONT'D) It's me.   I'm here. \nShe covers her mouth.   Her eyes mist over with tears. \nShe runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement. Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face. \nHer mind reels... \nThen their lips meet. They kiss. And kiss.      Like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert. \nFinally she pulls away and looks at him. \nCARA Why? \nFRANK You said I'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if I did tell the truth... This was the only way to convince you. (pause) The truth is that I love you. All that matters is that you believe me. \nShe stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at her without a trace of deception. She believes. \nThey hear voices on the stairs below. \nFrank holds up a finger to her-- wait. \nFrank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor. \nFrank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie. \nFrank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT \nTRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs. \nHe leads the team into the PENTHOUSE. \nHe looks around at the mess as the agents fan out. \nCara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit. \nACKERMAN Cara... I want the paramedics to make sure you're all right-- \nShe blows right past him.     Ackerman calls out after her. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Cara... \nShe pauses.   Turns to face him. \nAckerman looks down for a moment, ashamed. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about this later. \nCARA No we won't. There's nothing to talk about. I don't work for you anymore. \nShe walks past him.    For a moment Ackerman and Frank look at one another. \nACKERMAN Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go. \nHe looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) It seems I underestimated you. \nFRANK (American accent) It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman. \nWith that, Frank steps out of the room.    Ackerman's attention is distracted by-- \nGOYAL Sir... over here. Take a look at this! \nGoyal has found the safe.   Ackerman comes over and looks. \n", "test1_input": "FRANK No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact. \nBefore he can say more, the buzzer sounds. \nCARA The luggage. \nFRANK I'll get it. \nHe goes back inside to answer the door. \nCara remains alone on the balcony, immobile, as if holding her breath. She's waiting... listening. \nINT. DOGE'S SUITE - DAY \nFrank walks across to the door. There is a small spyhole and he looks through it. The porter stands there with a trolley. Frank opens the door. \nThe porter wheels the trolley in and starts to carry the bags into the bedroom. \nEXT. BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER \nCara relaxes again as she hears Frank approach.   He steps outside on the balcony. \nFRANK I've put my things in the other bathroom. \nShe turns to face him. \nCARA Have you ever been to Venice before? \nHe shakes his head. \nCARA (CONT'D) Then we need to go out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY \nCAMERA TRACKS WITH GOYAL as he weaves through a sprawling mess of personnel and equipment, cell phones, computers and cables from various national agencies. The United Nations-aspect of the Task Force gives it impressive scope but also results in a Tower-of-Babel effect. \nThe calm eye of the storm is Ackerman. \nGOYAL She's checked into the Danieli... she's not alone. \nACKERMAN Good. (to the room) Maintain surveillance but keep your distance. (MORE) \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Don't try to get clever: remember that Pearce is smarter than most of you put together. \nANGLE ON QUINN who quietly slips out of the room. \nEXT. PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, VENICE - DAY \nA Gulfstream G550 executive jet banks over the Venetian coast and comes in for a landing... \nWheels down. Stairway unfolds. The man who steps off the plane is dressed in a hand-tailored Italian suit and shoes that cost more than some cars. He's flanked by two bodyguards. \nIVAN DEMIDOV.   In the flesh. \nEXT. VENICE - DAY \nCAMERA floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a ultra-high end business hotel. \nINT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nDemidov sips a glass of red wine. The view from his room rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no attention. He's busy scanning his emails on his Blackberry. \nKnock, knock. A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background goes to answer the door. A moment later... \nHe ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent. \nDEMIDOV Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I offer you a glass of Brunello? It's a '97... \nQUINN No thank you, Mr. Demidov. \nDemidov swirls his glass. \nDEMIDOV You know I'd never admit this at home, but Vodka is for peasants. There's much we could learn from the Italians. \nHe smiles pleasantly at Quinn, then, on a dime, he turns back to business. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) Tell me I'm not going to be disappointed. \nQuinn takes out an envelope and passes it over. \n", "test1_true": "He flips it open and examines the contents.     WE GLIMPSE a photo of CARA and some text. \nDEMIDOV (to himself) He always had good taste... \nDemidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with cash. \nQuinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the directness of the pay off. \nQUINN Mr. Demidov... if I may ask you a question... Why do you care so much about Alexander Pearce? I mean, you've come here yourself... as if it were personal. \nDemidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully. \nDEMIDOV It may be difficult for you to understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss are mercenary by nature. But for some of us, there are things more important than money. I put my trust in Alexander Pearce. He betrayed that trust. \nQuinn smiles tightly.   He's ready to get out of there. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) And it's bad business to let somebody make a fool of you. If Pearce gets away with it, what does that say about me? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE LIDO, VENICE - DAY \nA clear, bright winter day at the beach. Devoid of tourists, the famous stretch is a completely different Venice from the one we're used to seeing. \nSandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea. \nCara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand.   The wind wraps her light sun dress around her body, intermittently hugging her perfect curves. \nCARA So... when you're not on a Grand European Tour, what do you do in Rosemont, Pennsylvania? \nFRANK I'm a teacher. High school math. And you? What do you do? \nShe glances at him slyly over her movie star shades. \nCARA This is what I do, Frank. \nFRANK You're good at it. \nA sound of voices and laughter drift toward them. Up ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal clothes. A woman wears a white bridal dress. \nCARA Oh look... a wedding.   How lovely. \nFRANK I'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life... \nCARA Oh yes.   I forgot. \nShe takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with sidewalk tables. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BISTRO - AFTERNOON \nCara and Frank are seated.    A bottle of Orvieto rests on the table. \nCARA Do you think it's really over? \nFRANK Hmm? \nCARA Maybe she'll change her mind. Women do. She might give you a second chance. \nFRANK I suppose that's a possibility. (hesitates) That's what I tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance. Endless possibilities and permutations. You just have to calculate the odds. \nCARA You haven't answered the question. \nFRANK Well... (quietly) I'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance... \nCara looks at him curiously. \nCARA For a moment there you just reminded me of somebody. \nShe shakes her head and takes a sip of wine. \nCARA (CONT'D) He had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he'd completely avoided the truth. His entire life was wrapped up in deception. (lost in thought) He told so many lies, I wouldn't believe him even if he finally did tell the truth. \nFRANK He doesn't sound like much of a friend. \nCARA He wasn't. \nFrank glances at her wrist. \nFRANK So why are you wearing his watch? \n", "test1_id": 2853, "test2_input": "ON FRANK \nHis eyes are open. \nEXT. VENICE - MORNING \nEstablishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the winter time. \nBoats are pushed out into the canals... \nTrash is hosed from the cobblestone streets... \nTables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting for the tourists to come... \nINT. SITTING ROOM, \"SAFE HOUSE\" - MORNING \nWith an unfamiliar gentleness, Cara approaches Frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder. \nCARA Frank... I have to go. \nHe opens his eyes and looks at her. \nCARA (CONT'D) Don't go out. All you need is here. In four or five days everything will be resolved... \nFRANK Resolved? \nCARA It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back on. \nFRANK When will I see you again? \nCARA Never. \nShe looks at him evenly; one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds. \nCARA (CONT'D) Good-bye, Frank. \nShe leaves. \nINT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - DAY \nShe has started down the stairs when Frank appears on the landing. He leans over the balustrade. \nFRANK Is he worth it? \nCARA Get back inside. \nShe has stopped mid-flight. \nFRANK You're going to risk everything for him. Would he do the same for you? \nShe is quite straightforward in her response. \nCARA It doesn't matter. I love him. \nFRANK He doesn't deserve it. \nShe shakes her head. \nCARA None of this is your business anymore. Now get back inside Frank! \nJust as she raises her voice a door opens below them in the hall, and an old man comes out. He looks up at Cara. \nOLD MAN Signorina. \nThis is exactly what she did not want. But she controls her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the front door. \nCARA (to the neighbor) Mi dispiace, Signor. \nThe Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door. \nHe admires Cara's shapely form as she crosses the cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley. \nHe glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively. Frank turns and goes back inside. \nINT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY \nAckerman sits in an office chair, gently revolving. Jones, Goyal and Jean Luc are there as well. \nACKERMAN Why do women find these con men so appealing? \nJones is the only woman nearby... \n", "test2_true": "Jean Luc can't tell if she's serious. \nACKERMAN How did Pearce seduce that beautiful woman? Was it his charm? His looks? \nGOYAL Looks change. \nAckerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso. \nACKERMAN Maybe it's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires, so then can she. \nHe looks around to see if the others like this theory. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) She can become a child again. Who wouldn't want that? \nThere is a bitterness in Ackerman's tone that reveals he is personally hurt by this. \nGoyal's Blackberry makes a beep. \nGOYAL She's on the move. Time to go. \nAckerman pushes himself wearily to his feet. \nACKERMAN By all means.    Let's follow the children. \nINT. KITCHEN, \"SAFE HOUSE\" - DAY \nPaging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page. He smiles in recognition at the familiar CODE pattern of red dots. He pulls out a PEN... \nINT. BATHROOM, \"SAFE HOUSE\" - DAY \nFrank examines a sleek, tiny electric razor that resembles a lollipop. Turning it on, he applies it. Pleased, he keeps shaving. \nGetting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette towels. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM, \"SAFE HOUSE\" - DAY \nIn the closets are dozens of flawless, custom-tailored suits. \nFlipping through the rack like a discerning shopper, Frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy. Elegant and simple. \nIN THE MIRROR \nFrank struggles to close Alexander Pearce's pants around his lightly padded mid-section... a little too tight. \nFrank is irritated to discover he's not quite as trim as Pearce. \nON THE BEDROOM FLOOR \nFrank engages himself in a spontaneous program of CALISTHENICS. He struggles through a batch of push-ups, then sit ups. \nIN THE MIRROR \nFrank flosses his teeth. Then he backs up, taking in his outfit. The lines of the suit highlight his frame. \nHe likes what he sees. \nINT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nDemidov is getting dressed. It's an elaborate ritual: carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar, etc. \nHis two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention, watching him. \nDEMIDOV When I was a young man, times were very hard. When an opportunity presented itself, you took it. \nHe pats talcum powder on himself.    The men remain stone- faced. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) I was twelve years old when Gregor asked me if I was ready for a man's job. He was the top chelovek in our housing block. So I said yes. He gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him. \nHe points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table and snaps his fingers. Scarface hands them to him. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) Now it just so happened this boy was a friend of mine. I did not want to do this terrible thing. But when you come from the streets, you have no choice. \nHe carefully knots his tie in the mirror. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) I worked   very hard for years to get past   that life. So I would not have   to do these terrible things.    So I would have a choice... \nHe turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard.    He gestures toward the man's holstered pistol -- \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) I have people like you to do these things for me... \nHe holds out his hand; THICK NECK hands him the pistol. \n", "test2_id": 2854, "test3_input": "DEMIDOV (CONT'D) Except that you don't! \nSuddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face! \nBlood explodes from THICK NECK's nose.     He falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain. \nScarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust. \nDEMIDOV (CONT'D) If you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit. \nHe turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY \nHeels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani. She checks her watch. Then walks faster. \nShe passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat) floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo. \nCara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant. \nINT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY \nFrom a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a TABLE between the pool and the lagoon. \nHis eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel. \nHe leaves the window. \nINT. TRANSPORTO - DAY \nThere is a small cabin on the deck. \nInside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle. \nAckerman stares out the tinted window. \nACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the table. \nEXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY \nFanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps... \nOver her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool. \nShe turns away. \nINT. TRANSPORTO - DAY \nSquinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements. \n- A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes roaming the palazzo. \n- A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear. \n- An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara. \nAnd an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his earpiece. \nHe speaks into the air. \nAGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.) (from the speakers) Eh, we do not know any further...characteristics? \nACKERMAN (pressing a button) You know what we know. \nEXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's table... \nIN THE TRANSPORTO \nStanding up, Ackerman holds his hand up. \nACKERMAN (into the speaker) Hold...wait for my signal... \nAT THE RESTAURANT \nCara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant man approaching. \nThe WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table... \n", "test3_true": "IN THE TRANSPORTO \nAckerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it. He's quietly furious. \nACKERMAN What is that fool doing in the middle of my operation? \nAT THE RESTAURANT \nCara stares slack-jawed at Frank. \nHe has given himself a complete make-over.    New haircut. Pearce's suit fits him well. \nHe looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering her composure. \nFRANK Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face. \nCARA (quietly) I don't know what you're talking about. Please go, I'd like to have a quiet coffee. \nFrank sits at the table with Cara and eats a CASHEW. \nIN THE TRANSPORTO \nAckerman barks whispered orders into the speaker: \nACKERMAN (frustrated) Move off. Move off. \nThe UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's table. \nAckerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's angry expression. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) (talking to the screen) Get rid of him! \nAT THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT \nDefiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara.    He signals to a different THIN WAITER. \nFRANK (to the waiter) Caffe, per favore? \nFrank turns back to Cara, who calls out-- \nCARA Cameriere!   No caffe for signor! \nFRANK (contradicting her) With milk! \nShe stares at him. \nCARA Do you want to be dead? \nFRANK Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm finished. \nFrank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.   He lights it, smoking while he talks. \nFRANK (CONT'D) When I first saw the name I got scared: \"Alexander Pearce.\" He even sounds like some super cool master criminal with Russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend... he probably works out. He might own a pizza shop on the side for all I know. \nFrank frowns at the cigarette. \nFRANK (CONT'D) These are disgusting. \nINT. TRANSPORTO - DAY \nGoyal is seated at the communication station. \nON THE MONITOR - Frank is settled in opposite Cara. \nGOYAL He's not going anywhere. \nAckerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going to see something different. \nACKERMAN Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest-- escort him out. \nEXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY \nCara looks all around.   No sign of any suitor approaching. \nCLOSE ON: the hands of the THIN WAITER, who sprinkles pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. He then platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder. \nCARA Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into. \nFRANK Probably not. But I'm doing it anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed. It was his idea, right? (MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) He told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he? \n", "test3_id": 2855}

He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives-- with a tearing sound. \nFrank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers. \nFRANK I'm... sorry. \nCara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment. \nCARA It doesn't matter. \nFRANK Maybe I should let you do this-- \nCARA Don't give up so quickly. \nReluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch. \nFirst her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward. No sign of anything underneath. \nFrank is practically sweating. \nFinally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat. \nCara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever. \nCARA (CONT'D) Thanks. \nAnd settles back into her seat, cat-like. He stares at her for several moments, at a loss for words. \nFRANK My name is Frank. \nCARA Cara. \nA white-jacketed STEWARD arrives. \nSTEWARD (to Frank) Will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur? \nFRANK Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not actually-- \nCARA The dining car would be lovely, thank you. \nThe steward nods and disappears.    Frank just stares. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET \nThe Orient Express plows through the Alps. PUSH IN ON a window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic, candlelit table eating dinner. \nINT. DINING CAR - EVENING \nLinen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket. \nFrank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then another and another... \nHe takes one or two pills from each and swallows them methodically. She watches him. \nCARA Are you ill? \nFRANK What?   No. \nShe looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Just nervous.    I don't like travelling. \nCARA (gently mocking) So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express? \nHe hesitates. \nFRANK I'm on my honeymoon. \nCARA Your honeymoon? \nCara is annoyed at this revelation. \nCARA (CONT'D) Should we ask the waiter to set another place? \nFRANK She's in Pennsylvania. \n", "test1_true": "FRANK (CONT'D) You're sure you want to hear this? \nCARA If you'd like to tell me. \nFRANK Two weeks ago she left me. For the owner of a pizza parlor. \nCARA That's awful. \nFrank nods, matter-of-fact. \nFRANK No travel insurance. No refund on the tickets. So... here I am. On my honeymoon. \nCARA I'm sorry, Frank. \nFRANK I really loved that pizza too. \"Bala Pizza\" if you're ever in Rosemont. \nCARA I wouldn't touch it.    I'm loyal to you. \nA waiter delivers their drinks. \nWAITER A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And for Monsieur... a \"Miller Light.\" \nFRANK Thanks. \nThe waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them.    Cara seems amused by Frank's obliviousness. \nFRANK (CONT'D) What takes you to Venice? \nShe nods toward his well-thumbed paperback. \nCARA You read spy novels. (playful) (MORE) \nCARA (CONT'D) I'm a mysterious woman on a train. You tell me what my story is. \nFRANK Okay... you'd be a diplomatic attach\u00e9 or... let's see... a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents. They're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. There's usually a microchip involved. \nCARA What awaits me? \nFRANK Trouble, certainly. \nCARA Danger? \nFRANK No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters. \nCARA Is there a man in my life? \nBeat. \nCARA (CONT'D) Or a candidate for the job? \nHe gazes at her with a glimmer of hope. She's insanely out of his league. But she's the one flirting with him. \nFRANK Maybe. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARIS, ILE DE LA CIT\u00c9 - EVENING \nThe magnificent Prefecture de Police on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9. A convoy of black Mercedes arrives. \nINT. INTERPOL OFFICES, PARIS - EVENING \nFootsteps echo in the grand marble hallways. \nJOHN ACKERMAN moves down the hall with purpose. British, Interpol chief inspector. He's the kind of man who commands respect (think Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive.) \nMELISSA JONES, his American counterpart matches him step for step. \nJONES We're putting a lot resources into this investigation, John. Tell me you're going to get him this time. \nACKERMAN (dry) We're going to get him this time, Ms. Jones. \nGOYAL, (Ackerman's Deputy) closes his cell phone. \nGOYAL She's on the train. They'll be in Venice in the morning. \nINT. INTERPOL CENTRAL BRIEFING ROOM, PARIS - EVENING \nBehind the ornate, 17th century doors is a high-tech amphitheater style briefing room. All glass and steel. \nSuited bureaucrats and officers from all over Europe listen to Ackerman as he leads the meeting from the podium. \n", "test1_id": 2853, "test2_input": "INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the car. \nFrank sits in a daze.   He turns to her. \nFRANK Do I look that much like Alexander Pearce? \nCara turns sharply. \nCARA How do you know--? \nFrank holds up his wrist. \nFRANK The watch. \nShe hesitates.   A pause. \nCARA I don't know. You're about his size. That's all. \nFRANK (incredulous) You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like? \nCARA Alexander crossed a very dangerous man. He changed his appearance in order to vanish. \nFRANK Great. \nCARA Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe. \nFRANK We should go to the police. \nCARA Because they did such a good job protecting you before? \nFrank doesn't respond. \nCARA (CONT'D) Trust me. \nFrank looks at her. Then relents, leaning his head back against the support and closing his eyes. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF VENICE - MORNING \nThe car is parked along a muddy canal. Beside it runs a small disconnected set of palazzos. Cara shakes Frank. He won't wake up. \nCARA Frank... Frank. \nHe's snoring.   She pinches his nose closed... \nHe startles awake.   She smiles mischievously. \nON A SIDE STREET \nHe follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men sitting on stone steps. \nFRANK And I thought I wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing. \nFrank steps over a greenish puddle. \nCARA Here we are. \nShe pauses before a run-down palazzo. \nINT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - NIGHT \nThe narrow hall is dark and shabby. \nCara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing.     She opens it with a key. \nINT. PEARCE'S \"SAFE HOUSE\" - NIGHT \nIt is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver in the darkness. The sound of a hand bumping against a wall. \nFinally somebody finds the light switch and-- \nCARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her. \nFrank happens to be right in her line of sight.   He flinches. \nFRANK Whoa! \nCARA Sorry. \n", "test2_true": "Cara starts to giggle.   Frank starts to laugh too. \nINT. KITCHEN, PEARCE'S \"SAFE HOUSE\" - NIGHT \nThe apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and then never set foot in again. Brand new appliances that have never been used. \nFrank walks over to a flat screen TV and curiously peels off the protective clear film... He looks up and sees: \nCara has her head inside the OVEN. \nFRANK What are you doing? \nShe pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth. \nCARA Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines. \nFrank watches her walk over to the FUSE BOXES. \nMINUTES LATER \nFrank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed fruit from orchards in France. \nHe opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish.     He pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is labelled \"BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07\". \nFRANK He goes Barracuda fishing? \nCara has poured herself a glass of wine. \nCARA He goes Marlin fishing. You catch the Barracudas by accident. \nFrank looks at the steak... \nINT. DINING AREA, PEARCE'S \"SAFE HOUSE\" - LATER \nCLOSE ON THE FISH -- now seasoned, grilled and surrounded by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds. \nFrank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine at Pearce's oak table. She looks appreciatively at her plate. \nCARA And she left you for a cook? \nFrank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine.   Cara takes a bite. \nCARA (CONT'D) Mmmmm!   That's decadent. \nFRANK With these ingredients, it's not hard. \nFrank savors a bite of his meal. \nFRANK (CONT'D) You know something? Food tastes better after you've been shot at. \nCara laughs.   She clinks his glass. \nCARA I'm glad I decided to come back for you, Frank Taylor. \nThey watch one another eat for several moments. \nFRANK Can I ask you a question. \nShe sets down her fork.   Leans back. \nFRANK (CONT'D) What's it like? Being a criminal? \nCARA (scoffs) I'm not a criminal. \nFRANK You carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers... I hate to break it to you, but-- \nCARA Okay, I'm a criminal. \nShe takes a big gulp of wine.     Moves over to the sofa. \nCARA (CONT'D) I didn't mean for things to turn out like this. I always lived by a certain code. But then... I broke it. \nShe lapses into silence.    Frank comes and sits beside her. \nFRANK For Alexander Pearce? \nShe doesn't answer.   Which is an answer. \nFRANK (CONT'D) What's he like? \nA beat. \n", "test2_id": 2854, "test3_input": "Surprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a finger to her lips. \nShe hesitates... looks at him questioningly. But she doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra... \n...and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE. With a sharp tug, he rips it free. He tosses it across the room. \nThen he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear: \nFRANK (a British accent) You're wrong. I'm here. \nShe straightens up.   Her heart skips a beat. \nFRANK (CONT'D) It's me.   I'm here. \nShe covers her mouth.   Her eyes mist over with tears. \nShe runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement. Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face. \nHer mind reels... \nThen their lips meet. They kiss. And kiss.      Like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert. \nFinally she pulls away and looks at him. \nCARA Why? \nFRANK You said I'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if I did tell the truth... This was the only way to convince you. (pause) The truth is that I love you. All that matters is that you believe me. \nShe stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at her without a trace of deception. She believes. \nThey hear voices on the stairs below. \nFrank holds up a finger to her-- wait. \nFrank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor. \nFrank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie. \nFrank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT \nTRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs. \nHe leads the team into the PENTHOUSE. \nHe looks around at the mess as the agents fan out. \nCara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit. \nACKERMAN Cara... I want the paramedics to make sure you're all right-- \nShe blows right past him.     Ackerman calls out after her. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Cara... \nShe pauses.   Turns to face him. \nAckerman looks down for a moment, ashamed. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about this later. \nCARA No we won't. There's nothing to talk about. I don't work for you anymore. \nShe walks past him.    For a moment Ackerman and Frank look at one another. \nACKERMAN Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go. \nHe looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) It seems I underestimated you. \nFRANK (American accent) It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman. \nWith that, Frank steps out of the room.    Ackerman's attention is distracted by-- \nGOYAL Sir... over here. Take a look at this! \nGoyal has found the safe.   Ackerman comes over and looks. \n", "test3_true": "Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the contents. \nWhile they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the BIO-METRIC LOCK. \nACKERMAN He was here. \nJones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen. \nGOYAL Account numbers... access codes... unless I'm mistaken... he left the money behind. \nJEAN LUC A mistake perhaps? \nJONES How much is there? \nGoyal scans down to a total... \nGOYAL Looks like 744 million. \nJONES That's no mistake... (walks over) That's his tax bill. \nShe holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed the FLASH DRIVE. \nJONES (CONT'D) I'll take that. \nShe slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman. \nAckerman has moved away. He's staring down at the ground -- from behind he looks like a man defeated. \nJONES (CONT'D) Well John... with the funds recovered, I don't think there's going to be any appetite from our side to continue this investigation. \nAckerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's dead body on the ground. Jones puts a hand on his back, consoling him. \nJONES (CONT'D) I'm sorry you didn't get your man. \nThen Ackerman turns... a big smile on his face. \nACKERMAN Oh but I did get my man, Ms. Jones. \nShe realizes; he was after Demidov all along. \nAckerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) Mr. Goyal, you may place Mr. Quinn under arrest now. \nQuinn is taken completely off guard. Before he can move, Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) (to Quinn) What? You thought I didn't know? You were unwittingly quite helpful; without you Mr. Demidov might have escaped justice. \nHe turns to Jones with a smile. \nACKERMAN (CONT'D) After all, Demidov wasn't a target of this investigation, was he? \nAckerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away. \nACKERMAN'S POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in the street below. \nA WATER TAXI approaches. \nJONES There's something I don't understand... how did Pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing? And where did he go? \nAckerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect. \nFrank gives him a little smile.   Cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat. \nCLOSE ON ACKERMAN:   his eyes narrow.   He knows. \nFor a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself, a small smile creeps over his face too. \nACKERMAN Because Pearce was cleverer than all of us. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WATER TAXI - NIGHT \nCara and Frank step on board. \nThe DRIVER starts the engine. \nHe turns to REVEAL... that he is the \"ENGLISHMAN\" we've seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one another for a moment. \nTHE ENGLISHMAN $20 million dollars worth of surgery and that's the face you chose? \n", "test3_id": 2855}

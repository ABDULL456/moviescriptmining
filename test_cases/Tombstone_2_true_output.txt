EXT - DESERT PLATEAU - DAY 
Wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing closer: 
MCMASTERS That's Ringo out front.  And There's Behan.  Must be 30 of 'em. What the hell... they're wearin' Badges. 
They all exchange looks of disbelief, then: 
WYATT Mounts're getting jaded.  We're Gonna have to find a place to Rest 'em up. 
Suddenly looking very sick, Doc sways dizzily in the saddle. Wyatt dismounts, reaching for him.  The others do the same: 
WYATT Doc... 
DOC Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on... 
Doc turns his horse, as if to ride on, then faints dead away. 
WYATT Grab him. 
They all catch him, easing him to the ground as.... 
EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - DAY 
Wyatt's group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house Vermillion keeping Doc in the saddle.  Hooker and 3 of his hands rides out to them: 
WYATT Horse're pretty well fagged and We got a sick man with us. 
HOOKER You can put up at my ranch if you want. 
Wyatt nods.  Hooker motions down the hill toward his house.... 
INT- BEDROOM, HOOKER'S RANCH - LATE DAY 
Doc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in sweat.  The others look on, worried.  Hooker shakes his head: 
HOOKER I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad. 
His face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc. McMasters motions to the others.  They file out, leaving Wyatt alone with his friend.... 
EXT - HILL OVERLOOKING CROSSROADS - SUNSET 
Grounds and Hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the Whetstones. 
HUNT What's it gonna be, brother? 
GROUNDS I don't care.  Colorado, New Mexico, 'long as we're out of the Territory. 
Suddenly a STAGECOACH comes into view, making its winding way through the crossroads below.  Hunt points, grinning: 
HUNT Just what we need.  Travelin' money. 
They spur their horses down the hill, drawing their guns.... 
EXT - COWBOY CAMP # 2 - NIGHT 
The Cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the Whetstones. They look up as the stage rolls up and stops.  Shouting and commotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with the driver, then Behan turns to Ringo: 
BEHAN Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and Killed a passenger.  One of 'em Rode a Mexican saddle, the other Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt. 
Behan opens the door.  Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the troupe.  Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life.  Breakenridge gasps: 
BREAKENRIDGE Oh, no... 
JOSEPHINE We're headed for a booking in Denver.  They tried to take my Watch.  He cursed them for cowards And they shot him.  He may've been Vain and an actor but he was Better than all of you.  And Gentler and braver.  I don't Understand any of this, I only Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly And he was beautiful, he tried to Put something fine into your ugly World and you killed him for it. Anyway the ones who did it are headed north.  Not that you care. 
Ringo shrugs.  His soft face suddenly turning resolute. Breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts. 
BEHAN Where're you going?  Get back here! 
The little deputy straightens his spectacles, turning to Behan: 
BILLY I'm sorry, sir, but we got to Have some law. 
And he rides off alone into the Whetstones.  Behan sputters, but: 
RINGO Let him go.  Who cares? 
EXT - HOOKER'S RANCH - NIGHT 
The stage is stopped out front.  The driver waters the horses and the actors mill around silently.  Wyatt and Hooker walk out: 
HOOKER Had a holdup.  Came her to water Their horses before pushin' on.

EVIL ED .Let's cut through here. 
CHARLEY No way. We want people and lights, the more the better. 
EVIL ED Look, Brewster, vampires don't exist. Haven't you gotten that through your thick head yet? 
CHARLEY What if you're wrong, Evil? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it. Would you walk down that alley then? The hair on the back of Evil Ed's neck starts to stand on end. Then he denies it. 
EVIL ED Aw, fuck you, Brewster. He takes a step toward the alley. Charley grabs him. 
CHARLEY Ed, please, just stick with us. 
EVIL ED Forget it. You may be chickenshit, but I'm not. He disappears down the alley into the darkness. Amy and Charley stare after him. She turns to Charley. 
AMY What do we ' do?.. 
CHARLEY Â¢ Let him go. No vampire's gonna want hint anyway.. Probably give him blood poisoning. They're about to turn away when a blood curdling SCREAM ECHOES out of the darkness of the alleyway. It's Evil Ed. Charley and Amy dash headlong into the alley after him. 
83 INT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
They speed through the darkness, skidding to a halt on the shadow slick pavement, looking around. 
CHARLEY Where is he? Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall. 
AMY Over here. 
I They dash to him, kneeling by his side. Evil Ed's eyes are closed, his breathing shallow. Charley tries to shake him awake. 
CHARLEY Ed, Ed, are you all right? Nothing from Evil Ed. Charley looks at Amy. 
CHARLEY Jesus, I warned him -- Evil Ed's eyes suddenly snap open, staring up wildly at Charley. 
EVIL ED He got me, Charley. He bit me. (grabbing him by 
THE LAPELS) You know what you're gonna have to do, don't you? (as Charley shakes his head, really scared) Kill me, Charley. Kill me before I turn into a vampire and -- He suddenly heaves himself.at Charley, his mouth opening, going for his throat as Charley jerks back, terrified. 
EVIL ED Give you a hickey! He suddenly lets Charley go, rolling on the pavement and laughing like a maniac, perfectly all tight. Charley springs to his feet, furious with him. 
CHARLEY You asshole, you fucking asshole! Evil Ed rolls on the ground in hysterics, pointing at him, and laughing loudly. 
(CONTINUED) 
83 CONTINUED: 
EVIL ED Ha, hah, really fooled you. (climbing to his feet and dusting 
HIMSELF OFF) You really believed me, you poor dope! 
CHARLEY (flushed with anger) You'll get yours someday, Evil. He grabs Amy's hand and walks back down the alley toward the street and the lights. Evil Ed yells after him. 
EVIL ED 
(MOCKINGLY) Yeah., when? When I'm bit by a vampire? There are no such things as vampires, you fruit cake! Still chuckling to himself, he turns in the opposite direc- tion and-disappears down the alleyway into the darkness. A moment passes; nothing but silence. Then Jerry Dandrige steps out from a shadowy wall where it would be impossible for any mortal to have concealed himself. It's almost as though he materializes out of the night. He stares after Charley and Amy and then slowly turns to stare in the opposite direction after Evil Ed. He slowly walks in that direction. 
83A EXT. FARTHER DOWN THE ALLEY -.NIGHT 
Evil Ed walks along, feeling safe and secure. And then he hears it, FOOTSTEPS behind him, coming through the dark slowly toward him. He turns and looks back. 
EVIL ED Charley, Amy, that you? He hears nothing but those FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER.and CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps forward, yelling out with false bravery. 
EVIL ED If that's. you, it isn't working. I'm not scared! And then Jerry emerges out of the shadows, smiling at him. With a scream, Evil Ed turns and runs. 
bl Rev. 10/9/84 62. 
83B EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ALLEY - NIGHT 
Evil Ed runs like he's never run before,â¢pounding through the dark, smashing into traffic cans and falling to the ground, leaping to-his feet, ignoring his skinned hands and bruised knees, running for his life and knowing it. 
83C EXT. DEAD END NIGHT 
He suddenly skids to a halt, facing a brick wall. He whirls, his breath-coming in ragged gasps now, peering down the alleyway into the dark, listening to those FOOTSTEPS getting closer and closer. He slowly backs away until he has no further to go his back against the brick wall, on the verge of hysteria. 
EVIL ED No, no -- The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP. Nothing but silence. The seconds tick past. He takes a step away from the wall, peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up. A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch away.

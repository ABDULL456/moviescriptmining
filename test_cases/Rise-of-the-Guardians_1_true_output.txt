The Guardians plummet through Bunny's tunnels. 
INT. BUNNYMUND'S WARREN 
Jack, Bunny and Tooth arrive gracefully in the warren's antechamber, while North and the yetis comes to a crashing halt. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 79. 
NORTH (CHUCKLES) "Buckle up." Is very funny. 
BUNNYMUND Welcome to the warren-- 
Bunny stands before them when suddenly, he shifts his attention. He turns, his ears perk up and his nose sniffs the air. 
BUNNYMUND Something's up. 
Something's amiss. A faint scream begins to echo from within the depths of one of Bunny's egg tunnels. Tiny eggs come scuttling out from the tunnel. 
Bunny grabs his boomerang, North draws his sword, and Jack readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps, screams, and the rustling of foliage grows louder. 
BUNNYMUND Ahhhh! 
Bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel. At his side are the Guardians, yetis, and sentinel eggs all bellowing their loudest battle cries until...Sophie bursts out. All momentum comes to a halt. 
JACK Sophie? 
They immediately withdraw their weapons, mildly embarrassed. Sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves. 
SOPHIE Elf, elf, elf! 
BUNNYMUND What is SHE doing HERE!!? 
North looks down at his coat pocket - ooops. 
NORTH (EMBARRASSED) Ah, snow globe. 
BUNNYMUND Crikey! Somebody do something! 
JACK Don't look at me, I'm invisible, remember? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 80. 
Sophie giggles as she drags the elf by the bell atop its uniform. 
TOOTH (CONFIDENT) Don't worry, Bunny. I bet she's a fairy fan. (flies up to Sophie) It's okay little one. 
SOPHIE (TO TOOTH) Pretty! 
TOOTH Awww! You know what, I got something for you. Here it is. (she pulls something out) Look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them. 
Sophie runs away screaming. 
JACK (LAUGHS) Blood and gums? When was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids? 
Meanwhile, Sophie is running around the warren, exploring and playing. Sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel. 
SOPHIE Peek-a-boo. 
NORTH We are very busy bringing joy to children! We don't have time... (EMBARRASSED) ...for children. 
Jack walks toward her, forming a SNOWFLAKE, which floats over toward Sophie. She tries to grab at it. 
JACK If one little kid can ruin Easter, then...we're in worse shape than I thought. 
Sophie follows the snowflake as Jack leads it over to Bunny. 
SOPHIE Weeee! Weee, weee, weee! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 81. 
The snowflake lands on Bunny's nose and his concerns suddenly seem to slip away. Jack's magic is taking affect. 
INT. BUNNYMUND'S WARREN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Close up on a flower, that opens to reveal an egg. The egg stands up wobbly on its spindly little legs. We pull out to reveal Sophie and Bunny's faces looking on, Sophie amazed, Bunny proud. 
BUNNYMUND You wanna paint some eggs? Yeah? 
SOPHIE Okay! 
BUNNYMUND Come on then! 
We pull out further to reveal a massive stone spire, covered in moss, as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side of it toward a green meadow. North and Jack stand in the midst of it all, slack-jawed, as the eggs rush towards them. 
NORTH Rimsky Korsakov! That's a lot of eggs. 
JACK Uh, how much time do we have? 
A GREEN MEADOW 
SOPHIE Weeeeee! 
BUNNYMUND Woooohoooo! 
Bunny hops into view, Sophie clinging to his back smiling, leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide PATH. As he passes, FLOWERS BLOOM on either side in his wake, BLASTING the passing eggs with color as they go. 
BUNNYMUND (V.O.) Alright troops, it's time to push back. That means eggs! Everywhere! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 82. 
THE SORTING STONES 
North looks out over the eggs as they get sorted. 
NORTH (WALLA) Single file! 
Sophie, on her back, is carried by the eggs through the sorting stones. She giggles as North waves at her while she passes by.

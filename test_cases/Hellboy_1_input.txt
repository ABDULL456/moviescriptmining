HELLBOY "One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. 
MANNING When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. 
MANNING shows them a set of GRENADE BELTS. 
MANNING We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use... 
HELLBOY (interrupts) Those things never work. Never. 
MANNING Each of us gets a belt. 
HELLBOY (shrugs it off) I won't take 'em. They never work. 
Manning looks at Hellboy, irate.

Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark. 
LIZ'S VOICE (on radio) We're leaving the main road, so hang on --

HELLBOY (on the radio) This better be the place or I'll puke.

Hazel sits in her parked car and talks on her cellphone. Little kids in costumes walk by. A little girl walks by in a "nude" body suit with Olive's tattoos all over it. 
HAZEL They fired me. I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis. I didn't wash my hands. I had pink eye hands! Pink hands! 
INTERCUT WITH: 
A114 INT. WAREHOUSE - 2024 - SAME A114 
Caden sits at his desk, talking on his cell phone. 
CADEN Oh God. 
HAZEL I didn't wash my hands! I'm a stupid cow! I don't have anything to show for being on this planet. And this fucking private Christian school is killing us. It's not cheap. It's Derek's thing. I don't believe in that shit. Y'know? Try to be a good person. That's all there is. I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. Do you have anything for me, Caden?

114 INT. WAREHOUSE - AUDITION CORNER - 2025 - LATER 114 
The actors are in their apartments living their lives. Caden is in the far corner of the space, at a little sectioned-off area. There are a half-dozen actors sitting on folding chairs outside the partition. They all resemble Caden, except one very tall one. Hazel steps around the partition. 
HAZEL Sammy Barnathan? Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands. 
HAZEL (CONT'D)SAMMY This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or picture. I've never worked as an actor. 
CADEN Good. Tell me why you're here. 
SAMMY I've been following you for twenty years. So I knew about this audition. Because I follow you. Caden, hiding is nervousness, nods. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) I've learned everything about you by following you. Hire me and you will see who you truly are. Caden stares at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There's fear in Caden's eyes but he doesn't drop his gaze. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) Peek-a-boo. Sammy transforms effortlessly into Caden.

SAMMY (CONT'D) Okay, Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to anyone else. This guy has me down. I'm going to cast him right now. Then maybe you and I can get a drink and we can try to figure out this thing between us. Why I cried. I've never felt about anyone the way I feel about you. I want to fuck you until we merge into a Chimera.

SAMMY (CONT'D) A mythical beast with penis and vagina eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself. 
CADEN Yes, okay. You've got the part. Sammy nods and exits. Hazel follows him with her eyes. 
HAZEL He's good, Caden. 
CADEN Please don't fall in love with him. 
HAZEL I only have eyes for you, dear. 
115INT. WAREHOUSE - 2025 - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 115 
Caden limps with his cane and a backpack toward the men's room door. His eyes are rheumy. He pushes open the door. 
116INT. WAREHOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - 2025 - CONTINUOUS 116 
The room is filthy. Flies buzz. The urinals are covered with slime. Caden enters a stall, pulls down his pants, and sits. He strains. When he is done, he looks at his stool. It's gray. He wipes and flushes, pulls up his pants and exits the stall. Sammy stands there. 
SAMMY I've never seen your shit gray. 
CADEN It's new. Sammy jots a note. Caden places his backpack on a sink. He looks at himself in the mirror, stalling. 
SAMMY I know it's pill time. You don't need to hide from me. Caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills. He takes them, one-by-one. Sammy watches and counts. When it's over, he speaks. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) You're missing your Fosonex.

CADEN SAMMY No. Check your bag. Caden pulls out books and notebooks and a sweater. The pill falls out of the sweater onto the grimy floor. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) Fosonex, 2.5 mg. Caden picks the pill up off the floor. It's got grime on it. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) Swallow it anyway. It's important. Go on, sweetie. Caden looks at Sammy and swallows the pill. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) Good boy. 
117 EXT. NYC CITY STREET - 2025 - EVENING 117 
Caden exits the warehouse with Claire and Ariel, who is now five. Sammy walks alongside. There is a long line of people waiting to find out about tickets for the show. 
MAN When is it opening? 
CADEN When it's ready. 
MAN We need to get in. It's bad out here. They move on, passing poor people waiting in line for food distributed from a military truck. There are sick people being herded into a scary bus marked "Fun Land." The guards wear surgical masks.

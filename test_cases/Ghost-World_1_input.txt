MAXINE May I ask what you're doing? 
ENID Shhh! 
MAXINE I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death! 
ENID Oh yeah, like he even noticed. 
MAXINE Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do. 
We hear Seymour on the machine in the background... 
SEYMOUR (V.O.) I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here... 
ENID I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone! 
Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up the phone and dials. 
REBECCA (V.O.) Hello? 
ENID I need to talk to you. 
INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY 
Enid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform. 
ENID I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you. 
REBECCA I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week. 
ENID Please let me come with you. Please please please... 
REBECCA I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea. 
ENID Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan. 
REBECCA But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job. 
ENID I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off. 
INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING 
Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in. 
DAD Pumpkin, are you in there? 
ENID Are you going to yell at me? 
DAD About what? 
DAD Yeah, I heard about that. 
ENID I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days. 
DAD She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it. 
ENID I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe. 
DAD Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up. 
ENID What do you mean "on his way up"!? 
DAD I just buzzed him in. 
Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door. 
ENID What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here! 
DAD But I can't -- 
ENID JUST DO IT! 
Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room. 
DAD (V.O.) I'm not sure when she'll be back... 
Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She has a terribly sad look on her face. 
INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING 
Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes. Joe walks by the doorway. 
JOE Well, here's where the fun never stops! 
SEYMOUR Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.

EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK 
The girls have led them to a beautiful spot. 
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS -- 
we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine. 
Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET. 
EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING 
The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed toward the main building. 
INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING 
A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention. 
IN THE AUDIENCE -- 
As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles. 
JACK You ever actually read any of this guy's books? 
MILES He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted. 
JACK Huh. 
Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles protests at first, they stand and leave. 
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- 
Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside -- 
INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS. 
As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away. 
LATER -- 
In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, kissing. 
CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge of kissing but holding back. 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES... 
INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table. 
WIDE -- 
The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in LAUGHTER. 
A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his arms, and takes her back to bed. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Saab pulls away from the house. 
INT. SAAB - NIGHT 
Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab. 
EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little woozy from the hours of drinking. 
AT THE DOOR -- 
Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear? 
Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes the door in our face. 
The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS. 
MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH -- 
THURSDAY 
The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- 
INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste. 
Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops the paper on the dining table and continues into -- 
THE BEDROOM -- 
where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly. 
Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot. 
EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY 
This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.

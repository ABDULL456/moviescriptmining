Daisy is performing on stage. She gets off and heads over to Ira. 
I HA That was great. She kisses him. 
DAISY Thanks. The MANAGER walks over. 
MANAGER Hey Ira, Federman got in a car accident. Do you want to take his spot? George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age. This young man has clearly taken his place. 
GEORGE Hey, how's it going? 
IRA Hey George. 
GEORGE This is Randy. He's funny, you'd like his stuff. It's smart. 
IRA I'm sure I would. I look forward to seeing it. Are you going on tonight? 
RANDY I hope so. 
MANAGER (to George) Do you want to go up? Ira was gonna take Federman's spot, but we can get you up if you want to? 
GEORGE No, that's ok. I don't want to take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna hang out tonight. 
INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER 
Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a table by himself. On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal than we have seen before. Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused. 
ANGLE ON GEORGE He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is proud of Ira and misses him. 
INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY 
Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER Is the potato salad fresh? 
IRA I made it myself this morning. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER Is it good? 
IRA I stake my reputation on it. 
FEMALE CUSTOMER Okay. Give me a quart. 
IRA Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad. The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket. 
GEORGE Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free? 
IRA Yes we do. 
GEORGE So this is where you work. 
IRA Back in the saddle. 
GEORGE I thought we were writing a screenplay. 
IRA Well, you're not a very good writing partner. 
GEORGE Or any kind of partner. You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me? They give you breaks around here? 
INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from each other. 
GEORGE In my travels, I have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you well on your journey. Ira laughs. 
IRA That guy was a douche-bag. 
GEORGE But also kind of cool. It's a very weird combination. 
IRA He was going to heal you with those herbs, man. You get sick again, you should call that guy. 
GEORGE I think most of what you said to me was true. And I really am sorry. I think I'm still not very healthy...in my brain. 
IRA It's all right, man. You've been through a lot. 
GEORGE Well, I appreciate you trying to help me. Even though it was kind of an impossible task. 
IRA Is everything going okay? How are you doing?

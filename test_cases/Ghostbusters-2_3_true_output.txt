With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks, hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators. Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them. 
VENKMAN Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? 
WINSTON Wonder what? 
VENKMAN If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know. 
SPENGLER There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons of iron and steel. 
Stantz is looking worried. 
STANTZ I hope we have enough stuff to do the job. 
VENKMAN Only one way to find out. (to Stantz) Ready, Teddy? 
They enter the statue. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER 
The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue. Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase. They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks and gives the order. 
STANTZ Okay, boys.  Let's frost it. 
They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive slime.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
Janine watches as Louis, wearing a Ghostbuster uniform, slings a heavy proton pack onto his back. 
JANINE I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this? 
LOUIS Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum. 
JANINE You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck. 
She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious. 
LOUIS Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry. 
He rushes out. 
EXT  STREET OUTSIDE FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER) 
Louis stands on the street corner waiting for a bus.  Finally, a bus pulls up, Louis climbs aboard and finds Slimer behind the wheel. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are standing in the observation windows in the crown of the statue.  It looks like they're on the bridge of an ocean liner, then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the head of the statue. 
STANTZ 
He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer. 
STANTZ It's all yours, Pete. (checks his watch) There's not much time left. 
Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat. 
VENKMAN (giving the downbeat) Okay, one, two, three, four -- 
He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior. 
INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to the rail and manage to keep their feet. 
STANTZ She's moving! 
WINSTON I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk. 
SPENGLER (reading the Giga-meter) We've got full power. 
Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and starts pushing the buttons.

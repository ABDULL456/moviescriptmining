SHERIFF Take my friends where they want to go! 
HANK Yes, sir. 
SHERIFF Hurry up! 
BOB (Going out the window) Thanks, Pete. 
EXT. WINDOW - POLICE CAR 
Hank has thrown the door open. 
PHIL Do you think we can make it? 
HANK This thing goes over a hundred an hour!  Hold on! 
He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, and tires grinding. 
MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM 
The Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the door, takes out his key and opens it. 
MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR 
The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the departing police car, the noise having distracted them from the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating. The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to him, faces alight. 
SHERIFF They escaped!  We're pursuing 'em! 
LANDLORD Escaped! 
SHERIFF (Pointing) What do you mean smoking on theatrical premises! 
LANDLORD That's not mine!  I wasn't smoking! 
SHERIFF What's that burning?  A lollypop? (He grabs him by the shoulder, not too gently, and starts him out) Come on! 
He protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. STATION - (NIGHT) 
The train is already moving as the police car arrives. 
The girls are on the observation platform.  The police car screams to a stop.  The boys fly out, with bags, and just make the train, the girls pulling them aboard. 
JUDY (Seriously) You didn't steal the police car? 
PHIL No, no.  Friend of ours. 
They go toward the lounge car. 
MED. SHOT - INT. LOUNGE CAR - GROUP 
They all take seats in the lounge car, happy to have accomplished their escape. 
BOB Well, we'll be together as far as New York. 
BETTY Maybe it'll snow in New York for Christmas.  If it doesn't, we'll mail you a snowball from Vermont. 
JUDY I haven't been on ice skates in years.

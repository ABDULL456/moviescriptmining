Liz sits in a waiting room by herself, reading a magazine. Psst! She looks up at the camera. 
Cris (o.c.) Unscrew the vent. 
She moves a chair under the vent and prepares to stand on it. The door opens and several MP's march in. 
SOLDIER (to Liz) We're here to protect you. 
Without looking up at Cris, she moves the chair back against the wall and sits in it. 
VENTILLATION DUCT 
Cris, frustrated, shimmies back through the vent. 
SURVEILLANCE ROOM 
Leo checks all the video screens. Cris is nowhere. 
Leo He must be in the walls. 
VENTILLATION DUCT 
Settling in, Cris looks at his watch. 5:17. He concentrates and time speeds by - until a flashlight beam lights up the duct from a distance. 
SOLDIER I found him! In here! 
As more Security Police and flashlights fill the shaft, Cris checks his watch: 5:33. 
SNAPBACK: 
VENTILLATION DUCT 
Which is once again dark, quiet and empty. Cris looks at his watch. 5:17. 
Cris (to himself) Sixteen minutes. 
Cris takes a deep breath and crawls forward. Remarkably, he seems to be CRAWLING OUT OF HIS MOTIONLESS BODY like a snake shedding its skin! - In fact, Cris 1 lies there in deep concentration, while Cris 2 creeps onward. 
EXPLORATION SEQUENCE 
Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office. He opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward, preternaturally calm. 
He advances through an unfolding panorama of "stage sets" on which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of harmony and counterpoint. 
Cris encounters Security Police searching for him. When they discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him. He checks the time. Snapback a few seconds. He hides before they arrive. 
He goes through a door into a room. People are there. Snapback. Hides in a different room. It's empty. Cris searches the room. Looks in the desk drawers. Puts things in his pockets. The door flies open. Security Police find him and shoot. Snapback. 
Cris treads down empty corridors. He multiplies into a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, as he explores room after room, searching them sequentially. Simultaneously. 
He spends much time in a Handyman's Storeroom, while other Cris Johnson's fade away. 
Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge. Cris scans the room. He is seen. He waits to see who will shoot him first. He is hit in the chest. Fade out. 
Cris 35 gets caught by two Security Police. He fights them, takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements. 
Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door as his POV FAST FORWARDS, and he charts the comings and goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at which point he snapsback and hides in a different room. He's hiding in many rooms simultaneously. Spying. Piecing together the schedule of the patrol in that corridor. 
The same situations repeat. Scanning for security cameras. Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying. 
He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a landing. A second iteration of himself continues to the next floor down. At that landing, two iterations of himself turn in different directions, left and right. 
We follow the one that went to the left. 
He sees MP's taking Liz from her holding room and escorting her somewhere else. 
He follows. Gets seen. By her. By them. Snapback. 
He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the MP's will emerge with Liz. The MP's and Liz emerge from an elevator in one of the locations. The other Cris' fade out. 
Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside. Four guards depart. Two guards remain posted outside. They see Cris. 
He runs down stairs. Into the corridor. Into the room directly under the room where Liz is being held. 
Cris enters A FORENSICS LAB where the captured bomb is being studied. There is a barrel of C4 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. MP's in the room turn on him and open fire. Cris is blasted and falls to the floor, dead. Snapback to... 
VENTILLATION DUCT 
Cris, where he started, motionless as a hibernating bear, exploring his futures. CAMERA passes through walls, floors, ceilings and finds Baines rushing through the corridors. Baines enters... 
Wisdom's office 
Where Wisdom paces with one crutch while Ferris sits on a sofa like Rodin's Thinker, in concentration almost as deep as Cris'. 
Baines He hasn't gotten out through any exit. The bad news is... 
wisdOM You've lost him. 
BAINES I'm issuing infrared to all my men. We should have a fix in a few minutes. 
WISDOM You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back. He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy. 
Ferris looks up. 
FeRRIS I know how to flush him out. 
bainES (at a loss) Fine. Tell me what to do. 
The thought crystallizes as she speaks. 
FERRIS We don't actually have to do anything. (beat) We just have to decide to do something...unthinkable. 
Ferris shudders at the dark brilliance of her own idea. 
int. ground floor of facility - DAY 
Guards stand in a solid line. No way out. Cris off to one side, in a niche just inside the door. Camera pans and finds a second Cris standing back, away from an exit. Pans and finds a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, trying each exit.

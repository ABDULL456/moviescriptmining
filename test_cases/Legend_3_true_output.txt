JACK: Thank you.... 
The other faeries follow, leading the unicorn. 
53 INTERIOR MOUTH TO CAVE DAY 
An earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the unicorn. There is a small wooden door at the far end, sealed with a bright brass padlock. 
GUMP: Brown Tom. Stay here with the unicorn and guard her well. 
BROWN TOM: Like me own life! 
GUMP: Better than that! She's the last of her kind. 
Gump marches to the little wooden door. He inserts a finger into the padlock, twisting it like a key. Instantly, the pops apart. Gump opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond. 
54 INTERIOR TUNNEL DAY 
Tree roots twist down like dead men's fingers and clutch the ancient rune stones lodged in the earthen walls. 
Gump and Screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel, but Jack is forced to crawl on his hands and knees. Luna flies above thier heads like a tiny neon insect. 
GUMP: Right this way.... 
Gump pauses by another wooden door, sealed with a brass lock. He opens it instantly with his magic touch. 
SCREWBALL: Home, sweet home! 
55 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY 
Jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden chairs and tables, a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging from the ceiling. The simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles of treasure: gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins. 
GUMP: Fit for a king's ramsom! 
Jack in awe as he wades through the ankle-high loot. 
JACK: Such riches.... I feel I must be dreaming.... 
GUMP: If life is a dream, better you dread the waking! 
Screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over his head. He laughs like a child in a sandpit. 
JACK: ....beautiful.... 
GUMP: Mere trinkets.... Let's find you something useful. 
Luna's golden LIGHT streaks down and whirls around Jack's head. He swats futilely at her. 
JACK: Stop it....! Go away....! 
GUMP: Easy.... Luna only seeks a little affection. 
Luna hovers beside Jack's cheek. 
JACK: I meant no disrespect, but.... ouch! Make her stop, will you, Gump! 
GUMP: Does your blood run so cold? You'll be a corpse before your time. 
Gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full. 
JACK: What does she want from me? 
GUMP: Foolish question.... (handing Jack a goblet) Drink, and wamr your heart. The answer's at the bottom of your cup. 
Jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously. This time, he is careful not to drink when the faeries do. 
GUMP (cont): Now then.... down to business. 
Gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard. It is a remarkably beautiful weapon. 
JACK: What's this....? Something to cook with? 
Gump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look. 
GUMP(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine a weapon as you'll ever see. 
JACK(curious: So, that's a weapon.... What's it do? 
SCREWBALL: World is doomed, if you ask me. 
Screwball goes back to playing with the jewels. 
Gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt. 
GUMP: A little demonstration. 
Gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down. The little elf is an expert swordsman. He whirls the weapon in a gleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half. 
GUMP(cont): With such a blade you could behead an ogre as easily as uncapping a soft-boiled egg. 
JACK: That's really something.... Can I try? 
Gump hands the sword to Jack. 
GUMP: You're the champion, aren't you? 
Jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and tosses it into the air. As it flutters down, he swings wildly with the broadsword. Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head chopped off. 
GUMP(cont): Watch out....! You'll get the hang of it in time.... Now, we best see about some armour..... Screwball! 
SCREWBALL: Coming right up! 
Screwball flips open the lid of a chest. Folded inside is a golden chain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship.

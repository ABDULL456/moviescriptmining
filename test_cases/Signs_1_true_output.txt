MORGAN It's still making the noises.  It's broken. 
GRAHAM It's old Morgan. 
Morgan heads out of the kitchen. 
MERRILL Listen, I was out of line with that whole female Scandinavian Olympian thing. 
Edgar nods. 
MERRILL It's just that, I'm pretty strong and pretty fast.  And I was running as fast as I could.  And this guy... (embarrassed smile) He was just toying with us. 
Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches Edgar think it over. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill. 
OFFICER PASKI Could everyone just take a seat on the couch.  I have some preliminary thoughts. 
Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan. 
OFFICER PASKI There are three possibilities here. We'll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I really don't believe that's what we're looking at here.  In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. That's kind of clear. (beat) The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very slim one. (beat) I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. He's a watcher.  Someone who this is a game for.  He's laying low. Doesn't want to be seen.  But he wants to watch you.  Study you folks. 
Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next to the television. 
ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD. 
Officer Paski turns to them. 
Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen. 
OFFICER PASKI Now I don't want you all to worry about this no more.  You're making more of this than it is. (beat) You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd. (beat) Maybe you guys should do something fun?  Let me worry about this person.  Let me find out who it is and then -- What the hell are you people looking at? 
Edgar comes around to see the screen. 
WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE. 
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE FIELD. 
OFFICER PASKI I'll be damned. 
GRAHAM Turn up the volume Bo. 
Bo gets up. 
BO I can't find the remote. 
She presses the up arrows on the TV controls. 
TV ANCHOR -- images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty-four year old local camera man in Kerala, a southern city of India.  It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours. 
The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR. 
PROFESSOR (TV) Crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. They died out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. This new resurgence is wholly different.  Elements of it are unexplainable.  The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries... (beat) There is only a limited amount of explanations.  Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... (beat) It's for real. 
Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. 
MORGAN (wonder) Extraterrestrials. 
OFFICER PASKI What in God's name is going on? 
Beat. 
THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the television screen. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY 
The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car. 
OFFICER PASKI Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I can't think straight right now. I'm going back to the station. Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and try to think clear.  After that I might make some calls. (beat) Hoaxes... People got way too much time on their hands. 
Edgar turns back to Graham. 
OFFICER PASKI But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes.  You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.

JANE Can he not do God's work here? 
MARY This quiet parish will never do for him; he almost raves in his restlessness. It breaks our hearts. 
DIANA St John burns with talents and ambition. But he lacks the means for advancement here. Our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on God's altar. 
MARY We've tried to persuade him to stay but in some things our brother is - he is - 
DIANA Inexorable as death. 
MARY We are now without father. We'll soon be without home and brother. 
Jane feels a powerful compassion for them. 
JANE In one thing you are fortunate. 
She looks over at the horizon. 
JANE (CONT'D) You have each other. 
EXT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE GROUNDS. SPRING. 
Jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of her world at Lowood. Her eyes come to rest on the main door. Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the school. Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth over his mouth and nose. He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on him. He looks away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 25. 
INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - THE DORMITORY. 
Jane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress. She peers in through the dormitory door. It has been turned into a sanitarium. Camphor and vinegar are being burnt. Jane can hardly look at the sick girls. 
Miss Temple, pale with exhaustion, is speaking intimately to Madame Pierrot, the French mistress. Jane overhears. 
MISS TEMPLE This is the result of semi- starvation and neglected colds; Brockelhurst's idea of mortifying their bodies to save their souls. TYPHUS - 
Miss Temple can't say more. 
MADAME PIERROT Write to the governors. You must. 
Jane creeps on. 
INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM. 
Jane opens the door. A small bed has been set up at the foot of Miss Temple's. In it lies Helen Burns. A candle is set on a table at her side. Jane takes her hand. 
JANE Helen. 
HELEN Is it you, Jane? Have you come to say goodbye? 
JANE You're cold. 
HELEN I'm very happy. I am going home. 
JANE Back to your father? 
HELEN My father has a new wife. He'll not miss me much. 
JANE Then where? 
HELEN To my future home, where all is light. I am going to God. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 26. 
JANE No... 
Jane is devastated. She climbs into bed next to Helen. For a moment, they hold each other. Jane's tears silently fall. 
HELEN Don't be sad. I will escape great suffering by dying young. 
JANE No... 
HELEN I don't have any talent to make my way in life. I should be always at fault. But God is my friend. He loves me. 
JANE Then he must save you. 
HELEN He is saving me. 
Jane cannot articulate her distress at Helen's words. 
HELEN (CONT'D) I feel like I could sleep now. I like to have you near - 
JANE I won't leave you. 
HELEN You're so warm and alive. Jane, you have a passion for living. 
INT. DAY. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM. 
We see Miss Temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling, morning light. Jane, waking, has her small arms around Helen, as if fiercely protecting her. Helen is ashen, her eyes open, staring at some unseen thing. She is dead. Miss Temple lifts Jane away. 
MISS TEMPLE Jane... 
Jane realises what has happened. We hear the sound of her distress begin. She is inconsolable. 
JANE No, no, no - 
MARY (V.O.) Jane? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 27.

EXT. TBD - DAY 
GIL (V.O.) Look at these places - the streets - the boulevards. INEZ (V.O.) You act like you've never been here before. CONTD: 
GIL (V.O.) I don't get here often enough is the problem. Every once in a while for a few days is nothing - my biggest regret is that I didn't settle here the first time I came. I should have gone with my instincts. INEZ (V.O.) I admit it's pretty but so are so many other places I've visited. GIL If I'd have stayed the first time I came by now I'd be a Parisian. INEZ (V.O.) Starving. CUT TO: 
EXT. TBD - DAY 
(Pause here for third dialogue exchange) GIL (V.O.) I'm thinking of a painting by Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the rain. Can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain? Imagine this town in the twenties - Paris in the twenties - in the rain - the artists and writers - I was born too late. Why did God deliver me into the world in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet. INEZ (V.O.) Why does every city have to be in the rain? What's wonderful about getting wet? GIL (V.O.) It's romantic. INEZ (V.O.) It's annoying. CONTD:

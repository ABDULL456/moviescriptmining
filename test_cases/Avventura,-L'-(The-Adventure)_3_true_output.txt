From the opposite end of the corridor through which Sandro and the Lieutenant are walking, appears the Sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on which Claudia toured the islands in search of Anna. After saluting his superior, the Sergeant says: 
SERGEANT Have you any instructions for me, Lieutenant? May I return to Lipari? 
LIEUTENANT Yes. With whom did you leave the crate of cigarettes? 
SERGEANT I left it at the warehouse. 
The Sergeant again salutes his superior, then continues on his way along the corridor. Sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him. 
SANDRO Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get back? 
SERGEANT About two hours ago. 
SANDRO And the young lady who was with you? 
SERGEANT I don't know... She said she had to catch a train. 
Sandro remains a while, absorbed in his thoughts, then hurriedly leaves the building, and heads towards the station. 
On her way to the waiting room of the station, Claudia purchases a newspaper, then goes over to an empty bench and sits down. Turning to the local news section, she suddenly comes upon the article announcing Anna's disappearance. 
A moment later, Sandro appears at the door. Claudia looks up at him but doesn't say a word. He walks over and sits down beside her. 
SANDRO Where are you going?... To Montaldo's? 
CLAUDIA Yes. 
SANDRO Then I'll go with you. 
There is a moment of silence, then Claudia shows him the newspaper article. 
CLAUDIA Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them. 
SANDRO Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them... 
CLAUDIA Yes, you should go. 
SANDRO But then when will we see each other? 
Claudia looks at him imploringly, intent on making him understand, without having to tell him outright, that it is not a question of their seeing each other. Sandro, of course, does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room. Claudia, in turn, also rises and goes over to him. 
CLAUDIA I know it's difficult. But if you go on like this it will become even more difficult. 
The bell announcing the train's arrival is sounded. Sandro turns around and faces Claudia, almost with a sense of helpless despair. 
CLAUDIA Please, don't look so solemn... And don't wait for the train to come in. 
But Sandro doesn't move. And again Claudia insists, imploring him not to stay, although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye. 
CLAUDIA Please, please leave. I don't want to look out of the window and wave to you with a handkerchief. 
Sandro still doesn't move, and is about to say something, but Claudia looks at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression, that he finally succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks.

Together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing tail... 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Hold on! 
And shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it! 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! We did it! 
They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago, kicking up a trail of dust. 
Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a javelin, and sticking it in the ground between Drago and his weapon, singeing his outstretched hand. 
DRAGO Agghh! 
HICCUP Hold him there Toothless! 
Toothless SNARLS a warning, ready to blast. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) It's all over now. 
But the cloud of dust settles, revealing the Bewilderbeast, rising behind Hiccup, ready to blast him instead. 
DRAGO 
(GRINNING KNOWINGLY) Or is it? 
Hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a RUSH of water THUNDERS up the Bewilderbeast's throat. 
HICCUP Oh, no! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92. 
It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both. 
Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it desperately. 
VALKA No! No... 
ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She realizes what is about to happen and backs away. 
A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it. Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled safely under his wings. 
Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage, his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow emanating from his flared nostrils. 
He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring ferociously. 
The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face, not letting up. 
HICCUP He's challenging the alpha! 
VALKA To protect you. The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination. Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control. 
The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire, continuing his unrelenting attack. 
In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to witness Toothless' retaliation. 
Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind Toothless. 
Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the Bewilderbeast. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93. 
DRAGO No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight! 
FIGHT! 
Drago clambers up the Bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged. 
DRAGO (CONT'D) (to the defecting dragons) What's the matter with you? 
The Berkians swell in to show their unified support. Drago fumes as Hiccup and Toothless fly up together onto an ice spire. 
HICCUP Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty. 
(BEAT) Let this end now. 
DRAGO Never! Come on! 
He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

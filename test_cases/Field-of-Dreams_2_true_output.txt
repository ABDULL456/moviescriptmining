MANN The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an`army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this Â° game... it's a piece of our past. It reminds us of all that once was good. And that could be again. People will come. People will most definitely come. Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud. 
BUCK WEAVER 
(TEARY-EYED) That was beautiful... The other players nod, also teary-eyed.

141 CONTINUED 141 
BUCK WEAVER 
(SINCERELY) .fuckin' beautiful. The players on either side of him jab his ribs with their elbows, but Mann, Ray and Annie laugh with pleasure. 
MARK Ray. You will lose everything and you will be evicted. Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he turns back to Mark. It's decision time. 
RAY I'm not signing. Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles. 
MANN Ray... Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head, directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him toward the house. 
142 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW - CARS 142 have parked in front of the house. More are coming quietly down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state license plates. Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates. 
143 THE BLEACHERS 143 Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are deeply happy -- but not terribly surprised -- to see these people. 
RAY 
(SING-SONG) They're he-re. Mark looks at the house and then back at Ray. 
NARK Who's here? 
CONTINUED 
143 CONTINUED 
RAY (with an edge) You don't see those cars? All those people? 
MARK Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people... 
KARIN Uncle Mark, I can see them. 
ANNIE We all can. 
MARK You're crazy. You're all bat-shit crazy! 
RAY Watch your language, Mark. 
MARK You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere, you sit around here and stare at nothing --- 
KARIN It's not nothing. Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she were "Exhibit A." 
MARK And you've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron! 
RAY Get your hands off her. Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so doing, he twists little Karin off balance. 
MARK I'm trying to help you, goddamnit! In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers. 
RA Y Karin!! 
144 KARIN 
Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards of one of the bottom rows. 
145 THE OTHERS 
rush down to where she lies, face up. Ray is first, but he does not know what to do. Annie and Mann hover. Mark is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do. 
MARK Oh my God, I'm sorry...Annie...I didn't mean to... Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath. Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish. 
ANNIE Should we move her? 
RAY Get the car. 
146 ANNIE 
springs for the house. The tourists by their cars watch quietly. 
ANNIE Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of you? They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside. 
147 BACK AT THE BLEACHERS 
Most of the White Sox players stand by the left field fence, staring silently.

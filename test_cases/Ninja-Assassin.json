Meeting in the middle of the hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their training. \nTheir weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on steel. Neither giving an inch. Evenly matched in skill and ferocity. Locking together for a moment Takeshi smiles. \nTAKESHI (CONT'D) No death tasted as sweet as hers. \nRaizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks again. \nTakeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low beneath Raizo's swinging chain as -- \n-- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking Takeshi's attack, but -- \n-- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. As he brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain around the blade and locks it tight. \nBoth men spin in their sudden embrace.   Faces inches from each other. \nTAKESHI (CONT'D) I watched you die when I pierced her heart. You have always been too weak to be Ozunu. \nTakeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   90. 116   CONTINUED:                                                116 \nThe blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of steel jolts out from the hilt of Takeshi's sword. \nHe moves to slam it into Raizo's side...but Raizo FLIPS over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he -- \n-- DRIVES the steel into Takeshi's heart. He still stands for a BEAT, more by inertia than will, then slumps, dead, to the floor. \nRaizo stalks down the hall.    One last task ahead of him. \n117   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR/MASTERS      117 ROOM/ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT \nRaizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody footprints moving soundlessly. \nFrom the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice \nOZUNU You have not forgotten your training. You will always be mine, child. \nRaizo stops, considers this, then continues; his footsteps now bringing every sound possible. \nOzunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off a cloak of midnight. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Perhaps this is the best way for you to die. \nHis blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain blade begins to spin. \nRAIZO The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life. \nRaizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the power of an enormous buzz saw-- \nHacking timbers in half-- \nCarving scars in the floors and walls-- \nBraziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but-- \nOzunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently \n", "test3_id": 398}

{"train": "NINJA ASSASSIN \nWritten by \nMatthew Sand & J. Michael Straczynski \nREVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08 \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin, raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the precision of ritual. \nThe tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon. The image has beauty but retains the violence required to saturate flesh with art. \nThe skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle- work. \nHOLLYWOOD Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck! \nPULL BACK to reveal that we're in... \n1   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT                                      1 \nA place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos. \nHOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first tattoo, a relatively small one on his back. \nHe grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby. \nHOLLYWOOD Watch it, old man! \nThe old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.       Maybe a little harder. \nHOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) What the fuck?     You're doing it wrong. \nTATTOO ARTIST The needle is doing what the needle does. \nHOLLYWOOD What's that supposed to mean? \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08        2. 1   CONTINUED:                                                        1 \nTATTOO MASTER The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited. \nHOLLYWOOD What did you just say, old man? \nHollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old man's jaw. \nHOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) I know you didn't just disrespect me, did you? You that fucking stupid? You disrespect me, and I'll tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains! \nThe old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through years of service to men like Hollywood. \nTATTOO MASTER No disrespect. \nHollywood smiles. \nHOLLYWOOD You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking? \nGoons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus. Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an origami envelope. \nHOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck. \nYAKUZA ONE Hey, boss. This just came for you. \nHOLLYWOOD What is it? \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08      3. 1   CONTINUED: (2)                                                1 \nYAKUZA ONE A letter. \nHOLLYWOOD So open it, dumb ass. \nHe opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he sees. \nHOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) What?   What is it? \nHe pours the contents out into his hand. \nYAKUZA ONE Looks like sand. \nHe tastes it. \nYAKUZA ONE (CONT'D) Yup. Sand. Black Sand. \nThe tattoo master drops his brush.     It clatters to the floor. \nTATTOO MASTER No... \nCUT TO: \n2   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                      2 \nA roll of toilet paper drops into a cart. PULL BACK to REVEAL RAIZO, 20s, slim and sinewy, his expression distant, almost haunted. He considers the toothpaste options for a moment, then drops in one of those too. Moves on to food. \nTurkish Muzak plays in the background, a Beatles song, \"Helter Skelter\" by way of Turkish musicians. Other SHOPPERS cruise past in their own private quests. \nRaizo gets quick, easy bachelor food: six eggs, a single stick of butter, several handfuls of noodle packages. \n3   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT - MOMENTS LATER      3 \nRaizo waits while the CHECKER - a pretty young woman - tallies up his groceries. \nCHECKER That's a lot of noodles. (beat) Are you a student? Tourist?   Here on business? \nRaizo shakes his head to all three. \nCHECKER (CONT'D) When was the last time someone cooked you a real meal? (beat) I get off at seven.

Very cute. \nRAIZO I don't think so. Sorry. \nNo smile. No emotion in Raizo's face. He pays in cash. He picks up the bag and starts away when -- \nCHECKER So if you're not a student, and you're not a tourist, and you're not here to work... what are you doing? \nRAIZO Waiting. \nCHECKER For what? \nRAIZO For the wheel to turn. \nAnd he exits. \n4   EXT. ISTANBUL, STREET - DAY                                  4 \nAncient gateway between Asia and Europe. Minarets thrust up from the tangled streets into the bright Aegean sky. \nThe street is crowded with bicycles, cars and motorcycles as Raizo makes his way down a narrow sidewalk. \nOZUNU (V.O.) Wherever you are, wherever you may go.... \n5   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHT               5 \nWe're in a heavily shadowed room, lit with flickering candles as an older man, OZUNU -- hard-edged and unforgiving -- talks to his clan. \nOZUNU ...you must never, ever forget who you are, how you came to be. You are Ozunu. You are a part of me as I am a part of you. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   8. 5    CONTINUED:                                                     5 \nBeside him is a ten-year-old boy.       His expression has the weight of stone. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) This is the truth of your lives and it will remain true after death. \nHe pushes the boy forward. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) This is my new son. I have given him the name Raizo. Welcome him as your brother. \nThe clan mummers \"welcome Raizo\", bowing their heads. \nOne head remains upright, looking him in the eye.        A girl roughly his own age. Her name is Kiriko. \n5A   INT.

ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY         17 \nSeveral of the younger members of the clan are sitting at the table, about to eat. \nOzunu stands before them. He removes a small blade from inside his robe. Places the blade against his palm. \nOZUNU Hunger and thirst, your bowels and                   * breath, even the blood in your                       * veins, are the body's weaknesses.                    * \nThe knife slices down along his palm, opening a split; the flesh parts, yet no blood flows. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Master them, and you master the self. \nHe closes his fist. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) This is the power of the Ozunu clan. \nHe concentrates, squeezing his hand tightly until he opens it revealing that the wound has closed. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) This is the way of the ninja. \nThe children look at each other, except for Raizo who stares at Ozunu. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Eat tonight and you work twice as                    * hard tomorrow. \nOzunu leaves. \nThe children look at the soup, their mouths watering. All around, the older Ozunu clan members eat noisily. One of the children can't resist any longer and begins scooping up the noodles. In short order, others do the same. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   18. 17    CONTINUED:                                                  17 \nAll except for Raizo, who sets down his chopsticks.

We cannot tell if he is going to eat or not. \nOZUNU The world feeds on the weak. \n18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18 FLOOR - NIGHT \nYoung Raizo stands in the central chamber of the compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not, however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong move will make them shift noisily. \nThis is our first look at the Nightingale Floor. \nOZUNU Suffering exists only because                       * weakness exists. \nOzunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any dancer. \nHe makes no sound. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) You must hate all weakness. Hate                    * it in others, but most of hate it                   * in yourself. \nHe takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a falling feather. \nHe is a third of the way across the floor - his body gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him. \nRaizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches. \nOzunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing blows that leave deep cuts. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   18A. 18   CONTINUED:                                              18 \nRaizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise, and leaving no trace of his passage... \n...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints. \n19   FLASHBACK - INT.

ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                   22Aa \nCLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the light. \nAs we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep, but this is really the first time we have heard him sound like he is straining. \nAs we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this: he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and over, with little apparent effort. \nThe hard edges and lines of his body catch the light, like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR: \nOZUNU (V.O.) Strength is the only virtue that nature respects. \n22Ab   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE - DAY                        22Ab \nChildren are sharpening their weapons. Ozunu walks above them. \nOZUNU Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to survive. \nYoung Raizo looks up and sees young Kiriko looking at him. She smiles. He looks back to his weapon. \n22B    EXT. ISTANBUL - STREET - DAY                             22B \nRaizo walks down a street where repair work is being done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN on Raizo under that sound. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   22A. \n23   FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY            23 \nKiriko is working in the bonsai garden. Raizo watches her silently for a moment noticing that she is secretly loosening the wires, letting the branches ease back into their natural shape. \nHe whispers. \nRAIZO You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you -- \nKIRIKO Then they catch me. \nRAIZO They'll put you in the box. \nKIRIKO Yes, they will. \nShe finishes releasing the branch. \nKIRIKO (CONT'D) I believe the heart of the tree knows which way it needs to grow. \nRAIZO Trees don't have hearts. \nKIRIKO Everything has a heart. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   23. 23   CONTINUED:                                                    23 \nRAIZO I don't. \nThere's sadness and bitterness in his eyes. He's closing off to the world, becoming what they want. She won't let that happen. \nKIRIKO Really? Let me see. \nHe hesitates, then approaches. Kneels down beside her. She reaches toward him. He flinches...a sword he can handle, but kindness has become something foreign...then allows her to undo the top button of his shirt. She presses her ear to his chest. Listens. \nThen she gently whispers to it. \nKIRIKO (CONT'D) Hello....hello, you in there. \nShe listens again. \nKIRIKO (CONT'D) It's saying hello back. And that it's happy to meet me...but it misses you. \nRaizo smiles despite himself. \nRAIZO Liar. \nKIRIKO Listen to mine, I'm not lying. I'll prove it. \nAgain, he hesitates. Then he leans in, and listens to her heart. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.

Survive                    * the night. \nHe signals to the rest of the clan and they all begin to leave. \nKiriko is the last to turn away. \nTIME CUT: \nLater.    Night. \nRaizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain, his face stained with tears and crusted with snot. \nHe is trying to control his breath, at first without success. Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease. His hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins to relax, opening like a lotus flower. \nTIME CUT: \nDawn breaks over the wall, as Ozunu returns to the dojo to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus, completely calm, the wound already beginning to heal. \nOzunu shows a hint of a smile. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Very good, Raizo.

Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it. \nShe likes this guy. \nMIKA What are we going to do? \nMASLOW Your going to go home.

You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way.

Watching silently. \nHe looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length of his face. Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the building in Dubai. \nWhen he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the rest of the clan as to Raizo. \nOZUNU You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     86. 115   CONTINUED:                                                    115 \nHe looks to the rest, pounding the message home.       The message that says hope and escape are futile. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood. This is the way of the Nine Clans. (beat) This is the way of the Ninja. \nHe looks back at Raizo, approaching slowly.       Taking his time. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) I have waited many years for this moment. I have dreamed it, many times. \nHe hits Raizo.    Hard. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) You will suffer for seven days, one day for each year you defied me. \nHe takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very small piece of Raizo's flesh, from the upper arm. Raizo doesn't cry out. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) For seven days, we will...take...from you, as I have just done. Everyone here will take from you. Piece by piece. You will live through it all, you will feel through it all. You will watch as the birds fight over the pieces. \nHe STRIKES Raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause instant agony. This time Raizo does cry out. \nOZUNU (CONT'D) You will know pain like no other human being has ever known. \nHe twists something in Raizo's belly and violent spasms wrack the young man's body. Blood burbles up through his mouth and flows down his chin. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   87. 115   CONTINUED: (2)                                           115 \nOZUNU (CONT'D) Your death will be remembered for a thousand years as a testament to the will and strength of the Ozunu Clan. \nOne last gouge in Raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder through him. \nConfident, victorious, Ozunu turns and walks a few steps away as -- \n-- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor. \nTakeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing something amidst the bile... \nTAKESHI Father... \nOzunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder.    A single LED light blinking through the gore. \nHe nudges it with his foot...and TIME SLOWS DOWN as he realizes what he's looking at. He slowly raises his eyes \n-- and meets Raizo's gaze as suddenly -- \n-- EXPLOSIONS rock the orphanage's centuries-old gate. \nA reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of blinding lights. \nThe Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights. \nThe ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but the shadows are gone. There's no place for the ninjas to hide anymore. We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead vehicles as -- \n-- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it over Raizo's helpless form. \nMaslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off a long burst. \nTakeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and dodges the others.

They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the run. \nMASLOW No more grenades, not until we get the children out! \nBut some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the flames spreading through the ancient timbers. \nThe carnage continues. \nMaslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for Raizo, pistol in hand. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   91. 117   CONTINUED:                                                   117 \nWaiting for Raizo to tire, waiting for an opening. \n118   EXT.

An attack misses wrapping a beam and Ozunu has his opening- \nHis assault is ferocious. \nWounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out. \nRaizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or deflecting the whirlwind attack until-- \nOne sound cuts through the furious fight. \nSnap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as-- \nThe hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place. \nMIKA Die you fuck! \nShe fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him. \nOZUNU Bitch! \nA scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor. But the distraction gives Raizo his chance. \nThe blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu. \nRage thunders the hall. \nMika gets back up and aims but-- \nOzunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears. \nMIKA Raizo \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   92. 119   CONTINUED:                                                119 \nShe cannot see him. \nOzunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst, his blade shatters through Raizo's chain-- \nHurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his chest. \nRaizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces. \nRAIZO Mika! Run! \nMIKA Where is he?   I can't see him! \nRAIZO Get away! \nOzunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull. \nShe spins around but is too late. \nThe ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as- \nRaizo finds them. \nHe sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls-- \nHis pain a force of nature unleashed. \nThe chain blades crackle in the air- \nDual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which- \nFinally shatters against Raizo's fury. \nAnd with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched rag doll. \nRaizo throws down the blood slick blades and-- \n--hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door. \n120   EXT.

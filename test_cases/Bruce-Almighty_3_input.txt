DEBBIE Yeah, she should marry somebody famous, take the focus off. Grace checks her cell phone screen. DEBBIE We would have heard it ring. GRACE I know. It's just that he usually calls during the day. DEBBIE He just needs to blow off some steam, he'll be fine. GRACE I hope so. I've never seen him                        * that mad. An d I lashed back--                        * DEBBIE Wow, you lashed? You never lash. I'm impressed. GRACE I feel bad for him.   He's wanted anchor for so long. Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt. DEBBIE Well, I've been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years, but it's not going to happen. You know, it's not all about money. The CLERK finishes ringing the last item. CLERK That'll be four hundred and twenty- seven, eighty.- DEBBIE What?! Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred or so Tic-Tac mint containers. DEBBIE Zoe. (to Clerk) (MORE) 
DEBBIE (cont'd) Hang on, I might need you to un- check a few things. The people in line hem and haw, exasperated. GUY IN LINE Come on, lady. DEBBIE (snaps) Hey, everybody back-off i Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion. GRACE Listen, I better get back. I want to be there for him. DEBBIE You're a saint, Grace. GRACE What can I say, I love him. And if I know Bruce, he's out there wandering around with the weight of the world on his shoulders.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence. He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing. A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP. BRUCE And he saw that it was good. He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better. Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up, hanging out in the alley. BRUCE B-e-a-utifull 
EXT. ALLEY 
Bruce approaches the gang. BRUCE Hey guys, remember me? The gang members turn to Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh look, it's the hero. HOOD #2 Hungry for another can of whoop- ass? HOOD #3 Your stereo sounds great in my car, man. He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five. BRUCE Look, I don't want to fight you guys. So as soon as you apologize, I'll be on my way. A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle behind, surrounding Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The day a monkey climbs out of my butt. BRUCE What a coincidence. That's today. The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants. The Big Guy looks at Hood #1. BIG GUY Did that come out of your butt, man? Hood #1 faints from shock. BRUCE Now I'm going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson.

EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY 
Annette (left arm's been amputated and replaced with metal pincers which she hasn't mastered yet) sits at the picnic table with Amber and Loretta.  Throughout the following, Annette struggles to open a beer can which keeps flying out of her pincers.  (Handmade "congratulations" posters cover the lawn and trailer.) 
AMBER I just, I just can't believe it.  I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess! 
LORETTA Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama - look out! 
AMBER I'm gonna be on TV!  Just like Diane Sawyer. 
Annette opens a beer with a new HOOK replacing her hand. 
LORETTA Annette, just use your hand. 
ANNETTE They told me to practice. 
AMBER Okay, ready?  Here's the signal I'm gonna give Ma when I'm on TV. 
Amber MIMES inhaling a cigarette and Annette embraces her. 
ANNETTE My little Carol Burnett. 
EXT. AIR FIELD 
In the middle of a corn field.  The "runaway" is a gravel path cut between rows of corn.  A FOUR-SEATER plane is on the runway, in front of a group of town folk with hand- made "good luck" signs.  Amber (in Minnesota sash and tiara) and the Mayor stand beside the plane.  (NOTE: The plane never moves.)

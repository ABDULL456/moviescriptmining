CAMERA PANS WITH OFFICER KEOGH AS HE WALKS TO PAT, GRABS HIS 
ARM. 
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do? 
PAT I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens. 
TIFFANY It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back. 
OFFICER KEOGH (walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here. 
AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented. 
TIFFANY You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face. 
TIFFANY (CONT'D) There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his. 
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
PAT I'm sorry. 
TIFFANY I took it too far. 
PAT I'm sorry. 
OFFICER KEOGH (pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you? 
TIFFANY No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started. 
OFFICER KEOGH There's a restraining order on this guy. 
TIFFANY I know, I have a stupid sense of humor. 
OFFICER KEOGH That's not a good thing to do. 
TIFFANY Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry. 
OFFICER KEOGH You're Tommy's widow, right? 
TIFFANY Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part. 
OFFICER KEOGH You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? 
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY. 
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) What'd I say? 
PAT She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore. 
EXT. STREET - EVENING 
TIFFANY WALKS - upset, vulnerable. Pat walks behind, CATCHES 
UP TO TIFFANY AND THEY WALK TOGETHER. 
PAT I'm sorry about what I said in the diner. 
TIFFANY I know. I know you didn't mean it. 
PAT I didn't mean it at all. 
TIFFANY I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time. 
PAT All the time. 
TIFFANY I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go. 
PAT Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany. 
TIFFANY 
(WALKING AWAY) I know you do. 
PAT You do? 
TIFFANY 
(DISHEARTENED) Yeah, sure. 
PAT I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter? 
INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/DINING ROOM - DAY 
PAT SR.'S BOOKMAKING MATERIALS SPREAD OUT ON THE DINING 
TABLE. 
RANDY I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer. 
PAT SR. No, no, no. 
DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Dolores, somebody was in my study. Who took one of my envelopes? Somebody took an envelope. 
DOLORES Maybe we should call the FBI. 
PAT SR. Don't make fun. This is serious. What FBI? Come on, let's take a look. I'll show you what this is. I'm gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this. I got this, it all corresponds. 
PAT ENTERS. 
PAT Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a 
PROBLEM 
PAT SR. No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask. 
DOLORES "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!" 
RANDY LAUGHS 
PAT SR. It's not funny, it's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for? 
RANDY Dolores, you are so beautiful! 
PAT SR. 
(TO RANDY) Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop! 
(TO PAT) Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in `em. So show some respect for what I do. 
PAT Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number. 
PAT SR. Thank you. 
PAT But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope. 
PAT SR. You didn't want to wake me? (to Dolores and Randy) He didn't want to wake me. He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding

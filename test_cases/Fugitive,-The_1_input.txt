RESIDENT None. He's off the street. 
CUT TO: 
INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT 
Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both working so intently they never look at each other as they talk... 
KIMBLE (to Anesthesiologist) Okay... I'm clamping. Can he tolerate it? 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST He's a very sick guy. 
KIMBLE Do we have a choice? 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Go for it. 
KIMBLE Marie, give me a clamp... 
MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident assisting. 
KIMBLE (never looking up) Your husband know you're here tonight, Marie?... What about this liver? 
RESIDENT History's sketchy. Could be an alcoholic. 
KIMBLE Who referred him? 
RESIDENT He's on a drug protocol. RDU90. 
Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident over their masks, then back to work. 
KIMBLE The wave of the future... Marie, you told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous of this late night thing we've got going here... This should hold him. Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a biopsy... (to circulating nurse) Send it downstairs and make sure you get Kath her slice. 
SURGEON You staying for the closing, Rich? 
Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown. 
KIMBLE No. I got a date. 
INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT 
Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind him; it is the other Surgeon. 
SURGEON Hey, Richard... 
Kimble turns. 
SURGEON Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. He is on phone, waits for answer. 
KIMBLE Hi. I'm five minutes away... 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading. 
HELEN I'm glad it went well. I'll see you in a minute. 
Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT 
Kimble driving. 
INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet. 
Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close one of the interior closet doors. 
She starts to slide the door closed when - wham! 
A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts... 
... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from the top. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still on. 
INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and calls up the stairs. 
KIMBLE I'm home. Did you hear who won the Bulls game? 
No answer. He steps into the: 
KITCHEN 
The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer, and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two glassesand leaves the kitchen. 
INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT 
Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the gun.

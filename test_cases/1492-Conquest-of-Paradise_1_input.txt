SANCHEZ (V.O.) I am thinking of a man.  A devotee to Your Majesties.  A man extremely motivated... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY 
FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes, canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel. Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the hurricane are still visible... 
People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the Palace. 
INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY 
One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda. 
COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them. 
BOBADILLA Don Alonso de Bobadilla. 
COLUMBUS Yes... I remember... 
BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing the royal seal. 
BOBADILLA My letters of appointment. 
COLUMBUS Appointment to what? 
BOBADILLA Viceroy of the West Indies. 
COLUMBUS Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland. 
BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low blow. 
BOBADILLA Didn't you learn?  The mainland was discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another Italian.  I forgot his name. 
A MAN IN BLACK Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency. 
COLUMBUS pales.  Then... 
COLUMBUS How far from here? 
BOBADILLA I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed. 
COLUMBUS How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would. 
BOBADILLA I am afraid this is not the worst news. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY 
All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish. 
A key turns in the lock. 
The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN. COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light. 
FERNANDO (quietly) Father? 
Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up. 
COLUMBUS Fernando...!  My God...! 
He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO. 
COLUMBUS A man!  Diego, how did this happen? 
DIEGO Santangel is going to see the Queen. We are going to get you out of here. 
COLUMBUS Good!  I have to go back! 
DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus. 
DIEGO Go back? 
There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures... 
COLUMBUS I have to explore the mainland. 
FERNANDO This time with me!

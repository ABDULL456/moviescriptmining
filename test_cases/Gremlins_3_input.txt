BILLY PELTZER a bank teller, writes out a receipt for a customer. 
Billy is 26 years old.

BILLY Next. 
MRS. DEAGLE an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check. 
TRACY ALLEN another teller, works beside Billy. Tracy is pretty. Big brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect figure. 25 years old. Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying to concentrate, to keep her mind on work.. But it's diffi- cult when 
GARY LUCIA the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy. Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark, thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome face. Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle. 
BILLY I can't cash this, M'am. Your last check hasn't cleared. 
MRS. DEAGLE Don't you recognize me? 
BILLY No, M'am. I'm sorry... 
MRS. DEAGLE (loud, so everyone can 
HEAR) My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle! My husband manages the.Sparkle Market! We've been banking here for sixteen years! 
BILLY T at's very nice, M'am. But your c eck hasn't cleared and... 
MRS. DEAGLE That's the problem with this world. It's a mess because of people like 
JI$ 
BILLY It's not my.fault your check didn't clear, M'am, 
MRS. DEAGLE Don't get smart with me, oung man. 
BILLY I wasn't getting smart, I was... 
MRS. DEAGLE (shouting,-looking 
AROUND) Where's the president? I want to see the bank president! Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed. Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers. 
ROLAND FRESCO the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs. beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle. 
ROLAND What seems to be the problem, M'am? 
MRS. DEAGLE My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This young teller is being very rude! I demand that you fire him! 
Roland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland smiles. 
ROLAND 
(COMFORTING) Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this isn't that serious. I'm sure an apology would fix things right up. Wouldn't it? The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy. 
ROLAND Apologize to the woman, Billy. Billy leans to Roland.

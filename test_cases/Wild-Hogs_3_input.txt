CHARLEY And I believe that's his jacket. Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on. 
CHARLEY (CONT'D) And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was traded to Dudley. Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and shakes his head. 
JACK No way. He can have his Sportster back. 
CHARLEY Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack. Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley. The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51 Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare. 
JACK 
(TO DOUG) Hope you're happy. You suburban posers are a disease. You need to learn some damn respect for real bikers. Doug smiles. 
DOUG You still don't get it do you, Jack? 
JACK Get what? 
DOUG We are the real bikers. As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes 
DUDLEY LOOKS as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap. up from the ground. 
DUDLEY Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I guess.

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK. 
CHARLEY Well, I wish you guys would stay longer. 
DOUG Ahh, we should be heading back. I think we've had enough excitement for one trip. Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand. 
EARL You guys were a blessing to this place. I mean... I'm not going to get all emotional like "hamburger head" here always does. Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him in disbelief. 
BUCK What'd you just call me? 
EARL 
(CAUGHT) Um... 
BUCK It's just a little scar! I'm still better looking than you! Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left and falls over. 
BUCK (CONT'D) 
(FROM GROUND) Dammit! Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob. 
DOUG (to Woody and Bob) You guys ready to head back? 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 117. Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head. 
WOODY You know what? I think I'm going to press on. Keep heading West. 
DOUG You are? 
WOODY Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my life again. And I'd like to see what San Francisco's all about. Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go. 
BOB I'm in, too! Let's ride to San-- Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out. 
BOB / DOUG Karen? / Kelly? 
KAREN 
(TO BOB) I told you I was coming, Bob! 
KELLY 
(TO DOUG) Hey, honey. Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her. 
DOUG Hey, baby. What are you doing here? 
KELLY Karen said you guys were in trouble. I kept calling your cell, but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house. Doug shoots Woody a look. 
WOODY

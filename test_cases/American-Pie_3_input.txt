Pure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut eyes. 
A gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
We hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her friend in surprise. 
GIRL #2 Joanie, was that you? 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Finch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's no use.  He's at his limit. 
FINCH Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh! 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet bowl. 
The girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever happened, he opens it. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY 
Finch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes register complete disbelief. 
A SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game.  The team scores -- they're beating Central.  Everyone cheers, except Oz.  We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING. 
EXT. MUSIC HALL (MSU) - DAY 
Establishing.  The campus of Michigan State University. Students pass in front of an older, impressive university building. 
A sign out front reads, "MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL COMPETITION." 
INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY 
Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind the curtain. 
They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might come running in. 
VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER Okay.  Albert, you ready? 
ALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny- looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as plain weird. 
ALBERT No problemo. 
He SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and cheesy.  Heather looks trapped. 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals. Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead. Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball. Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground, as Stifler recovers the ball and scores. 
The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the face-off, and gather around the coach. 
COACH MARSHALL Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.  You all saw what happened to Oz out there.  I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score.  You don't score until you score, period. 
The team is getting into it.  Shouts of "Hell yeah!"  But Oz's got a quizzical look on his face. 
INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY 
Heather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself. 
ALBERT Focus on the music.  Think melody. Let the music be my guide. 
HEATHER That would be a start. 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
Oz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused. 
COACH MARSHALL It all boils down to today.  For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years.  Think of what that means to you.  Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? 
A wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall. 
COACH MARSHALL (cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher! 
Oz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath.

BLACK WIDOW See them. HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard. THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Stark, are you seeing this? 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet? 
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.) Banner? 
TONY Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI 
LEVIATHAN. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch the city falling to ash. 
THOR Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule? 
LOKI (tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

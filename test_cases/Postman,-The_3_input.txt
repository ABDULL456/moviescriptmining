But these people won't be denied.       Finally...

THE POSTMAN His name is, uh... Richard Starkey. From Maine. He has a saying. 'Things are getting better, getting better all the time.' 
There's warm applause at that.    Several people try the expression out on each other. 
MAN #3 He a Democrat or a Republican? 
THE POSTMAN Parties are over with. The individual is what counts. You vote for the best man. 
Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The Postman. Famished, he digs in. 
MAN #4 What about Europe? Any word? 
The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food. 
THE POSTMAN Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years old and she still kicks ass. 
WOMAN #3 Is Nathan Holn still alive? 
THE POSTMAN (smiles at irony) He died. Skin cancer. 
That's sure good news to everyone.       But... 
WOMAN #4 And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them? 
The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important question of all. He doesn't want to lie. 
THE POSTMAN The government's just getting started. You're on your own for at least eighteen months.

MAN #5 What about the Marines Corp? 
A clamor of Holnist questions. 
ELLEN Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat? 
The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door. After a moment, Briscoe leaves. 
36   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER                                   36 
A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls. People watch him eat like it was a religious experience. He pushes back the fifth bowl. 
THE POSTMAN Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't eat anymore. 
He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    The kid's looking up, staring intently at something. 
THE POSTMAN What? 
The boy just stares. 
THE POSTMAN (re:   the cap) This? 
The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head. 
THE POSTMAN Almost fits. 
The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up 1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends, ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him. 
ELLEN That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back.

The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away. 
The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman. 
ABBY Would you like to dance? 
THE POSTMAN I don't know if I can, I think I'm still on duty. 
He laughs.    Abby says nothing. 
THE POSTMAN It's been a long time. 
Abby holds out her hand like a promise. 
ABBY All you got to do is hold on. 
DANCE FLOOR 
Abby and The Postman dance.          She keeps looking him over. 
THE POSTMAN Is something wrong? 
ABBY How tall are you? 
THE POSTMAN About six feet. 
ABBY Are you smart? 
THE POSTMAN Smarter than some I guess.       Why? 
ABBY Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps? 
The Postman smiles.    She's odd, but beautiful. 
THE POSTMAN Never had the bad mumps.

BUDDY Lots of things. Buddy, mostly. 
ROSE (greatly reassured, a real smile now) Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you. (solemnly holds out her hand, they shake) Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere? 
BUDDY Sure. Let me take your suitcase. 
A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes boys and men. 
ROSE You're sweet. 
INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY 
CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris chair in her bedroom study. 
MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room. The CAMERA pulls back to include him. 
BUDDY The new girl is here. 
MOTHER Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her? 
BUDDY She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't. 
Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult. 
MOTHER Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed. 
BUDDY You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed. 
MOTHER All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl? 
BUDDY In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel. 
MOTHER Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM 
A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle, very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than offensive. 
MOTHER Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that. 
WASKI You can stop it right now. 
MOTHER When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful. 
WASKI Oh, Mother, cut it out. 
MOTHER (serenely) There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll. 
DOLL I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran. 
MOTHER Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose? 
Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped. 
ROSE (feebly) Oh, no, ma'am. 
MOTHER Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it. 
Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and very, very gentle and kind. Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word. 
The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips, swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous. Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer, Buddy's father. 
DADDY'S VOICE Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out of the girl going into the fourth dimension like that. 
ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude really is inscrutable. 
MOTHER It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth. 
DADDY (staring fiercely at Rose) Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm. 
Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says. 
DADDY (CONT'D) Well, Rosebud, now you are here, darling, and I swear to God graceful as the capital letter S. You will adorn our house, Rosebud, you will give a glow and a shine to these old walls. If there's one thing I like to have around, it's a frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume Mrs. Hillyer and the children have introduced themselves and made your acquaintance, and so forth and so on? 
Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on him, a half whisper. 
ROSE Yes, sir. 
DADDY All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me? 
ROSE (a half whisper) Yes, sir.

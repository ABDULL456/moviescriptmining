TRUEMAN (cont'd) We're not done here. 
BRENDAN (angry) I was done here three months ago. I told you then I'd give you Jerr and that was that, I'm not your inside line and I'm not your boy. 
TRUEMAN That's not a very helpful- 
BRENDAN (anger builds) You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here? 
TRUEMAN What are you in? 
BRENDAN No. And no more of these informal chats - if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the parent conference. 
TRUEMAN Hold it, I could - hold it - could write you up for talking back to a VP. For looking at me in a threatening way. I'd exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye. You can't pull a play like that unless I need you for something. So do I? 
BRENDAN Maybe. 
TRUEMAN So maybe you're gonna need me too. 
BRENDAN Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back completely for a few weeks. There might be some heat soon. 
TRUEMAN (interested) If it's something I can't cover, I won't go to bat for you. 
BRENDAN If I get caught like that it's curtains anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public. I'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts. 
Trueman bites a thumbnail. 
TRUEMAN Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin you for anything you aren't caught at. I'll ride it a little while, as long as it doesn't get too rough. But if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep will need someone to hand over, police- wise. And I'll have you. There better be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or you're it. 
BRENDAN Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask. 
EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - AFTERNOON 
Gary Trueman throws Brendan out. 
TRUEMAN Get the hell off my campus, punk! Brendan glances around, and limps off. 
EXT. CARROWS PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
No stoners, no Dode. Brendan breathes uneasily. 
EXT. PAYPHONE BY CARROWS - AFTERNOON 
Brendan leans against it. 
THE BRAIN No, Dode's MIA all around. 
BRENDAN I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who knows where. I shook but she's not spilling. 
THE BRAIN No more job offers? So she's got a play. 
BRENDAN And I know enough about Kara to let that worry me. Alright, keep your specs on for him. Any other news? 
THE BRAIN Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking for you. 
BRENDAN (considers this) She did, huh? 
THE BRAIN Fourth period, nearly shook me upside down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me? 
BRENDAN She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me. 
THE BRAIN Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If I had known where you were I might have told her. 
BRENDAN That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode, tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll call you tonight. 
EXT. SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON 
Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black mustang. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked. 
Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head, ready to drop it through the window. 
He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.

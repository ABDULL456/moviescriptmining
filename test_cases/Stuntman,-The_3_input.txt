CAMERON It's a rotten shame about your folks and your naked ass, but dying always scared me a little, okay? 
NINA 
...and you are beginning to scare me. You're talking like a wild man!... 
CAMERON Did you know that Eli almost strangled a man because he stopped the camera when Burt got killed?! 
NINA What is going on in that head of yours?! You take the word of some...malcontent...technician! 
CAMERON ...I saw the bruises! 
NINA ...And I saw Eli that night when he had to tell Burt's brother on the phone...I saw the tears. 
CAMERON She saw the tears! Did you ask him what he was crying about?! 'Cause you can bet your sweet tits, it wasn't over Burt. He was crying over losing his fucking shot! 
To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts repacking. 
NINA Didn't they give I.Q. tests in the army? What did you get...minus twelve? Haven't you figured out yet why he's working himself to death? What his film is all about? He's trying to tell people not to kill each other! 
CAMERON And you know what? You want the shock of your life...? I understand what the son-of-a-bitch is saying, and he may be right...which makes me what? Minus twelve, the dumb schmuck with a gun. That doesn't change the fact that he's crazy. If he had his way, there wouldn't be a soldier left alive by morning. But 
all he's got on hand is me. I don't know if he is doing it consciously, but it's a hell of an idea. If he can really get it on film, a genuine dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before your very eyes, I mean the real McCoy...that's gotta help his picture...Then he's killed two birds with one stone. It's got a nice logic. Trouble is, both birds are me. 
Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron says. 
NINA Stop it...sweetheart...I'd die if anything happened to you. 
The TELEPHONE RINGS. Her head whips to look at it.     It continues ringing, but she doesn't move. 
NINA It's my father...I won't talk to him...You're all driving me crazy...I won't talk to him.! 
Cameron calmly picks up the phone. 
CAMERON Hi...hello? 
NINA (whispering) Tell them I'm not here. Tell them anything. Tell them I'm working. 
CAMERON (glancing at Nina) Okay, Chuck. I'll meet you in an hour. (he hangs up) For me. Amazing how they keep secrets around here. 
He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her. She leans against him, the trembling subsiding. CAMERON What if I told you I wasn't going to do the stunt? 
NINA I'd say fine. 
CAMERON And what if I told you I was gonna get out of here tonight...and that I want you to come with me? 
NINA (upset and confused) But there's just one more day of shooting... 
CAMERON What if I can't wait? 
NINA I...I have two more scenes... 
CAMERON That's a shame. 
NINA ...I could meet you... 
When he doesn't answer, Nina resorts to her last defense, irrational anger. 
NINA (CONT'D) ...Look, don't do the stunt! If you believe Eli's a killer, call the police...Why are you doing this to me? That's all I need right now, with all I've been through!...For you to give me now-or-never ultimatums and tell me my director is insane!... 
By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her. 
169   INT.   GARAGE - LATE NIGHT - LOW ANGLE ON THE BLACK DUESENBERG 
Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim. Chuck and Cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the Sunday Special on a used car lot, Chuck the "hearty" salesman, Cameron the reluctant customer. 
CHUCK Look at this mother...I'll bet these guys could build an Arabian out of a jackass. 
CAMERON Why not?   You built a stunt man out of one. 
CHUCK Stunt man? Three days and you've already grown those big brass balls? Jump up and down and let me hear 'em clang, and then do me a favor and leave 'em home for this gag. (yanks open the door) There's just enough room in that Duesenberg for a normal guy...who thinks! (Cameron slides in) Show me how long you can hold your breath. 
Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch. 
CHUCK Now, look around. Whaddya see?...No roll bar in the roof. That's because the roof caving in really looks gassy on film. You got your protection in the back of the seat...steel sheeting. If the roof goes too far, you get your goddamn head down quick! You listening to me?!...Nod Your head. (slapping Cameron on back) You got good lungs. (buckles Cameron's seatbelt) You got no shoulder harness because it would show on camera. So when you hit the water, you brace yourself against the steering wheel. It's reinforced. You couldn't break it loose with dynamite...you gettin' light-headed yet? 
Cameron shakes his head, "No." 
CHUCK Keep your hands off the doors... You're leaving through the window. You lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure. What are you waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down there holding your hand. (Cameron lowering windows) Slower. When you hit bottom, the windows are open and you're gonna make like a minnow. But first, a little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You reach down under the seat and, what do you know, a respirator...Make like you're reaching for it. There'll be one there tomorrow. 
Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator.

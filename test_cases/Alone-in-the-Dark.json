{"train": "ALONE IN THE DARK \nWritten by \nElan Mastai & Michael Roesch \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nA dense forest on a dark, misty night. \nYOUNG EDWARD CARNBY (age 10), small, thin, and terrified, runs for his life. The forest is pitch black. Young Edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as fast as he can. \nP.O.V. CREATURE: Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him. \nAs Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something bright. Edward runs towards it. \nYoung Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light. \nP.O.V. CREATURE: \nThe light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light. \nEXT. FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT 1A                                                                    1A SUPER: 20 YEARS AGO \nThe beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the dark forest. A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining their flashlights around, searching. \nThe trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The flashlight beams can barely penetrate it. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT                                           2 \nA large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A small, dense forest stretches out behind it. \nThe sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT ORPHANAGE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSeveral patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel driveway. DEPUTIES mill around the front lawn. \nAnother patrol car pulls up. Out of it steps the SHERIFF (late 40s). DEPUTY ADAMS (mid-30s) approaches him. \nSHERIFF What's going on, Adams? \nDEPUTY ADAMS Twenty kids live at this orphanage, Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing. \nSISTER CLARA (mid-40s), an anxious-looking nun, stands on the front porch, wrapped in a shawl. She speaks with two DEPUTIES. The Sheriff walks up and listens in. \nSISTER CLARA After the power went out, I went to check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them. They just disappeared... \nEXT. FOREST - LATER The Deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights. The trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. A thick mist hangs in the trees. \nAs Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright light streaming through the trees up ahead. \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING 3A                                                                   3A Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a clearing in the woods. \nHe sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead. A bright light is posted over the Shed's front entrance. EXT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER                                        4 Deputy Adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the Shed. \nHe sees that the door is open just a crack. On the door is a sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY. \nINT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER Deputy Adams enters the Shed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power cables, and various implements for repairing power lines. \nDeputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight. \nHe approaches a large transformer module that sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity. \nThere's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops. \nHe carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space is too small for a full-size person. \nBut sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie CRACKLES to life. \nDEPUTY ADAMS (ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE) Sheriff! I found one! White, male, about ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He's in a utility shed maybe half a mile from the orphanage. \nCABBIE Get the fuck outta here! \nBeat. \nCABBIE (CONT'D) What does that mean exactly? \nCARNBY I'm an effective solution to unusual problems. \nCarnby turns to look out the back windshield. Pinkerton's taxi is still following from a few cars back. \nCARNBY (CONT'D) Speaking of which, that taxi's been following us since the airport. \nCABBIE No shit? Want me to lose him? \nCARNBY If you can... \nThe Cabbie GUNS the motor and speeds off. \n13CC EXT. CITY STREETS                                            13CC Carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from Pinkerton's taxi. \nAs soon as it's evident that they are on to him, Pinkerton's taxi speeds up to give chase. \nThe two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars, SCREECHING around corners. \nCarnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding collisions with other cars and PEDESTRIANS. \nPinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, SMASHING past other cars, forcing Pedestrians to jump out of the way. \nPinkerton accelerates and tries to force Carnby's taxi off the road. The taxi's GRIND against one another. \nCarnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side street that leads to the Market Street. \nEXT. MARKET STREET 13D                                                                    13D A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS, open shops, and produce stalls. \nCarnby's taxi races down the busy Market Street, followed by Pinkerton. \nThey swerve and SCREECH down the Street, cutting off other cars, and narrowly avoiding Pedestrians. \nBut then Pinkerton's taxi ZOOMS up beside Carnby's taxi and BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal. \nNot stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around sideways. \nPinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass. \nThere's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure, exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce. \nPinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to smash into Carnby's taxi again. \nThe Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie struggles to get loose. \nCABBIE I'm trapped, man! \nCARNBY I'll draw him away... \nAs Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the Van onto the street. \nThis gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating towards him. \nCarnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped Cabbie. \nPinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass. \nCarnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs. \nPinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the street. \nPinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street. \nAt the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and down the street. \nHe spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians. \nPinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force. \nPinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING into him with a tremendous impact. \nBut Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery. \nThe computer runs an analysis of the symbols carved into the artifact. The symbols flash by. The computer BEEPS, ready. It has isolated the origins of the symbols. They are ABKANI. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarnby looks over at a photo tacked to the corkboard next to the work station. The photo is of Carnby and Aline. \nINT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE 26B                                                                    26B The Office is cluttered with books, maps, diagrams, and strange artifacts. Along one wall are several ceiling-high shelving units, each containing rows of drawers. The drawers hold artifacts from the Museum's collection. \nAline inspects the stone tablet. She speaks into a tape recorder, like a coroner recording an autopsy. \nALINE The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world. \nEXT. SHIP DECK 26C                                                                    26C Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the container. The First Mate and Crewman Barnes stand quietly behind them. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a fortune. \nHUDGENS You have no idea... \nChernick pulls out a pistol. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK But I'm looking forward to finding out. \nChernick smacks Hudgens across the face with his pistol. Hudgens gives Chernick a grim look. \nHUDGENS I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary. \nrewman Barnes grabs Hudgens and twists his arms behind his back, incapacitating him. The First Mate pulls out a revolver and points it right at Hudgens' face. \nCaptain Chernick wedges a crowbar into the container's lock. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHUDGENS (CONT'D) You're making a terrible mistake. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there. Barnes... \nCrewman Barnes SMASHES Hudgens' head against the container. Hudgens is dazed from the blow. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK (CONT'D) Throw him in there. \nCrewman Barnes throws the dazed Hudgens into a Storage Room built onto the Deck. He slams the thick metal door closed. The door has a small, glass-covered peephole built into it. \nChernick pries open the lock with the crowbar. Chernick hands the First Mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of the door, wedging it closed. \nINT. SHIP STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Hudgens struggles to his feet. He BANGS on the door, trying to pull it open. \nHUDGENS Captain! Don't open it! \nEXT. SHIP DECK - CONTINUOUS The First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in fasciation as Captain Chernick prepares to open the gold container. C APTAIN CHERNICK Let's see what all the fuss is about... \nHe opens the container. \nWith a deep SIGH, the vacuum of dry air escapes. \nINT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby sits in front of his computer. He scans through screens of information relating to Abkani civilization. \nCarnby suddenly winces in intense pain. He clutches his head, staggering to his feet. He knocks over a desk lamp and a chair as he stumbles back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGrabbing his head and trying to shake off the pain, Carnby collapses unconscious to the floor. He is out cold. \nOn the work station, the lynchpin artifact starts to glow. \nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - AT THAT MOMENT JOHN HOUGHTON (early 30s) lies asleep in his bed next to his wife, LINDA HOUGHTON (early 30s). \nSuddenly, John opens his eyes. \nJohn quietly sits up and gets out of bed. Linda is woken up, but just barely. John walks out of the room. \nLINDA John? \nLinda rolls over and falls back asleep. \nEXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT John exits the house. He walks down the front path and out into the night. \nINT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby lies unconscious on the floor. \nCONTINUED: \nSCENES 41 TO 44 OMITTED \nSCENE 45 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 40 \nINT. SHIP DECK - CONTINUOUS \nHudgens steps out of the Storage Room. He looks around the Deck. Mist blows in off the water. The night is quiet. \nBodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate, Crewman Barnes, the other Crewmen. Their weapons lie next to their slashed, ripped open bodies. \nBullet holes are pocked around the Deck. Streaks of blood are smeared everywhere. Shell casings and corpses are all that remain of the battle. \nTense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the empty gold container. \nHe reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container. \nThe panel opens, revealing a small artifact. The artifact is a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one end. It is covered in Abkani symbols. \nHudgens takes out the artifact. He turns it around in his hand. He looks pleased. \nSCENE 47 OMITTED \nINT. BUREAU 713/HALLWAY - NIGHT Everything in Bureau 713's Headquarters looks sleek and high- tech. There are no windows anywhere. \nCOMMANDER BURKE (late 30s) strides purposefully down the hallway. He is confident to the point of arrogance. \nHis second-in-command, AGENT MILES (mid-30s), driven and efficient, hurries to keep up. \nBURKE his better be good, Miles. \nAGENT MILES Sir, we're getting some strange readings in the control room. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURKE his is Bureau 713. \"Strange\" doesn't even crack my radar. Now what's the situation? \nAGENT MILES Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five... \nBURKE condescending) Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors picking up now? \nBurke and Miles arrive at the Control Room. Burke nods to two BUREAU GUARDS standing at the entrance. \nAGENT MILES We don't know. \nBurke stops and looks at Agent Miles for the first time. \nAGENT MILES (CONT'D) They only go up to 50. \nAgent Miles opens the door to the Control Room. INT. BUREAU 713 HEADQUARTERS/CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the Control Room, the banks of monitors and sensors are all lit up. Streams of data flow across the monitors. \nBurke and Miles stand at the doorway. \nAGENT \"KRASH\" KRASHINSKY (mid-30s), a cool and collected female tech-geek, scans through data on the monitors. She always wears a headset. \nBURKE What are we looking at, Krashinsky? \nKRASH Electromagnetics off the scale, Commander. \nAGENT YONEK, a Control Room techie, adjusts the sensors. \nAGENT YONEK Recalibrating sensors now, sir. \nBurke looks concerned for the first time. \nINT. ORPHANAGE/DEN - NIGHT   - TWENTY YEARS AGO Young Edward (age 10) walks through the Den. The lights are all out. The Den is musty, but clean. \nA sliver of light glows from underneath the doorway to Sister Clara's bedroom. Young Edward KNOCKS softly on the door. \nSister Clara opens the door. She wears her nightgown. \nSISTER CLARA Still having trouble sleeping, Edward? You can't stay up all night, you know. \nYOUNG EDWARD Sister, something's happened. \nSISTER CLARA What is it, Edward? \nYOUNG EDWARD They're not gone anymore. The others are back. \nSCENE 51 AND 52 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 50 INT. ORPHANAGE/CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO Sister Clara throws open the door to one of the children's bedrooms. Ten beds are lined up along the wall. All ten of them have CHILDREN asleep in them. \nOn the work station is a stack of the Orphanage's worn-out old file folders. Each file matches a name on the list. \nThe database finishes processing. It has found a match. A MISSING PERSON REPORT flashes onscreen. It's the final name of the list. Carnby makes a note next to the name. \nCarnby hits PRINT and the report comes out of the printer. He adds it to a small stack of similar reports. \nEach report has a photo of a missing Orphan, both MALE and FEMALE. One of the photos is of John Houghton. \nSixteen are missing. Three are unaccounted for. \nEXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY The outdoor patio of a downtown Restaurant. Carnby sits with a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two. \nAGENT PAUL FISCHER (mid-50s), precise but friendly, approaches the table and sits down across from Carnby. \nFISCHER Why did I agree to this? \nA WAITER walks up. He puts down a plate of pecan pie in front of Fischer. The Waiter smiles and walks away. \nCARNBY I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan. \nFischer gives Carnby a smirk. \nFISCHER You've got a good memory, Carnby. \nFischer takes a bite of the pecan pie. \nFischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table. Carnby opens the file. Inside it are photos and reports on the three remaining Orphans from Carnby's list. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFISCHER (CONT'D) I tracked down the three you asked about. They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and walked out in the middle of the night. \nCARNBY That means all nineteen are missing. \nFISCHER I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby? \nCARNBY That's what I'm trying to find out. \nCarnby gets up to leave. He picks up the file. \nCARNBY (CONT'D) Thanks Fischer. It's good to know I've still got friends at 713. \nSCENE 59 OMITTED \nEXT. MUSEUM - DUSK As the sun sets, the streetlights around the Museum all come on in unison, bathing the area in a warm glow. \nThe lights are all on in the Museum. \nINT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT Aline sits at her desk, notes spread out in front of her. The notes show various Abkani symbols. She writes down comments in the margins. \nThe phone RINGS. Aline answers it. \nALINE Hello? \nHUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) Did a shipment arrive for me today? \nALINE It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) (interrupting) Who told you to do that? That crate was not to be opened. \nALINE I was only going to catalogue it for you. \nHUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) It's not your place to question my instructions, Ms. Cedrac. Leave the tablet alone. I'll catalogue it myself when I get back. \nALINE But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just... \nBut Hudgens has already hung up. Aline looks at the receiver, frustrated. She hangs up the phone. \nShe looks up, tilting her head to hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. \nThe Guard KNOCKS on the open door. \nGUARD There's... somebody here to see you. \nINT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL - DUSK Aline exits quickly out of a service door, looking anxious. The Guard scurries after her. \nCarnby stands in front of the Security Desk. \nINT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL The lights flicker. Large shadows are cast through the area by the remaining, dim lights. \nThe Guard sits at the Security Desk, talking on the phone. The security monitors are all out. G UARD (INTO PHONE) I don't care if nothing's wrong with the grid. Something's definitely wrong with our power. Get someone down here, pronto. \nThe Guard hangs up the phone. \nThere's a WHOOSH of movement behind him. The Guard turns to the sound. Silence. \nHe flicks on his flashlight, shining the beam into the dark corners of the area. Nothing is there. \nSomething CLATTERS in another room. The Guard quickly turns to the sound of the movement. \nINT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 65A                                                                    65A Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way. \nThe overhead lights in the Hallway emit only a low glow, flickering sporadically. \nAline leads the way with a flashlight. They come up to a door to a second Hallway. \nThe hairs on the back of Carnby's neck rise up. He touches the back of his neck, spooked. Aline notices. \nALINE What is it? \nCARNBY Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up. \nAline gets it. \nCarnby pulls out his PARA-METER. It's an old, battered device. The display lights up as Carnby turns it on. The para- meter immediately picks up some readings. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nALINE How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated? \nCARNBY I could ask you the same thing. \nCarnby listens at the door. Carnby nods to Aline as he opens the door. Nothing is there. \n65B                                                                    65B INT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM \nThe Guard enters the Ceramics Room. The overhead lights give off only low glows, flickering sporadically. \nThe display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows. \nThe Guard walks through the room, shining his flashlight around. He can't see anything out of the ordinary. \nA WHOOSH of movement slips past the Guard. He turns quickly. Nothing. \nHe shines his flashlight around, looking for anything out of the ordinary. He stands with his back to a display case. \nFrom out of the shadows behind the display case, a long, segmented tail emerges. \nThe tail is covered in hard, dark scales. At the end of the tail is a sharp spike. \nThe tail suddenly flicks at the Guard, piercing him through the back of the head and out his mouth. The tail's spike glistens with fresh blood. \nThe Guard's flashlight CLATTERS to the floor. The bulb BREAKS. \nThe tail withdraws from the Guard. The Guard's body falls to the ground, dead. \nINT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2 65C                                                                    65C Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby. The Hallway is only faintly lit. \nFrom up ahead, they hear a CLATTERING sound. \nCarnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver. Aline hands him the flashlight without a word. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSCENES 66 TO 68 OMITTED \nINT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out. \nThe lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through the area. \nAline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head, no. \nThe dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground. There seems to be no one else around. \nBut then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH CREATURE emerges out of the shadows. \nThe xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs, with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a segmented, spiked tail poised behind it. \nCarnby reloads his revolver. He has it ready. \nBut then the CRASHING stops. Aline and Carnby listen. Everything is quiet. \nThe sound of HELICOPTERS can be faintly heard in the distance. \nCarnby listens against the door. \nALINE (CONT'D) What do you think? \nCarnby nods to her. Aline unlocks the door. \nINT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2 - CONTINUOUS \nCarnby steps out of the Storage Room, revolver ready. The Hallway is empty. \nAline steps out behind him. She motions to the double-doors at the end of the Hallway. \nALINE Those doors lead to the front entrance. \nCarnby hands Aline the flashlight. He grips his revolver. \nCarnby and Aline move down the Hallway towards the double- doors. As they move, they listen intently. The only thing they can hear is the sound of their FOOTSTEPS. \nSCENES 69D To 69G OMITTED \nSCENE 69H NOW SCENE 69C \nSCENES 70 TO 82 OMITTED \nINT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL Aline and Carnby quietly open the double-doors leading into the Main Hall. \nThe lights are dim. Moonlight streams in through the skylight above them. \nAline shines the flashlight around. She hears a WHOOSH of movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it. \nThe sound of a quickly approaching HELICOPTER can be heard in the distance. \nThe double-doors BURST open as an invisible creature SMASHES through them. \nIt chases after them, knocking everything in its path out of the way \nCarnby and Aline run. \nUp ahead of them, the second invisible creature comes CRASHING through the display cases, heading right for them. \nCarnby and Aline are trapped between the two invisible creatures. They have nowhere to run. \nThe sound of a HELICOPTER rises up overhead. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSuddenly, powerful spotlights switch on, shining bright blue beams through the skylight. Another set of spotlight beams shine through the high windows lining the Main Hall. \nEXT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS \nA sleek black Bureau 713 helicopter hovers over the building. A pair of spotlights shine beams down through the skylight. \nINT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR (male), CHEUNG (female), and MARKO (male) burst through the skylight, rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter. \nThey each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it. \nThe creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter. \nThe Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air. \nAll Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows. \nBut the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents' bullets have found their target. \nAs the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily flashes visible, then invisible again. \nThe two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the shadows. \nThe Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground. \nAs they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The bright blue beams cut through the darkness. \nTheir movements are precise, controlled. They all have their rifles out, scanning the area. \nAgent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures. \nHudgens cranes his neck to see Aline's computer screen. His eyes light up when he sees the scan of the lynchpin artifact. \nHUDGENS (CONT'D) Where did you get that image? \nAline hesitates. Hudgens looks curious, friendly. \nALINE Edward. \nHUDGENS This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity. \nALINE I can do that myself. \nHUDGENS That wasn't a request... \nHudgens stands up to his full height, suddenly menacing. \nHUDGENS (CONT'D) Where is the artifact? \nAGENT CHEUNG (O.S.) Everything okay in here? \nAgent Cheung stands at the door, still wearing her full 713 combat gear. Her visor is up. She casually holds her rifle. \nHUDGENS And you are? \nAGENT CHEUNG Ms. Cedrac's security detail. \nHUDGENS My dear, do you have any idea who I... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAGENT CHEUNG (interrupting) Dr. Lionel Hudgens. Former agent, sci-and- spy division. Currently 713 advisor status. I know exactly who you are. But I'm not your \"dear\" anything. \nHudgens looks back at Aline and smiles warmly. \nHUDGENS I'll just have to hold off my curiosity until morning. \nAline smiles stiffly. Hudgens moves to leave. \nALINE Dr. Hudgens... I forgot to ask. Did you find the Erebus this time? \nHudgens turns back and gives Aline another smile. \nHUDGENS Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It was another wild goosechase. \nHudgens exits quickly. Aline and Agent Cheung watch him go. \nALINE Since when do I have a security detail? \nAGENT CHEUNG Since it seemed like you needed it. \nINT. FISCHER'S LAB - LATER Carnby lies on a bed with his shirt off. Fischer runs the hand-held scanner over Carnby's torso. He looks at the results of Carnby's scan on a monitor. \nA spinal worm is visible around Carnby's spine. But it looks different than the others. It is small and shriveled and seems barely attached to the spine. \nFISCHER There's one inside you too. But the symbiosis is incomplete. \nCARNBY Can you remove it? \nFISCHER I could try. But it might paralyze you. \n104A INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - LATER                            104A Aline sits at her computer, checking out 3-D scans of the four Abkani artifacts. She is running an analysis the symbols carved into each artifact. \nStreams of calculations run across the screen as the computer processes. The computer BEEPS as it comes to a conclusion. The symbols correlate to constellations in the night sky. \nAline hits COPY on her computer and it burns a CD of the information she has processed. \nAline searches through a roll of maps. She pulls out a map of North America and lays it out on a work station. \nAline draws lines across the map, trying to pinpoint a location based on the constellations. She marks the map up with latitude and longitude calculations. \nShe stops. She looks back up at the computer screen. She taps her pen on the map. She looks frustrated. \nALINE What's missing... \nThe computer BEEPS again. The CD copy has been made. \nAline rolls up the map and starts to pack up her belongings. \nSCENES 105 AND 106 OMITTED \nINT. FISCHER'S LAB - LATER Fischer and Carnby stand in front of an open armory cabinet. Sleek 713 assault rifles are lined up on a rack beside them. \nAGENT MILES (CONT'D) Commander Burke wants to see you. \n116A INT. HUDGENS' LABORATORY                                          116A \nHudgens walks through a dank cement room. Various pieces of scientific equipment sit in a corner. Shelves are lined with ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks. \nHudgens stops at a work station and pauses. A look of pain crosses his face. He winces, holding it in. He steadies himself. \nAt the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space. The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold. The cage appears to be empty. \nBut suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens. \nAs it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second. \nHudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial. \nIn the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the electricity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFinally, the creature collapses and fades visible. The creature is unconscious, but still alive. \nHudgens turns the dial back down. \nHudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to the cage. \nHe injects the syringe into the creature's neck, between two of its scales. He withdraws a syringe-full of the creature's black, sticky blood. \nHe goes back to the work station, rolling up the sleeve of his shirt. His arm is pocked with injection marks. \nHudgens ties off his arm, preps a vein, and injects himself with the syringe of creature's blood. He closes his eyes, feeling the substance flow into him. \nSCENE 116B NOW SCENE 119B \nEXT. CARNBY'S BUILDING - DAY Aline walks up to an imposing, slightly decrepit-looking old brick building in a bad area of town. \nShe goes to press the buzzer, but the box is broken, the wires limply hanging out. \nShe KNOCKS on the door. No answer. \nShe stops, annoyed. But then a slight, involuntary smile comes across her face. \nAline fishes in her purse and pulls out a set of keys. She finds the key she's looking for and slips it into the lock on the front door. \nShe pauses for a moment, then turns the key. \nSCENE 118 OMITTED \nINT. CARNBY'S LOFT - CONTINUOUS Aline enters the Loft. She looks around. \nLINE Edward? \nAline closes the door behind her. She takes another few steps into the Loft. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe spots Carnby's discarded trench-coat on the floor. She walks up and picks it up with two fingers. \nALINE (CONT'D) I see nothing's changed... \nAline hangs the coat on a hook. She enters the Loft proper, looking around. \nALINE (CONT'D) Edward? \nAline stops. She sees Carnby lying on his bed, asleep. She smiles. He looks peaceful. \nAline sees the lynchpin artifact sitting in the lab area. She unpacks her bag, taking out three items wrapped in cloth. She places the three items next to the lynchpin artifact. \nShe looks over at Carnby, sleeping in his bed. \nAline kicks off her shoes and walks over to the bed. \nShe climbs onto the bed, careful not to disturb Carnby. He stirs a little, but he doesn't wake up. Aline lies down next to Carnby on the bed. She notices the new scars and bruises along his back. \nAline lays her head on a pillow. Their faces lie close together. She watches Carnby sleep. \nAline leans over and gives Carnby the lightest of kisses. He doesn't wake up. \nALINE (CONT'D) Sweet dreams... \nFischer is PUNCHED in the face, hard. He is stunned. \nFischer is hurled over the couch. He lands heavily on a glass coffee table, SHATTERING the glass tabletop. \nThe impact knocks his revolver out of his hands. \nFischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his attacker. \nIt's Hudgens, standing over him. \nHudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now only semi-conscious. \nHudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled body writhing in his grip. \nHUDGENS If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us. \nHudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back, forcing his mouth open. \nCUT TO: \nWe follow the spinal-worm as it enters Fischer's mouth, slipping down his throat. \nWe continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns of his digestive system and internal organs. \nThe spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides, finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length. \nWe move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal- worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts. We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nFischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer, looking pleased with himself. \n119H INT. FOREST - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO                        119H P.O.V. CREATURE: \nSomething chases Young Edward as he runs for his life through the misty, dark forest. He runs towards a light up ahead. \nSCENE 119I OMITTED \n119J INT. SHED - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO                          119J Young Edward enters the Shed, closing the door behind him. \nThe small Shed is cluttered with equipment for repairing power lines. A large transformer module sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity. \nSomething compels Young Edward to move closer towards the transformer and reach out a trembling hand. He places his hand against the transformer's front grill. \nWith a sudden SNAP and FLASH, electricity courses through Young Edward. Jagged fingers of blue light jolt around him. \nSCENES 120 TO 123 OMITTED \nINT. CARNBY'S LOFT - NIGHT It's night. The Loft is dark. Carnby and Aline are fast asleep on the bed, lying next to one another. \nCarnby wakes up with a start. He tries to get his bearings. Carnby looks surprised to see Aline lying next to him. \nHe quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. He pulls on a fresh shirt. \nCarnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light. He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station. \nCarnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts from the Museum. \nCarnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around. Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact. \nSuddenly, the artifact telescopes out. Instead of one thick ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled on the other, with a common hollow middle. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarnby picks up the large ring artifact. He slots it into place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. Next, Carnby slots in the medium and small rings into place. \nThe four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom. \nINT. CARNBY'S LOFT - LATER \nCarnby cooks omelettes in the Kitchen area of the Loft. The ingredients are spread out on the counter. \nAline wakes up. She sits up in the bed and looks around. \nALINE Something smells amazing. \nAline trots over to the Kitchen area as Carnby serves up the omelettes. Aline gives him a look. \nALINE (CONT'D) I love omelettes. \nCARNBY I know. \nThe Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female Orphans has disappeared. \nAline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the weapons cabinet and loads it. \nALINE That looked like John. \nCARNBY It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well. \nCarnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into the darkness of the Loft. They listen. \nSuddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared. \nCarnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John skitters off into the shadows. \nThe Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her with her teeth. \nCarnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for Aline. \nThe Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male Orphan across the face with the pipe. \nAline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see John rising up behind her, about to strike. C arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead. \nThe Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct, Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him. The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies. \nAline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in the chest. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBut it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The Female Orphan falls back, dead. \nAline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse. \nALINE You had no choice. \nCARNBY Something's controlling them. \nALINE How many are there altogether? \nCARNBY Twenty. Including me. \nThe para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down. \nCarnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with 713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets. \nCarnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air. She checks it like a pro. \nAline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready. \nThere's a moment of quiet. They listen. \nThe lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS. \nSomething SMASHES into the Loft's front door. \nCarnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently. \nThe front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by the invisible creature crashing through it. \nP.O.V. CREATURE: \nThe invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman P.O.V. as it looks across the Loft, searching. It locates Carnby and Aline and heads directly for them. A ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them. \nThe creature SMASHES right through a glass-topped work table, SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nAline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming creature as it lunges towards them. \nCarnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment. Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on. \nThe creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it tumbles to the ground, dead. \nThe creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken furniture and shattered glass is everywhere. \nCarnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the creature's death. The lights stop flickering. \nCARNBY (CONT'D) We'd better get out of here. \nSuddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All the computer monitors also go dark. \nThe last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead. \nAgent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr clearly respects Carnby's abilities. \nThe Loft is still dark. Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no longer registers any creatures. \nAGENT BARR We're clear, sir. \nBurke looks around at the remains of the battle. The Loft is totally trashed. A small fire burns in the Upper Level. \nBURKE Love what you've done with the place, Carnby. \nMiles runs a hand-held scanning device over John's corpse. The scanner BEEPS, indicating the presence of a spinal-worm. \nAGENT MILES Sir, this one's infected too! \nAgent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse. His scanning device BEEPS. She has a spinal-worm too. \nAGENT TURNER Got another one here! \nBurke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby. The red laser- sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest. \nTaking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all train their weapons on Carnby. Several glowing red dots hover on his chest. \nBURKE Drop your weapon and get down on the ground. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nALINE What are you doing? \nBURKE He's been infected with some kind of organism. He could be under its control. \nAline turns to Carnby. \nCARNBY It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me. \nBURKE You'll excuse me if I don't take your word for it. Now drop your weapon. \nCarnby holds his weapon at his side. He doesn't drop it. But he doesn't move either. \nAline steps in between Carnby and the Agents. The red dots are now trained on her chest. \nAGENT TURNER Get out of the way! \nThe Agents try to get a clear shot around Aline. \nALINE He's not one of them. \nURKE If I've got to shoot through you to get to him, I'll do it. \nCarnby looks up at the lights. They are still dark. \nCARNBY Why are the lights still out? \nBarr consults his scanner. It isn't registering anything. \nAGENT BARR Scanner's clear. \nAGENT MILES (INTO COMM-LINK) Krash? \nKRASH (ON THE COMM-LINK) Negative. \n(CONTINUED) \n67A. CONTINUED: (4) \nBURKE Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby? \nAn Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look. \nSomething grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall, and rips out his neck. \nIt's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and clear irises. \nBurke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening. \nCarnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke. Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES. \nCarnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The Orphan was about to pounce on Burke. \nThere's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another. Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life. \nrash swivels in her chair, processing data, making adjustments to sensors, and checking out the information scrolling across the bank of monitors. She wears a head-set. \nKRASH We're practically off the scale, Commander. This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha? \nBURKE (ON THE COMM-LINK) The military? We don't have time to wait for them to mobilize. \nKRASH Is that a negative, Commander? \n134B EXT. MINE                                                     134B \nBurke leads Carnby, Aline, and Miles to the Entrance Hall. \nBURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) No. Initiate Nine-Alpha on my authority. But I won't hold my breath. By the time this clears Defense Council, we'll be dead or drinking... \nINT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT Rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie discarded throughout the Hall. Several shafts have been dug into the mountain. Narrow paths lead up the slope. \nAGENTS scurry around, setting up the defense system. The main position is set up just inside the entrance to the Hall. \nBurke and Miles enter, followed by Aline and Carnby. \nAGENT MILES We've got three perimeters of flash- mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander... \nBURKE I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it before sunrise. \nSeveral raised Platforms stand in the middle of the Hall. \nOn one Platform, Agent Turner helps two AGENTS unload a large gold-plated generator from the back of a Humvee. \nAGENT TURNER Generator will be on-line shortly, sir. \nBurke nods to Turner as he and the others walk by. Carnby and Aline get into step with Burke and Miles. \nALINE It looks like you're going to war. \nBURKE We are. The highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all. \nA Tunnel, carved directly into the rock wall of the Mine, leads off into darkness. Carnby stares down at the Tunnel. \nCARNBY We need to go down there. \nBURKE What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARNBY They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them. \nAgent Miles consults his hand-held para-meter. \nAGENT MILES Something's definitely down there, sir. But there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here. \nMiles looks at Burke expectantly. Carnby and Aline watch him as well. Burke looks conflicted. \nBURKE Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there. \n135A EXT. MINE                                                      135A Batteries of flash-mines (mines that explode with a burst of blinding light) set to electromagnetic sensors are being positioned in wide perimeters around the Entrance Hall. \nAutomatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets are set up at key points around the area. The gatling guns are mounted on swiveling robotic bases, able to automatically turn to face on-coming targets. \nAGENT FEENSTRA (mid-30s) tests the motion sensor on one of the gatling guns with her hand. The gun swivels accurately to match the movement of her hand. \nAgent Feenstra nods to the two AGENTS standing behind the gatling gun. They tinker with its guidance system. \nSCENE 136 OMITTED INT. MINE TUNNEL Carnby and Aline walk carefully down a pitch black tunnel, illuminated only by their lights. \nAlong with them are Commander Burke, and Agents Barr, Cheung and Marko. They each carry assault rifles with lamps mounted on them. Their visors are down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nALINE I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men... \nCARNBY Every culture has a story about the end of the world. \nALINE But not every story starts to come true. \nAgent Barr carries a hand-held para-meter. It's picking up high electromagnetic readings. \nAGENT BARR It's definitely this way, sir. \nThey pass by various pieces of mining equipment, long since discarded. Thick dust and cobwebs hang off the equipment. \nBURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) (CONT'D) Krash? Are you reading me? Miles? \nAGENT MILES (ON THE COMM-LINK) Can't get through to Krash either. Too much interference. \nURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) Use the second perimeter as your firing mark. I'll be there as soon as I find a way out. \nIn the sand near Barr and Cheung, something moves. \n54A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                      154A \nAgent Miles and the other Agents watch the perimeter. \nAGENT MILES Hold your fire until they're at the second perimeter. \nThe flash-mine detonations are now much closer. \nAGENT MILES (CONT'D) Fire! \nThe Agents OPEN FIRE, letting loose a barrage of glowing bullets. Streaks of light fill the night. \n80A. \nEXT. MINE The THUNDERING GUNFIRE of the rotating gatling guns fills the air. Thousands of glowing bullets streak through the night. \nThe hovering helicopters open FIRE with their side-mounted gatling guns. \nThe on-rushing creatures SQUEAL and flash visible as the gatling guns cut into them with waves of glowing bullets. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBut Agent Miles' scanner continues to BEEP frenetically. More and more creatures continue to rush towards them. \nThe automatic, ground-mounted gatling guns start running out of ammunition. The sound of GUNFIRE is replaced by the HIGH- PITCHED WHINE of the turbines rotating without bullets. \nThe helicopters continue to lay down suppressing FIRE, but they are also running out of ammo. \n155A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                       155A \nAgent Miles and the other Agents in the Hall continue to FIRE away into the night. \nHELICOPTER PILOT (ON THE COMM-LINK) Ammo running low! How many of these goddamn things are there? \nAgent Miles' scanner registers that waves of the creatures are still quickly approaching them. \nINT. SAND CHAMBER Cheung tests her injured ankle. She can walk with a limp. \nSomething moves through the sand towards Aline. Carnby looks over at the last moment. \nCARNBY Aline! \nWith a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth. \nAline scrambles back and falls down. Her rifle is out of reach. \nAnother sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for Carnby. But he is quick on the draw. He SHOOTS the sand worm before it can bite him. The bullets BLOW APART the sand worm's head. \nThe sand on the Chamber floor comes alive with movement as sand worms burrow towards them. \nAgents Barr and Cheung OPEN FIRE on the sand worms. Aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand worm. It recoils from the light and HISSES at her. The sand worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor-sharp teeth. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe sand worm tries to dodge the light. It snaps at Aline with its jaws and lunges at her. \nShe grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. The sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen. \nThe sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She strains to hold it away. \nWith the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes. It flops to one side, dead. \nCarnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot. \nA sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot. She SCREAMS. \nBarr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her body seizing up from its poisonous bite. \nCheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels back and her body goes limp. She's dead. \nBurke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms. With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at any movement under the sand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe grenades all EXPLODE. Fischer and Turner are instantly killed. \nThe explosion ignites the generator. It EXPLODES in a crescendo of flame and sparks. \nhe lights go out. There is now no protection from the creatures. \n159A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                       159A The spotlights are extinguished. Agent Miles and the remaining Agents turn on their rifle-mounted lamps. \nMiles' scanner registers dozens of signals approaching. A gent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of glowing bullets at the approaching creatures. \nGUNFIRE rings out all around. Glowing bullets streak through the dark night in all directions. Nearby, an Agent SCREAMS. \nThe 713 defenses have become chaotic, uncontrolled. Glowing bullets fly everywhere. The SQUEALS of injured creatures mingle with the SCREAMS of dying Agents. The constant RATTLE of automatic GUNFIRE fills the night. \nINT. SAND CHAMBER arr and Carnby lay Cheung and Marko's bodies to one side of the Chamber, their faces covered with their vests. \nBurke paces back and forth, screaming into his comm-link. \nBURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) Miles! Re-route those `copters! Pull all agents back into the mine! Set formation in teams of three! Miles! \nBut all that he can hear through the comm-link is GUNFIRE and the occasional SCREAM. \nBURKE (CONT'D) Goddamn it! \nCarnby approaches Burke carefully. Burke looks furious. C CARNBY We'll find a way out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBurke signals to Barr. They sweep through the Sand Chamber, exploring it with their lamps. \nCarnby approaches Aline. She is standing over one of the sand worm corpses. Its head has been blown off, but its torso is intact. Carnby turns the sand worm's body over with his boot. \nCARNBY (CONT'D) It's just like the organism Fischer took out of Pinkerton. \nALINE Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host? \nBurke stops at a dark recess carved into the Sand Chamber. The recess is thick with cobwebs and dust. \nBurke cleans the cobwebs away. He stops, surprised at what he sees in the recess behind the cobwebs. \nBURKE I think you'd better see this. \nINT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL 161   A                                                                161 gents Miles, Agent Feenstra, and two other AGENTS, are barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery. They SHOOT streams of glowing bullets across the dark Entrance Hall. \nSuddenly, an invisible creature grabs the first Agent from behind a rusty piece of machinery. The creature throws the Agent into the air. He lands heavily, stunned. \nBefore the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds. \nrom behind his position, Miles SHOOTS at the creatures with glowing bullets, scattering them. \nThe second Agent stands behind a piece of machinery, tense, rifle ready. She hears a WHOOSH of movement nearby. She turns, but can't see anything. \nShe hears a SHUFFLING sound above her. She looks up. The creature is above her, on top of the machinery. \nThe Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at her, impaling her with its tail-spike. \nAgent Miles and Agent Feenstra SHOOT at the creature with precise BURSTS of glowing bullets. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe creature leaps at them. Miles and Feenstra hold their positions, RIDDLING the creature with glowing bullets. \nA creature leaps out at Feenstra. She hears the WHOOSH of movement at the last moment and swivels, FIRING in the direction of the creature. \nut she's SLAMMED off her feet. Feenstra gets a deep GASH in her thigh from the creature's spiked tail. \nAGENT MILES Feenstra! \nThe creature pounces. But Feenstra is fast enough. She BLOWS AWAY the creature with a BURST of glowing bullets. \nSCENE 116A OMITTED \nINT. SAND CHAMBER Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand in front of the dark recess in the Sand Chamber. The recess is completely sealed up by a solid concrete wall. A line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani. \nALINE The Abkani didn't put this here. \nCONTINUED: \nEach basin has a small metal tag on it. Carnby wipes the layer of dust off one of the metal tags. \nThe tag reads: E. CARNBY. \nCARNBY This is where it happened. \nAline steps up next to Carnby. \nALINE \nWho did this to you? \nBurke and Barr continue to explore the room with their rifle- \nmounted lamps. Barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors. \nAGENT BARR Commander... \nCarnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors. \nNext to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank. \nBarr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand- crank CLANKS into the open position. \nAn old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open, revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is clearly not part of the Lab. \nIt is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door. \nIn the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening. A line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door. One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT. \nALINE Edward, look... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device. It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door. The same DARK SPIRIT pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin. \nCARNBY So it's a key. \nBurke surveys the room with a grim expression. \nBURKE \nI say we got two options. One, we open this door, deal with whatever's on the other side. ALINE The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea. \nBURKE Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place.

Aline backs away from the doorway. \nAline OPENS FIRE with an assault rifle. The glowing bullets streak into the dark Cave, hitting several of the approaching creatures. But there are too many of them. They keep coming. \nThe hangar doors are almost closed. The xenomorphs are only a few feet from the doorway. \nThe hangar doors SLAM closed just in time. \nA heavy impact THUMPS against the other side of the hangar doors. Then another. The xenomorphs are trying to get though. \nBurke is positioning C-4 charges around the Lab. He wires them all through a remote detonator. \nLINE These doors won't hold them for long \nBURKE Once we get out, we can remote detonate. \nCarnby approaches the sliding metal door at the side of the Lab. The dust around the door has been swept back. \nCARNBY Look at the dust on the floor. This is where Hudgens got in. \nCarnby engages the opening mechanism and the door slides open, revealing a dark Tunnel leading away from it. \nBurke makes sure the remote detonator signal is active.

Carnby dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it. \nCarnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns to face Pinkerton, gun ready. \nBut Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby, hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a conveyer belt. \nPinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick, Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him. \nPinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is immediately killed. \nCarnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces. \nBut the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving. \nThe artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom, its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols.

What museum was it transferred from? \nThe Delivery Guy reads the information on his clipboard. \nDELIVERY GUY For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens. \nALINE It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show. \nDELIVERY GUY Abkani? What the hell's Abkani? \nGUARD Ancient Native American civilization. They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared. \nLINE You've been reading up. \nGUARD Not much else to do around here at night. \nAline picks up a crowbar and approaches the crate. \nDELIVERY GUY Says here it's not to be opened by anyone but Dr. Hudgens. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARD This is Aline Cedrac.

Out of the packing foam, Aline lifts up a heavy stone tablet carved with elaborate Abkani symbols. Aline holds it up, fascinated. \nGUARD Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days. \nALINE Off on another archeological goosechase. He thinks he's finally found the Erebus. \nGUARD So he sticks you with the work. At least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend. \nAline pleasant expression suddenly turns awkward. \nLINE I'll be in my office if you need me. \nAline quickly walks off, taking the stone tablet with her. \nDELIVERY GUY What was that all about? \nGUARD Damn it...

And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like you. And if you haven't scared Aline away yet, bring her along. \nThe Loft is a large, incredibly cool-looking space. \nIn one corner is a lab area filled with high-tech scientific equipment. At another work station, dozens of drawings, maps, and photos are spread out next to a flat-screen computer. A few photos are tacked to a corkboard. \nSeveral bookshelves, all crammed with books, line one wall. A old framed photograph sits on a bookshelf, a faded photo of twenty CHILDREN sitting on the front steps of the Orphanage. Sister Clara stands with them. Young Edward sits to one side. \nA weapons cabinet features racks lined with guns and blade weapons. In another corner is a work-out area. \nThe sleek, modern kitchen and living quarters are in another corner.

They are preparing to load it onto the truck on the Dock. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for? \nHUDGENS The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences. \nCaptain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container. He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten scraped off in the transport. \nUnder the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of gold. Chernick look startled. \nCaptain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and looks closely at it. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Is this made of solid gold? \nHUDGENS Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck. \nCaptain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and Crewman Barnes. They both give him a subtle nod. \nINT.

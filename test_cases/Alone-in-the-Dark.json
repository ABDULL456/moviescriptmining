Carnby dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it. \nCarnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns to face Pinkerton, gun ready. \nBut Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby, hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a conveyer belt. \nPinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick, Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him. \nPinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is immediately killed. \nCarnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces. \nBut the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving. \nThe artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom, its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols. This is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the other artifacts together. \nSCENES 14, 15, AND 16 OMITTED \nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY The elegant Museum of Natural History.

What museum was it transferred from? \nThe Delivery Guy reads the information on his clipboard. \nDELIVERY GUY For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens. \nALINE It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show. \nDELIVERY GUY Abkani? What the hell's Abkani? \nGUARD Ancient Native American civilization. They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared. \nLINE You've been reading up. \nGUARD Not much else to do around here at night. \nAline picks up a crowbar and approaches the crate. \nDELIVERY GUY Says here it's not to be opened by anyone but Dr. Hudgens. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARD This is Aline Cedrac.

And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like you. And if you haven't scared Aline away yet, bring her along. \nThe Loft is a large, incredibly cool-looking space. \nIn one corner is a lab area filled with high-tech scientific equipment. At another work station, dozens of drawings, maps, and photos are spread out next to a flat-screen computer. A few photos are tacked to a corkboard. \nSeveral bookshelves, all crammed with books, line one wall. A old framed photograph sits on a bookshelf, a faded photo of twenty CHILDREN sitting on the front steps of the Orphanage. Sister Clara stands with them. Young Edward sits to one side. \nA weapons cabinet features racks lined with guns and blade weapons. In another corner is a work-out area. \nThe sleek, modern kitchen and living quarters are in another corner. The bed is set up against a wall of large windows. \nOutside the windows, the sun is setting. \nApproaching the lab area, Carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact. He turns it around in his fingers, watching the light glint off it. \nEXT. DOCKS - NIGHT The Ship is docked at a mist-enshrouded pier.

The container is secured with a heavy rusted lock. \nTwo large, muscular men, the FIRST MATE and CREWMAN BARNES, check the chains connecting the container to the huge crane on the deck. They are preparing to load it onto the truck on the Dock. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for? \nHUDGENS The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences. \nCaptain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container. He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten scraped off in the transport. \nUnder the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of gold. Chernick look startled. \nCaptain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and looks closely at it. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Is this made of solid gold? \nHUDGENS Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck. \nCaptain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and Crewman Barnes. They both give him a subtle nod. \nINT.

He brings up a series of anatomical schematics of the xenomorph creatures. \nFISCHER Two years ago. They've been 713's top priority ever since. But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented. \nCARNBY Have you isolated any weaknesses? \nFischer brings up an image of the periodic table. \nFISCHER Most metals pass right through them. So normal bullets and blades are useless. But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold.

It is a sleek, updated version of Carnby's para-meter, similar to the Agents' rifle-mounted scanners. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) This is calibrated to track their disruption field. It won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby. \nFischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures' disruption field, displaying how it works. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) They live almost exclusively in darkness.

He discharges a bullet. It glows yellow in his hand. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) But for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin.

A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN 
Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular. 
The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. Slowly. 
BEGIN CREDITS. 
Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan Tanka - The Great Mystery. 
And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck. 
Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song. 
And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead. 
LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly. 
LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS 
the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness. 
EXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY 
ROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence. 
Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE. 7:59. 73 degrees. 
The D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the Beltway, leaning on its HORN. 
Good morning. 
And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo. 
CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE 
shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 SX, hard-waxed. 
INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING 
Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go. 
RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty cars and a cement girder. 
EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL 
The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light- industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS CAR ALARM. 
Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a black eel-skin briefcase. 
CARL Hey. 
RAY Hey. Nice tie. 
CARL Don't get too attached. 
They start walking briskly toward the loading dock. 
RAY Ya got the paper? 
They mount steps. 
CARL Yeah. 
RAY You're my hero, Carl. 
CARL Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me. 
RAY Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones. 
They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.

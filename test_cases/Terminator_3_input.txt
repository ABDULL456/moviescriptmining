At that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above.  Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a CHP cruiser coming alongside. 
REESE Just a second.  Keep your head down. 
CUT TO: 
121     EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT                                   121 
The helicopter is right above the, its spotlight burning on Reese.  The cruiser flanks them, closing.  Reese peels off to the right, inches in front of a tractor-trailer rig, brakes hard and slides into a four-wheel drift through a curving off-ramp. The helicopter banks, following. The cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad- side into the guardrail.  Out of action. 
CUT TO: 
122     EXT. OFF RAMP/INTERSECTION - NIGHT                     122 
The sedan roars across the street without slowing and vanishes down a tree-lined side street. 
CUT TO: 
123     EXT. POLICE HELICOPTER - NIGHT                         123 
DOWN ANGLE - AERIAL past the chopper, F.G., as its searchlight sweeps over the close-knit treetops. 
CUT TO: 
124     EXT. SIDE STREET/INTERSECTION - NIGHT                   124 
The sedan skids around a corner, F.G., as the searchlight filters in shafts through the trees further down the street, sweeping futility back and forth. 
CUT TO: 
125     EXT. POLICE HELICOPTER - NIGHT                         125 
It hovers indecisively, then banks off. 
PILOT (V.O.) (filtered) Lost him. 
CUT TO: 
126     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                126 
Reese is ultra-alert, craning to look up, back, forward. 
REESE Good cover. (pause) Alright.  Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit.  Part man, part machine.  Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully  armored. Very tough... 
He pauses as they slide around another corner. 
CUT TO: 
127     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    127 
Reese's sedan glides out onto a main drag, very subdued. He turns the lights on and blends with traffic. The helicopter crosses laterally in the distance. 
CUT TO: 
128     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                128 
REESE (continuing) But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs. 
SARAH Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but... 
REESE (cutting her off) Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. 
SARAH Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet. 
REESE No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years. 
Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool. 
SARAH So, it's from the future, is that right? 
REESE One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff. 
SARAH And you're from the future too? 
REESE Right. 
They come to a red light and Reese stops. 
SARAH (patronizingly) Right... 
Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. 
Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. His grip doesn't slacken. Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction. 
Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The light turns green and Reese drives on. Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth. 
REESE (coldly) Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't...do that...again. 
He wipes his hand on his pants. 
SARAH (weakly, plead- ing) Just let me go. 
REESE (slow, but intense) Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead. 
Sarah slump in utter resignation. 
SARAH (quietly) Can you stop it?

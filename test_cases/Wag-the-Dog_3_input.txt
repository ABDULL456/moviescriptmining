INT STUDIO.  NIGHT.  VAST AMOUNTS OF TAKE-OUT FOOD WRAPPING.  AMES, BREAN, JOHNNY GREEN, MOSS, THE ENGINEER, SITTING AT THE CONSOLE.  IN THE STUDIO, AN OLD, BLACK SINGER, ARRANGING MUSIC ON THE STAND IN FRONT OF HIM.  HE HOLDS A VERY BATTERED OLD GUITAR. 
JOHNNY GREEN, STILL SCRIBBLING ON MUSIC PAPER, GOES INTO THE STUDIO, AND HANDS A SHEET TO THE SINGER, AND LEAVES. 
THE SINGER IS THE OLD MAN WE SAW SWEEPING UP. 
SINGER (SINGS) Good Old Shoe Good Old Shoe...never left you hangin, Just a Good Old Shoe... (HE STOPS, TALKS TO THE CONTROL ROOM) I'm sorry, Barry, the action on this... where the hell did you get this old thing? 
ENGINEER (TALKING THROUGH THE P.A.) ...found it in a pawnshop.  Three bucks. 
THE SINGER SMILES, SHAKES HIS HEAD, STARTS TO TUNE A STRING. 
MOSS Don't tune it too good. 
ENGINEER Leave it flat, will you, Ben? 
THE SINGER NODS.

ENGINEER Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit. (TO THE GROUP) This may take a while. 
BREAN (TO JOHNNY, AND MOSS) This is fantastic. 
JOHNNY GREEN Y'like it?  Wait'll you get to the bridge... 
BREAN This's Fantastic... 
JOHNNY GREEN (TO ENGINEER) Don't go with the bridge from nine, go with the bridge from eight.

MOSS (NODS, POINTS TO THE GLOSSY PHOTO) ...we put your Guy in a sweater... 
BREAN Yeah...? 
MOSS "Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater. 
WE HEAR A WHISTLE.  HEADS TURN.  THE COWBOY TYPE IS WHISTLING.  HE IS OVER AT A COFFEE AREA, LOOKING AT A SMALL TELEVISION, THE GROUP MOVES TO THE TV. ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE A TALKING HEAD, ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRESS. IN THE B.G. AIRFORCE ONE IS ROLLING TO A STOP.  WE SEE THE RAMP COME DOWN AND THE PRESIDENT COME OUT IN THE RAIN AND HURRY TOWARD A WAITING HELICOPTER. 
HE SEES SOMETHING OFF TO THE SIDE AND STOPS, HIS AIDES TRY TO DISSUADE HIM, BUT HE PULLS AWAY.  THE NEWS CAMERA HUNTS AND FINDS A SMALL ALBANIAN GIRL, CARRYING A SHEAF OF WHEAT IN HER HANDS, AN OLD WOMAN BEHIND HER, BOTH STANDING IN THE RAIN.  THE PRESIDENT ADVANCES, AND MOVES TO LET HIS AIDES LET THE CHILD COME FORWARD.  WE SEE THE PRESIDENT, MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE GIRL, OFFERING HIM THE SHEAF OF WHEAT, WE HEAR A REPORTER, V.O. 
REPORTER (VO) ...trying too... it seems that she is speaking in... is is Albanian ... Is it Albanian?  Can we get someone on... 
A WOMAN'S VOICE COMES ON, A TRANSLATOR. 
TRANSLATOR (VO) ...salvation of our Country.  To...to "intercede" where violent men would work to destroy ... to destroy Harmony.  Now is the Harvest Season in my Land, and I bring you... (SHE HANDS HIM THE WHEAT) I bring you this traditional Albanian, forgive me not to speak English, but my Grandmother... 
THE CAMERA MOVES ONTO THE GRANDMOTHER, STANDING, NODDING, BEHIND THE LITTLE GIRL, AND THE PRESIDENT, REALIZING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE OLD WOMAN IS STANDING IN THE RAIN, MOVES TO HER, REMOVES HIS SUITCOAT, AND PLACES IT OVER HER HEAD.  SHE CLASPS HIM TO HER BOSOM.  SHE SPEAKS TO HIM IN ALBANIAN. 
TRANSLATOR God bless you, God bless you, you are my Son... you are a Bringer of Peace... 
WE HEAR A PHONE RING. 
ANGLE WIDER, ON THE GROUP AT THE TV, ALL SHAKING THEIR HEADS SADLY.  AN AIDE HANDS THE PHONE TO MOSS, WHO GIVES IT TO BREAN.

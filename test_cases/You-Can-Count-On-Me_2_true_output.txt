RUDY What time is it now? 
TERRY Two-thirty. 
Silence. The birds sing. 
RUDY Was my father a good fisherman? 
TERRY Yeah, your father was good at all that stuff. He knew everything about the woods, everything about fishing, everything about hunting and everything about cars. If he wasn't such a pain in the ass he would've been a lot of fun to be around. 
RUDY Maybe he's nicer now. 
TERRY I doubt it. 
RUDY Well, I think he is. 
TERRY How would you know? Did you ever meet him? 
RUDY No. 
TERRY Were you ever curious to meet him? 
RUDY I guess so. 
TERRY Well, he doesn't live very far from here. 
RUDY I thought he lived in Alaska. 
TERRY No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad lives in Auburn. Far as I know. (Pause) We could look him up in the phone book. Wanna try? 
RUDY All right. 
TERRY OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have to say this, but I'm not kidding, man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother. 
INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. DAY 
BOB is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous. Sammy sits on his sofa. 
BOB Do you want to go for a walk, or a drive? It's really nice out. 
SAMMY No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I don't want to get married. 
Pause. 
BOB OK. 
SAMMY I've really thought about it a lot, and if you had asked me last year I'm sure I would have said yes. 
BOB Oh. Thank you. 
SAMMY But I'm not sure it would have been a good idea then either. I'm going through a really hard time right now and I just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self-destructive thing I could possibly do. 
BOB OK. 
SAMMY And I really think you have to grow up. 
BOB Well, how about we fix up my personality some other time? 
SAMMY OK. (Pause) I really hope we can still be friends. 
BOB (Quietly sarcastic) Oh, yes, me too. 
She looks at him miserably. 
SAMMY Bob... This is so crazy... I mean... I don't even understand why you... I don't even get it. 
BOB What do you want me to say? Everything you said about me was true, Sammy. I was just a big chickenshit jerk, and now I'm payin' the price. 
SAMMY Bob...! 
She goes over to him. He gets up. 
BOB What?

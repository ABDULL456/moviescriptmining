As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised, he goes over to Alvin. 
DARNELL Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar bill. 
ALVIN Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred once you're startin', depending on how you play. 
DARNELL But we're not supposed to get any are we? 
ALVIN Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a month scholarship money. And the NC double assholes won't let us have jobs, so you take your money where you can get it. (taking Darnell's envelope) I'll keep it for you, till you see the light. Shit, they oughta be payin' us anyway. Athletic Department gets 3 million just for goin' to a bowl game. 
INT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING 
Joe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face. 
REPORTER (V.O.) This performance today -- two touchdown passes, another you ran in. Where do you think this puts you in the Heisman race? 
Joe hates this question. We go to the screen. 
JOE (uncomfortable) I really have no idea. That's up to you guys. 
ANGLE ON SCREEN 
The image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio. 
BERMAN Now let's turn to our Heisman watch. (does the pose while remaining seated) We begin with Sports Illustrated cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led his team to an impressive victory this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues to raise Kane, he may well be Able to dust off a large space on his trophy shelf. Although the real test will come in four weeks against Michigan and their Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen. 
EXT. CAMPUS - EVENING 
Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm. 
BERMAN (V.O.) Michigan also won big today. Timothy, "He Could Go All The Way Men", will be looking to do so against the Timberwolves. And of course the able Kane will be looking to also. I can't wait. 
INT. CAMILLE'S DORM - NIGHT 
Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer. Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away. 
INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT 
The post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players, their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking, celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching the action. 
BUD LITE I don't know, I never seem to make out at things like this. 
Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne. 
BOBBY You don't make out anywhere. Or did you finally break the snatch barrier this summer? 
BUD LITE Fuck you, Bobby. (realizing Louanne's there) Excuse me, Louanne. 
ANGLE ON DARNELL 
sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices. 
ALVIN Forget it, nigger. No chance for you there. 
DARNELL Why not? 
ALVIN Griffin's goin' to medical school. She likes that light-skinned respectable shit. You're just her ghetto toy. 
Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays. 
DARNELL (to Autumn) Can I have this one? 
RAY I don't think so. 
DARNELL What are you so worried about? You haven't lost your starting job yet. 
Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand. 
AUTUMN (turning to Ray) Just one. 
Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance. Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're just having a nice little chat. 
AUTUMN (whispering) Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a good time to push things. You're putting me in an awkward position. 
DARNELL Yeh, well, I got a little encouragement along the way.

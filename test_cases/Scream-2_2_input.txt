Scream 2 Screenplay by         Kevin Williamson 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 
An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front reads: 
"SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT 'STAB' Rated R" 
A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS - mostly college age. 
CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart. 
MAUREEN I hate scary movies. 
PHIL It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. 
MAUREEN If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. 
PHIL We got free tickets. 
He pulls her close, snuggling with her. 
EXT. BOX OFFICE 
Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their tickets. 
They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation of a most familiar one. Phil takes one. 
MAUREEN What's that? 
USHER The studio sent them. 
INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER 
The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS. Everyone is having fun. 
Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in terror. A very lively crowd. 
ON SCREEN 
Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo appears followed by... 
"A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM" 
IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil has slipped it on. 
MAUREEN I don't think so. 
Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him. 
MAUREEN Take it off. 
PHIL But... 
MAUREEN Now. 
He obliges. 
ON SCREEN 
More credits. 
"BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE WEATHERS" 
Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre. The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked. 
ON SCREEN 
The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere. Lights burn from within. 
Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the curtain. It's all very PSYCHO. 
MAUREEN Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? 
PHIL Sssshhh. 
ON SCREEN 
The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone. 
GIRL Hello?

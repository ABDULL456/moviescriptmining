REAL HARVEY (V.O.) That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations. We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.  What can I say, it was the 80's man.

MTV PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT 
TOBY, dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck, stands in front of a White Castle. He delivers his lines in his trademark robotic style. There's an MTV logo on the bottom of the screen. 
TOBY Hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs. Say no to drugs. Say yes to White Castle!

INT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY and JOYCE eat breakfast together. Harvey reads a Katherine Mansfield book as JOYCE reads a newspaper. 
JOYCE (looking up from the paper) Harvey, I've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones... Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians... These kids are amazing and they're -- 
A YUPPIE in a jogging suit walks up to Harvey, interrupting Joyce in mid-sentence. 
YUPPIE Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right? 
HARVEY (smiling) Yeah, that's me. 
YUPPIE That's so excellent. You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot. 
Harvey's not smiling anymore. This guy's a jerk. 
HARVEY Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man. That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway. 
YUPPIE Right, sure. Later, Harvey Pekar! 
The Yuppie rushes out. 
HARVEY Asshole. 
JOYCE Anyway, I want to do a political comic book about these kids. There's a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and I can start by doing interviews there. 
HARVEY Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show. 
JOYCE Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters. 
Joyce hits a nerve. 
HARVEY (furious) Hey! You know I only go on the show for the extra bread! 
People start to look over. 
JOYCE Harvey... you're yelling... 
HARVEY Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?! 
Joyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer. She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt. 
He sighs, calming down. He looks around sheepishly. 
HARVEY I'm sorry, baby. I -- I'm sorry... 
He grabs her hand.

EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY 
Harvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands. They move towards a waiting cab. Harvey carries his wife's bags. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) I guess it was good ta finally see Joyce excited about somethin' of her own. Sure I was happy for her. But I was still upset for me. 
They stop by the cab. 
HARVEY This is crazy. Can't ya just do somethin' here in Cleveland?

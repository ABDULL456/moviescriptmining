SHERIFF There's an ordinance against that too. 
WILLIE (his face grim) Pass 'em out, Tom. 
The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform. 
WILLIE Let him alone! 
The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform snapping a picture. 
SHERIFF (to deputy) Get that camera! Willie, you're under arrest. 
He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat off his neck and goes back into the poolroom. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day 
Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are playing pool as Jack enters. 
JACK Where can I find Tiny Duffy? 
PILLSBURY Right over there, mister. 
He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him there, gather around him to listen. 
JACK Uh, they told me I could get my camera back here. 
DUFFY Who told you that? 
JACK People. Can I? 
DUFFY You the reporter that's been snoopin' around town? 
JACK Are you Tiny Duffy? 
DUFFY What paper? 
JACK Chronicle. 
DUFFY You sure come a long way to stick your nose into other people's business. 
JACK That's true... Only my boss on the paper can't see it that way. 
DUFFY It ain't any of his business either. 
JACK Whose business is it? 
PILLSBURY Them as is tendin' to it. County commissioners that the voters of Kanoma County elected to tend to their business and not take no buttin' in from nobody. 
JACK You a commissioner? 
PILLSBURY Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph Pillsbury. 
2ND COMMISSIONER Me too. I'm a commissioner too. 
JACK Who isn't a commissioner? 
DUFFY He's the head man. 
JACK (to Pillsbury) Then you're in a position to know where -- 
DUFFY He's in a position to know nothin'. And to say nothin'. 
JACK I thought you said he was head man? 
DUFFY (smiling) He uses my head. 
PILLSBURY (laughing loudly) Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now, who thought up those city ordinances about arresting someone for making a speech? 
DUFFY Who's arrested? Nobody's been arrested. (looks toward the door) Hi, Willie. 
Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy. The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's apron, step aside to let him pass through. 
PILLSBURY Hi, Willie. 
DUFFY (to Sheriff) Did you apologize to Willie? 
SHERIFF (mumbles) Yeah, I apologized to Willie. 
DUFFY Did you give him his handbills back? 
SHERIFF Yeah, I gave 'em back. 
DUFFY Give him back his flag and his bag and... (points to Jack) give this man his camera.

TED Look, Billy, I told you before, one hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule... No... (clearly, Billy is giving him an argument) I don't care what the other mothers do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm in a meeting... (firm) Billy, I'll talk to you later, good- bye. 
Note: During the phone call, the CAMERA PANS AWAY to Murray & O'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority on their faces. 
Ted hangs up the phone and turns back around. 
MURRAY (smooth) Ted, I appreciate what you're saying, but I really think you're just too close to it right now. 
O'CONNOR (quickly) Murray's right. (reassuring) Look it's just some ideas, okay? I mean nothing's locked in cement. I promise you this is your show... 
ON TED 
Not very reassured. 
O'CONNOR Trust me on this one, Ted... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT 
Ted is sitting at the dining room table, working. Spread out all across the table are layouts, rate sheets, etc., etc. Billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt-tipped pens. HOLD FOR A BEAT, then: 
BILLY (worried about something) Mom, I mean dad... 
TED (busy) In a minute... 
beat of silence then: 
BILLY What do you do when an elephant sits on your fence? 
Silence. 
BILLY You get a new fence. 
TED (he hasn't heard a word) C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for God's sake... 
Another beat of silence, then Billy reaches for his glass of Hawaiian Punch and accidentally tips it over, spilling purple liquid across all of Ted's papers. 
Instantly, Ted is on his feet, yelling. 
TED Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're doing! 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
BILLY (quiet) I'm sorry. 
TED Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and  
BILLY I'm sorry. 
TED (sardonic) That's terrific. That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this  (noticing an important paper covered with grape juice) Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over. 
BILLY (starting to help) I'm sorry. 
By now there is nothing the boy can do right. 
TED Look, it's after your bedtime, okay? Just do me a favor and go to bed, okay? 
Billy gets to his feet, collects his stuff and walks into his bedroom. HOLD ON TED who sits for a moment, then gets wearily to his feet and as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM crosses to the door of Billy's room. He stops in the doorway, looks OFF SCREEN. 
HIS POV 
Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
TED Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay? 
BILLY (quiet) That's okay. 
TED It's just... I've been catching a lot of flack at the office... 
BILLY That's okay... 
INT. OFFICE  DAY 
ON THE DOOR TO O'CONNOR'S OFFICE 
As it opens and Phyllis comes out. In the background in O'Connor's office we SEE O'Connor and Murray, talking, laughing. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE Phyllis as she walks to Ted Kramer's office and opens the door without knocking. 
PHYLLIS How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT, MIDTOWN  DAY 
ON TED AND PHYLLIS 
As they sit across from one another. A waiter stands over them, setting drinks in front of them. 
WAITER Perrier and lime... (placing a drink in front of Phyllis) ...and scotch with soda. (putting Ted's drink in front of him) 
The waiter bustles away. 
TED Okay, Phyllis, what's up? 
PHYLLIS Kramer... 
She breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on. Then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp. 
PHYLLIS (in a rush) O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.

MAN #1 How 'bout homosexuality,                  Tony? You. like men, y'like to dress                  up like a woman? TONY (to Man #2) Never tried it. What the                                                      (X) fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he                  think I am? 
MAN #2 Just       answer     the    questions,     Tony. The      voices        of   the   men       remain   cool    and     collected    throughout.

MAN #1 Arrested?           Vagrancy? Marijuana? 
TONY .             Never.       Nothing. NO        ..NO. i His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors) and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the shadows. 
MAN #3 So       where'd    you     get the     beauty     scar? 
TONY     ?' This?.. (scratching the scar, shrugs) I was a kid. You should                     see   the other kid. (a grim chuckle) 
MAN #3 And      this? He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between                     the thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word "Madre" scaled through it. 
TONY Oh       that     was   for    my sweetheart.

LADY MARY Do not look at me like that! It was my Mamaa who intervened. I thought he had a very great sense of duty. Overly kind at times but... LADY MANSFIELD watches as though she knows the rest. 
DIDO (gently) But...what, Aunt Mary? 
LADY MARY hesitates and LADY MANSFIELD cuts in, saving her. LADY MANSFIELD HE is engaged, you know? DIDO follows her gaze to JOHN, as he climbs from the horse, hands it to a STABLEMAN. 
LADY MARY Engaged! ELIZABETH Is he? LADY MANSFIELD Mr Beresford's daughter. 
ELIZABETH The carriage-maker! He might have set his sights a little higher! AS JOHN marches toward the back entrance of the house. He nods to the ladies. A self-conscious beat between he and DIDO, her back to him - as he disappears inside. 
OFF her reaction. 
35   INT. KENWOOD STUDIO. DAY. 7                                 35    * 
CLOSE ON: the soft curls around DIDO'S hairline, a single eye, her nose, cheek. HOLD on her lips. 
ON the painter's canvas...a sketch emerging - he brings DIDO'S mouth to life. We see an outline of ELIZABETH with some detail, already been created. REVEAL ELIZABETH beside DIDO. As her hand slides over to DIDO'S and she squeezes it tight. ON their clasped hands. 
ZOFFANY To the window, Miss Lindsay DIDO favours the window a little more...Soft sunlight pours onto her skin. 
36   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 7                36    * 
JOHN moves through corridors - hat under his arm. ELIZABETH emerges from the studio, drawing his attention to... Through a half open doorway, his POV: DIDO sits on stool before ZOFFANY. The sight draws JOHN to a halt. He attempts to move off - but cant! He observes DIDO quietly. She is somehow tranquil under Zoffany's gaze. 
A beat before her eyes fall on JOHN'S outline in the doorway - his stare, penetrating and compelling. ON ZOFFANY - he follows DIDO'S gaze to JOHN. Then he sketches madly, filling in DIDO'S eyes in great detail. ON JOHN, embarrassed - he moves away quickly.   DIDO is affected. She jumps up! Goes after him! 
As ELIZABETH'S eyes follow, uncertain. DIDO Wait... She is upon him in the CORRIDOR! They stand silent, awkward. 
JOHN I...I was curious... DIDO Quite a task - to sit for so many                       * hours...(beat)... Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday.                            * JOHN Thank you. He falters slightly, swallows hard - not all is well. 
Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm. JOHN shifts uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG can be seen, and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt. DIDO I appear the only one to have just learned of this affair? 
JOHN Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters. DIDO Why do you judge me so? He studies her. She is tentative. 
DIDO (CONT'D) It is a fact that I have contemplated on the matter for many hours, and I...I do not think the slaves could have been drowned in the way you say. 
ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning. 
JOHN Are you at utter disconnect from everything?! He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As he moves off, she stares after him, distressed. 
DIDO Mr Davinier...please. Tell me. Tell me what you know! 
He stops, stares back at her.   What to do? DIDO (CONT'D) (earnest) Do not render me your amusement. He traces her vulnerability. It roots him.

BRIAN Take it off. 
DAVID I can't. It's a facial shield. It's an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections. These fucking doctors. 
BRIAN (with all love) Take off the mask! It's freaking me out. 
DAVID I can't. It's my face. This is my face. 
BRIAN Oh no. Trust me. It's a little different. 
DAVID Hey, if you're embarrassed, just go. Nobody asked you to chaperone 
BRIAN Sofia asked me. 
DAVID She didn't want to be alone with me? (Brian regrets his words) That's bullshit. Because I think I'm being pretty fucking cool about the whole thing. 
BRIAN Talk to a shrink!        Or you can call me sometime, instead of hiding in your apartment. Don't take it out on a girl you only met once. 
DAVID (stung) Did she say that? I met her "once?" Did she say I met her "once?" Brian looks away. He's said too much. 
BRIAN Cut it out. I miss the old you. We all miss the old you. Because the new guy is shit. David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say. 
BRIAN Oh. Man. Wait. That came out wrong. I love you - period. How's your arm, man? David shakes his head, moves toward the bar. 
DAVID Fuck you, Brian. How about no more sympathy? How about if that's the deal we make with each other? Okay? David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his mask. His head thuds from a migraine. 
DAVID Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of tequila. 
BARMAN (avoiding eye contact) What kind of tequila? 
DAVID What did you say to me? 
BARMAN (leans closer, still looking down) I said - What. Kind. Of. Tequila. 
DAVID Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch? The barman looks up, expressionless. 
DAVID Patron. If you have it. 
ON DAVID - LATER watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as friends. 
DAVID Another shot, another Bud. He throws bills on the bar. 
BARMAN No. This is on the house. 
DAVID Why - 
BARMAN (odd compassion) It just is. Bitch. David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the Barman. 
DAVID Patron! David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good- looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David 
over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds back another drink. 
INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to ward off a headache. 
CLUBGOER # 1 Dude, fix your face!! The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels better.

It is a Xerox of the police notification information of Walter printed from the Internet. 
Walter stares at the paper. Suddenly something slams next to his head. A piece of metal clangs to the floor. Walter turns around. 
edro stares at him, surrounded by a number of men. 
Vicki stands in front of her locker holding the flyer. She looks scared. She glances at the men then walks over to Walter. 
VICKI (quiet) Come on, let's get out of here. 
Walter doesn't move. 
PEDRO Don't tell me you feel sorry for this sick fuck. 
VICKI Mind your own business, Pedro! 
Vicki looks defiantly at the men.

BOB What the hell is going on here?! 
He's handed a flyer. He looks it over and turns red. He looks at Walter then the men. 
OB (cont'd) Who did this? 
Mary-Kay stands quietly in the back of the room, a look of satisfaction on her face. Vicki looks at her. Mary-Kay turns and sees Vicki's glare. She quickly looks away. 
No one answers. Bob looks at the men for a long moment then at Walter. 
BOB (cont'd) Any man who can't deal with it can see me in my office. I'll pay you for a week, and you can clear out. 
Bob crumples the paper in his hand. 
BOB (cont'd) We've got a hell of a lot of orders today. Get to work. 
Bob turns and walks away.

Walter walks off without saying anything, his expression blank.

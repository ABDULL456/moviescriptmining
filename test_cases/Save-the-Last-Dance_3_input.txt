165   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      165 
Sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album. Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition. Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She keeps flipping. 
ROY I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. (this raises a small smile) Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck. 
Sara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser, picks up an envelope from Juilliard. 
ROY I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara. 
SARA (quietly miserable) I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to. 
She's clutching the photo album.    Roy sits down next to her. 
ROY Tomorrow's the big day? 
SARA Uh-huh.   The big day. 
ROY You bummed out about it? (as she shakes her head) You're a worse liar than I am father.

SARA You're not so bad. (close to a confession) I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter. 
ROY Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by. 
Sara's eyes well up.    Before she can stop herself,        she's crying. 
SARA I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... (as Roy takes her in his arms, tries to console her) ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. 
Sara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears.       Collects herself. 
ROY You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to see. 
SARA I wanted somebody there who loves me. 
Roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony implicit.

ROY I love you. 
Sara looks up.    For the first time in her life, she believes him. 
166   INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING         166 
Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her. Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him. They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation. 
MALAKAI Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone? 
Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there. 
PATRICK They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. (trying to be strong; faltering) Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again. 
In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably cry. 
Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body, cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this crooked, derisive way. 
MALAKAI I got a good reason now, man? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
166   CONTINUED:                                                      166 
MALAKAI (CONT'D) (off Patrick's silence) Aw'ight, college boy. You do what you think is the right thing. I'ma do what I know is the only thing. 
He starts to walk off, doesn't get far before Patrick calls out. 
PATRICK Malakai... (a fleeting hesitation) ... When it's on, I'll be there. 
167   EXT. PLAYGROUND (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PARK) - DAY                  167 
Groups of children scatter around worn-out playground equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere. Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine throughout their conversation. 
CHENILLE Why you so quiet? (off Patrick's brooding look) Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. (catches her son with a whee!; then) You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you. 
PATRICK (monotone) I don't care what you said, Chenille. 
CHENILLE Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. (as he looks at her) You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'?

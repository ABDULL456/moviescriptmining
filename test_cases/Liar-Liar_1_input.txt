AUDREY Fletcher?! 
AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN! BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading Â· right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE 
CART. . - And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING! 
Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A 
MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE! 
CLOSE ON FLETCHER 
With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 
Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED. He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES. 
FLETCHER (mumbles to 
HIMSELF) Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes indeed. 
DEPUTY Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a shoe, and still holding the compress. 
FLETCHER 
(WEAKLY) Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY waiting for him just outside the door. Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY. He sees his dad, then quickly turns away. 
FLETCHER (to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper) Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. (no response) You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . . 
AUDREY Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing? 
FLETC HER That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin... 
FLETCHER Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty, 
SINCERELY) I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher said, but the way he said it. 
FLETCHER I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced. 
AUDREY You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight. 
FLETCHER I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry. 
FLETCHER I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again? 
JERRY I design security systems. 
FLETCHER How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec? 
JERRY The biggest. 
FLETCHER One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    .. 
AUDREY Don't put Jerry in the middle. 
JERRY It's okay. (to Fletcher) Boston means this (snaps his 
FINGERS) to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey. 
AUDREY All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset. 
AUDREY You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today. 
FLETCHER Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

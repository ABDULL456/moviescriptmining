COLUMBUS If you can do that, Excellency -- I'll become a monk! 
He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S muffled laughter. 
As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret door.  SANCHEZ bows. 
ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out. 
ISABEL You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. 
SANCHEZ Never, Your Majesty.  Although... 
She turns, questioningly, towards him. 
SANCHEZ ... Although one may always renegotiate a contract.  Especially signed by Royal Hands. 
EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY 
SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS striding out and away. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY 
BACK TO SANCHEZ 
SANCHEZ (quietly) ... Into a monk... 
ISABEL (with a smile) Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it? (turning to Sanchez) Call him back! 
EXT.  STREET - EVENING 
Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds. He is expressionless and distracted. 
He looks around him, stops walking.  And then, unexpectedly, shouts. 
COLUMBUS YEEEEEEES! 
All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on as if nothing happened. 
INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt. 
COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad. 
COLUMBUS She said yes. 
BEATRIX (moved) Thank God... 
She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her happiness. 
COLUMBUS If I ever come back, I swear I will... 
She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his mouth. 
BEATRIX (softly) I'm not asking you to swear to anything. 
COLUMBUS I don't want you to wait for me. 
BEATRIX (smiling) That's something you can't decide. 
COLUMBUS kisses her. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor. 
Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study. 
INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal. 
Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map. 
FERNANDO (O.S.) You can't go there! 
Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him. 
COLUMBUS Why not?

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and closes the lid. 
LULA Dont do this, Sailor, please. 
Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the car. 
SAILOR (to Pace) Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin dont feel right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid... Lets went, before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music. 
Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks down her face. 
ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and down her cheeks as in Sailors dream. 
SAILOR You been doin fine without me, peanut. There aint no need to make life toughern it has to be. 
He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks away.  She lets him go. 
CUT TO: 
160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care. 
CUT TO: 
161. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out the window. 
CUT TO: 
162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around him, coming in closer for the kill. 
SAILOR What do you faggots want? 
Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood begins to pour from his swelling nose. 
162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it. 
In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him. 
GOOD WITCH Sailor Ripley... 
Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids. His mouth speaks through closed lips. 
SAILOR The Good Witch... 
GOOD WITCH Sailor...  Lula loves you. 
SAILOR But Im a robber and a manslaughterer and I havent had any parental guidance. 
GOOD WITCH Shes forgiven you of all these things ...  You love her...  Dont be afraid, Sailor. 
SAILOR But Im wild at heart. 
GOOD WITCH If you are truly wild at heart, youll fight for your dreams...  Dont turn away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn away from love...  Dont turn away from love. 
The Good Witch disappears. 
162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on his feet.  The gang still stands around him. 
GANG MEMBER You had enough, asshole? 
SAILOR Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals.  I also want to thank you fellas, youve taught me a valuable lesson in life. (lifts his head high) LULA!!!! 
Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go. 
CUT TO: 
163. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still crying and horns are honking all around them. 
CUT TO: 
164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING 
Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME. 
He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars. 
He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he jumps on the hood of Lulas car. 
She sees him. 
SAILOR LULA!!!! 
LULA SAILOR!!!!

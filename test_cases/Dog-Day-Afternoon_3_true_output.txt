SONNY Huh... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. 
LEON Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped! 
SONNY I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! 
LEON (stuttering) God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there. 
SONNY What am I supposed to do? 
LEON (bitchy) I don't know... you could have picked a better place. 
SONNY Denmark?  Sweden? 
LEON (pleased) I like that... yeah! 
SONNY Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in? 
Laughter from both Sonny and Leon. 
LEON So!  Sal is with you? 
SONNY Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me. 
LEON Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now. 
SONNY I know I am.  I know! 
LEON (making fun of Sonny) Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy! 
SONNY He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya! 
LEON Would you do something for me? Please? 
SONNY What? 
LEON These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank! 
SONNY How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story. 
LEON Well... they told me that I was an accomplice... 
SONNY Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit! 
LEON I gotta listen to it if they think... 
SONNY Shit... 
LEON I can't survive in prison, Sonny... 
SONNY All right.  Then what do you want me to say? 
LEON Sonny, would you please just tell them... please... 
SONNY Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now? 
LEON (meekly) Yeah. 
SONNY (annoyed) That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me? 
LEON I don't have a choice. 
SONNY You don't have a choice? 
LEON No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me. 
SONNY Look... who's on the phone? 
LEON Look... don't throw that on me. 
SONNY Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right? 
LEON Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here... 
SONNY All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti? (angrily into phone) You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me? 
LEON They won't talk to you. 
SONNY Are they on the phone still? 
LEON Yeah... yeah! 
SONNY (still angry) All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh? (calmly to Leon) Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you? 
LEON Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me. 
SONNY That's good then.  You've found something. 
LEON Well... I don't know if I have or not.

FADE IN: 
FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 
It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. 
PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS 
waiting at street corner for light to change. 
CLOSE SHOT - MAN 
at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the sky. 
TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM 
as she follows his gaze upward. 
LONG SHOT - THE SKY 
with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. 
MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER 
as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES: 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS 
in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters. 
INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT 
Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her. 
MELANIE Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Hello, Miss Daniels. 
MELANIE What do you suppose it is? 
MED. SHOT 
Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s. 
MRS. MACGRUDER (shaking her head) There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know. 
They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk: 
MRS. MACGRUDER I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. (apologetically) You see, he hasn't arrived yet. 
MELANIE You said three o'clock. 
MRS. MACGRUDER I know. Oh, I know. (she is more distressed now) I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to... 
MELANIE Well, this one won't be a chick, will he? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown. 
MELANIE And he'll talk? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk. 
MELANIE Yes. 
MRS. MACGRUDER Yes. (pause) Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. (pause) Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting? 
MELANIE (judiciously) I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. (she begins taking off her gloves) 
MRS. MACGRUDER (producing pencil and pad) Oh. Oh, well, all right. 
As Melanie starts writing: 
MRS. MACGRUDER I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call? 
MELANIE (with a resigned sigh) Well, all right, but... 
She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil. 
MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.) Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's. (pause; accusingly) It's past three, you know. (pause) Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait. 
Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up. 
MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER 
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again. 
MITCH I wonder if you could help me. 
MELANIE What? 
MITCH (deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur) I said I wonder if you could help me. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her. 
MELANIE (solicitously) Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir? 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MITCH (deadpan) Lovebirds. 
MELANIE Lovebirds, sir? 
MITCH Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?

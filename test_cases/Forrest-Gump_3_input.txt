JENNY You can't keep doing this, Forrest. You can't keep tryin' to rescue me all the time. 
FORREST They was tryin' to grab you. 
JENNY A lot of people try to grab me. Just -- you can't keep doing this all the time! 
FORREST I can't help it. I love you. 
JENNY Forrest, you don't know what love is. 
Jenny turns and looks over the bridge. 
JENNY You remember that time we prayed, Forrest? We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away? 
FORREST Yes, I do. 
JENNY You think I can fly off this bridge? 
FORREST What do you mean, Jenny? 
JENNY Nothing. 
Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle. 
She steps into the street. 
JENNY I gotta get outta here. 
Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle. 
FORREST But wait. Jenny! 
JENNY Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please. 
A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver. 
JENNY Can I have a ride? 
DRIVER Where you going? 
JENNY I don't care. 
DRIVER Get in the truck. 
FORREST So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country. 
Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver. 
JENNY Just hang on a minute. 
Jenny walks up to Forrest. 
JENNY Listen, you promise me something, okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave, you just run, okay? Just run away. 
FORREST Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the time. 
Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away. 
FORREST (V.O.) And just like that. 
EXT. GREENBOW/GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/RIVER - DAY 
Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river. 
FORREST (V.O.) ...she was gone. 
Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder. 
MRS. GUMP You come back safe to me, do ya hear? 
EXT. VIETNAM/MEKONG DELTA - MORNING (1967) 
The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter. 
EXT. FIREBASE/4TH PLATOON 
The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase. 
SONG "Some folks are born made to wave the flag. Ooh, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point the cannon at you all. It ain't me. It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..." 
Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/ They walk and look around oddly. 
FORREST (V.O.) Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be very different from the United Sates of America. 
The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases. 
He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer. 
FORREST (V.O.) Except for all the beer cans and the barbecue, it was. 
BUBBA Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in these waters. They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, after we win this war, and we take over everything we can get American shrimpers to come on here and shrimp these waters. We'll just shrimp all the time, man. So much shrimp, why, you wouldn't believe it. 
Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand. 
LT. DAN You must be my F.N.G.'s.

She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to Coraline, pinches her nose. 
CHARLIE Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer. 
Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed. 
CORALINE Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. 
Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel and Coraline drive off. 
INT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME 
PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK. 
Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES. 
As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit. 
YOUNG RASCAL My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!! 
There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls back to Coraline. She gets an idea. 
Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her: 
MEL Put them back. 
CORALINE But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. 
MEL Put them back. 
Coraline mutters: 
CORALINE My other mother would get them. 
MEL Maybe she should buy all your clothes. 
Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves. 
INT. CAR - SAME 
Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back. 
CORALINE So what do you think's in the other apartment? 
MEL I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters. 
CORALINE Then why'd you lock the door? 
MEL (shorter than previous) Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer. 
CORALINE They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. 
MEL Your school might be fun. 
CORALINE With those stupid uniforms?   Right. 
MEL Had to give it a try. 
They pull into their DRIVEWAY. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas from the fridge. 
MEL How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch? 
Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a face. 
CORALINE Are you kidding me? 
MEL Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special. 
Coraline squinches up her nose. 
CORALINE Gross-gusting. 
MEL 
(BRIGHTENS ) You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like. 
Coraline plops down in a chair. 
CORALINE Oh, like the gloves? 
Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl pulls away. 
MEL Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up. 
CORALINE That's what you always say. 
Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door to leave. 
MEL Won't be long. 
Shuts the door.

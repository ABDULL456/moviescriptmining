But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone- liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined. 62   ANGLE - TIRE                                                     62 \nas Sherman approaches.

ROLAND What happened, man? You need some help? SHERMAN No thanks. Hi. No, I don't think so. No. Thank you very much. Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman. Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket. He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes up finally. \nSHERMAN Excuse me.   I have to go.

They both keep moving. \nROLAND Where you going with that tire? \nSHERMAN Oh. Is this yours? Here.    You take it. Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland. Roland pushes it back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down. SHERMAN Oh. Sorry.

ELIOT The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry. (strokes the wood lovingly) Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest adjustable mattress with matching pillow. He gestures to a metal casket. 
ELIOT Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze exterior. Hand brushed finish with Grecian bronze highlights. 
MRS. AYRES The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the Antique Carlisle. 
ELIOT (writes in his notebook) Excellent choice. Mrs. Ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming. 
MRS. AYRES An antique coffin for an antique lady. We suit each other. 
ELIOT 
(SMILES) You'll look beautiful. 
(BEAT) Now about the service.   Would you like a private visitation? Mrs. Ayres is miles away. 
ELIOT Mrs. Ayres? 
MRS. AYRES I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation. 
(HESITATES) Mr. Deane? What happens when we die? 
Eliot chooses his words carefully. 
ELIOT It's different every time.   Each person dies in their own way. 
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNING 
Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space. The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out... ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage. 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Anna locks her car.   Heads towards the main building. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING 
Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy, walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed. 
TALL KID Hey.   Jack-off! Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him. He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them. 
TALL KID (O.C.) Didn't you hear me Jack-off? Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply. 
ACNE KID He must be deaf. 
TALL KID You deaf Jack-off? Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more. 
TALL KID Can't fucking speak either. He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator. Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just then the door opens. Anna walks in. 
ANNA What's going on? She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack. 
ANNA Jack? 
JACK Nothing Miss Bryant. 
ANNA Nothing? The incubator didn't just fall by itself. The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction. 
JACK I tripped.   It was an accident. Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying. 
ANNA (to the Older Boys) Show's over. Get to your classes. 
(TO JACK) Jack. Help me clear up. Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.

JEN But what if we give him a little dose of reality? GARY Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto. BILL You mean, have Brad actually... go there? TOM Exactly. BILL Sounds dangerous... \nBRETT It'll be perfectly safe. BILL How does it work? JEN We hire actors to play gangsters. TOM They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like.      It might just scare the black out     of him.

Young Dre proceeds to incinerate Brad. With every line, the crowd goes insane. (NOTE: Actual Young Dre Rap to Come.) As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his hand and up his arm. Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild... MC Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see if this Eminem melts in yo ass and in your hand.

The crowd LAUGHS. Brad tries to regain his composure... BRAD Can we start again?   I lost my place. TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of runny ink. He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now -- collectively making the \"choke\" sign. BRAD I'm cool... I'm cool. Brad finally starts up. BRAD 'You big and rough, You act all tough, I bet in your childhood You never had much love.

SEAN What was that? A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the lid. ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old Wonder Bread. PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of the dumpster. \n48    BY BAR                                                       48 \nBRAD So you saying if I put my mind to it I can be whatever I want to be?

She thinks, smiles, then sits down next to him on the bed. Brad sits up and looks at her face in the moonlight. BRAD You're so pretty. SHONDRA Thank you. Brad leans in and kisses her tenderly. She kisses him back. Encouraged, Brad opens his mouth wide and tries to stick his tongue down her throat. She pushes him back. SHONDRA I said kiss, fool. Damn. \nShe gets up and heads for the door.

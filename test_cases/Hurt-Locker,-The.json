{"train": "THOMPSON Need to keep my options open. \nThompson twists to get his chest protector on. Eyes tight, brow furrowed, squints into the far distance. That's going to be a mean motherfucker. \nTHOMPSON Okay. I'm going to make my approach. This area looks okay. No power-lines. Clean line of sight. If it looks alright when I get down there, I'm going to plug it in and we'll just blow it. Boom -- no more bomb -- give these people something to think about. (MORE) \nTHOMPSON (CONT'D) I want them to know if they're going to leave a bomb on the side of the road for us, we're going to blow up their little road. Leave them a crater and an ear ache. \nSanborn and Thompson put in their earplugs. \nSANBORN Ready? \nThompson nods. \nTHOMPSON I'm craving a hamburger, is that strange? \nNext, Sanborn takes a metal helmet with a thick glass front and seals Thompson's face in. Sanborn attaches the breathing hose. Taps his boss on the shoulder. \nSANBORN Not for you. (sealing him in) Happy trails. \nTHOMPSON (HEADSET) This is Blaster One. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy, that. Blaster One. You're good to go. \nThompson turns to face the white bag and begins his walk toward it. \nEXT.   ROAD    DAY \nThompson's stride is slowed by the eighty-pound suit...He CLUNKS down the road. Dust clouding from his boots... \nHe moves past the same mounds of charred and rotting stuff, inner tubes, soda bottles, crumpled cans, steaming animal waste, and bits of fluttering plastic that the bot passed... \nThe question is not - do you see a white garbage bag? It's which of these bags is the BOMB? \nSweat slides down into his eyes. \nTHOMPSON (HEADSET) 200 meters. It's boiling in here. \nUPRANGE \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. 200 meters. \nThe RASP of Thompson's BREATHING loud on Sanborn's walkie- talkie... \nDOWNRANGE \nThompson walks on. \nA knot of flies floats in the air in front of his helmet.    He lifts an arm and they disappear. \nThe desert sun glints off a nearby car and momentarily bleaches his mask bright white. \nA YOUNG GIRL with an INFANT BABY in her arms appears in a far off doorway, then withdraws out of sight. \nHe looks down, CAREFULLY watches his footfalls.   Garbage piled on top of garbage. \nUPRANGE \nEldridge and Sanborn are at the ready, scanning the area and watching Thompson. \nTHOMPSON (0.S) (OVER WALKIE) One hundred. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy, that. 100 meters out. \nDOWNRANGE \nThompson: careful footfalls on sand. \nBreathing. Heat.   Sun.   Sweat.   Flies. \nSuddenly a DOG out of nowhere charges, BARKING ferociously. \nThompson is momentarily startled.    Then resumes his walking. The dog runs off. \nThompson blinks more sweat out of his eyes. \nTHOMPSON (HEADSET) Twenty five. \nUPRANGE WITH SANBORN \nSanborn lifts the walkie.   Sweat in his eyes.   Wipes it away. \nSANBORN Copy twenty five. You're in the kill zone. \nTHOMPSON (HEADSET) Thanks for reminding me. \nEldridge nods.   Everything progressing nice and easy. \nDOWNRANGE WITH THOMPSON \nThompson is standing over the blasting cap. \nTHOMPSON (HEADSET) Alright. I'm here. I'm gonna put it in. \nSANBORN (OVER WALKIE) Copy that. \nThompson picks the blasting cap off the ground and looks up -- \nAs distant THUMP of approaching chopper wash quickly becomes super loud in his ears. \n--starts to run.   Fear in his eyes. \nBUTCHER \n--smiles back at Eldridge-- \nMACRO: thumb on send button of the cell phone. \nTHOMPSON \n--running full out now-- \nBOOM --- \n- Fireball blasts out from the bomb \n-- flattening Thompson \n-- Blood splatters the inside of his helmet. \n-- thick cloud of particulate matter roils out in slow motion \n-- hitting Eldridge and Sanborn -- turning them black. \nWith the roiling cloud we begin to float up and out over the entire city of Baghdad: \n--we see intersections jammed with traffic; American Humvees and tanks idle next to red-and-white taxis, beat-up Opals, the military and civilian mixed up in one snarling line, all competing for space, advantage... \n--we continue to rise until we take in the entire massive metropolis. Mosques and office towers ascend from a maze of dusty streets teeming with life despite two decades of war... \nThe roiling black cloud thins in a light breeze and we hard CUT TO: \nBLACK \nCUT TO: \nINT CAMP VICTORY   TRAILER   DAY \nA shaft of afternoon sun creeps past a plywood-covered window, faintly lighting the interior of a narrow, low- ceilinged room. \nIn the dimness we see contours: desk, chair, a large locker, and the silhouette of a MAN moving a cot away from the window. On the cot is a small duffle bag. \nWe hear a knock from the outside. \nThe man moving the cot stops. \nJAMES Yeah. \nSANBORN O.S. Sergeant James? \nJAMES It's open. \nThe door opens and in the light we see Sanborn. \nSANBORN Sergeant James. (extending his hand) J.T. Sanborn. Welcome to Bravo Company and welcome to Camp Victory. \nJAMES Victory? I thought this was called Camp Liberty. \nSANBORN (SHRUGS) They changed it last week. Victory sounds better. \nJAMES It's Will. Good to meet you J.T. \nSERGEANT WILLIAM JAMES extends a hand. A former DELTA soldier is in his late twenties, good-looking, appealing face, solid build, one of the lucky ones. And yet, look closer. In the right light, there's an unusual depth to his expression, to his eyes and all-American face, as if he's guarding an inner chaos that could rush out at any time. \nRight now, however, James is doing his best to act like a regular nice guy. \nSanborn looks around the empty room.   One duffle. \nSANBORN So, is that all you brought from Kabul? \nJames motions to the locker. \nJAMES Yeah. Here, give me a hand with this. \nSanborn helps James move the locker against the wall. \nJAMES By the window. \nThey push the locker over the window, blocking the light. It's very dark in the room now. \nJAMES A mortar once hit near my trailer -- boom -- a two inch piece of frag cut through the aluminum and flew this far (gesturing with his hands) over my head, past my balls and landed in my computer hard-drive. Where's the damn light? \nSanborn finds the switch in the corner. Then he comes back and taps the metal locker, testing its strength. \nSANBORN This should stop any lateral pieces. \nJAMES Yeah, I'm good unless it comes through the roof (smiles) in which case I'm gonna need a closed casket. \nSanborn doesn't like the joke, tries to change gears. \nSANBORN The accent -- you from Georgia? \nJAMES Tennessee.     Trailer park off I-5. \nSANBORN Oh, right. I'm from Vermont. You know, \"live free or die.\" Trees. Snow. Maple syrup. Pot. \nJames gives him a polite smile. \nSanborn soldiers on: \nELDRIDGE Well I guess it makes sense. Anybody comes alongside the Humvee, we're dead. Anybody looks at you funny, you're dead. Pretty much, the bottom line, is if you're in Iraq you're dead. How's a tank going to stop that? \nSANBORN Gimme a break, Owen. \nELDRIDGE (SMILING) Sorry. Just trying to scare the new guy. \nEXT   CAMP VICTORY/BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS   MORNING \nThe Humvee moves out of the base and into the outskirts of the city. Heat and sand and little else. \nINT   HUMVEE \nJAMES We had a few bombs up in Kabul too. \nELDRIDGE Sure, I bet you did. But you're going to be real busy here, boss. \nJames smiles, settles back in the seat. \nEXT   HUMVEE \nThe Humvee is now approaching a cluster of cars. \nINT   HUMVEE \nSANBORN Hey Owen -- watch the fucking road. \nEldridge moves up to the gunner's seat on top of the Humvee. \nEXT   HUMVEE \nEldridge has a collection of rocks he keeps in the gunner's nest and now he throws one at the car in front of him. The passenger turns around. \nELDRIDGE Imshee -- Imshee ! \nCUT TO: \nEXT BAGHDAD STREET   EARLY MORNING \nThe Humvee grinds to a stop on the outskirts of town. It's a place teeming with trash, with dwellings that look as beaten down as the people. The ghetto of the ghetto. \nJames is first out, Sanborn comes up behind him. \nEldridge climbs out of the turret. \nThey are now out in the open -- standing on Iraqi sand -- where anything can happen. \nSANBORN (TO ELDRIDGE) Clear here. \nEldridge nods and begins turning suspicious bits of plastic over with the tip of his boots. \nELDRIDGE Clear here. \nJAMES (looking around at the EMPTY STREET) Where are the guys who called this in? \nJames walks on. Sanborn and Eldridge exchange a glance `what the hell,' and follow him. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike. Interogative, Do you have an updated poz for the link- up? Has their position changed? \nAfter a moment a scratchy voice over his walkie. \nDISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Blaster Mike, this is Victory Main. Negative. Figures to follow. Three- four-five-three is your grid. You should have a visual on them right now. They're waving an American FLAG \nSanborn keys his GPSw unit. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative, Main. No one in sight. \nDISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Blaster Mike. You should have a visual, waving a flag. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) (looking at empty space) Well, that's were I am and I don't see any guys in fatigues, and I sure as hell don't see any American flag, Over. \nJames, Sanborn and Eldridge continue their slow walk down the street. An empty Humvee comes into view. \nELDRIDGE They abandoned their vehicle? \nJames walks forward. Unconcerned. Takes out a cigarette and lights it. Sanborn's walkie comes to life. \nDISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Roger, Blaster. I copied you the first time. \nJames approaches the empty Humvee. \nStops. Turns to see a tiny American flag being waved in the window of a nearby building. James jogs over to the building, opens the door. \nJAMES Hello boys -- \nLooking into a room full of SOLDIERS who are trying not to look afraid. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Yeah, thanks. Roger that. \nJAMES (TO SOLDIERS) Don't tell me the bomb is in there with you. \nA SERGEANT, slightly embarrassed, climbs out into the open and tries to act nonchalant. \nHe points down the block, which is a sea of trash and white plastic bags. \nSERGEANT (pointing far down the ROAD) Down on that block, one of our informants says there is an IED in a white plastic bag. \nJames has heard enough and even though the Sergeant may have more to say -- \nJAMES I'll get it. (turning to Sanborn) Break out the suit. (turning back to the SERGEANT) ) Keep your guys back. \nJAMES (HEADSET) Hell, I don't know. I'll let you know when I'm standing over it. \nWe see the world from James' point of view now, the city of Baghdad has taken on an intense and dreamy hue, as if we're in some sort of fugue state: \n--He looks down the strange, threatening Iraqi street. \nHe walks on. The suit is heavy, little puffs of sand with each footfall. The sun beats down. \nJames nears an intersection guarded on either side by a Humvee and several SOLDIERS, when... \nINTERSECTION \nSuddenly a red-and-white TAXI swerves past the SOLDIERS on the left side of the intersection. The soldiers take cover and shout contradictory commands - Get Down Motherfucker! Don't Move! Back up! Out of the vehicle! \nThe TAXI BRAKES in front of James. \nUPRANGE \nSanborn and Eldridge can hear the shouting but the lingering smoke still obscures their sight. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) JAMES -- \nELDRIDGE (shouting to Sanborn) Car! Car! A car stopped in front of him. \nJAMES \nJames' HEADSET WALKIE barks to life: \nSANBORN O.S. (HEADSET) Come back. \nJames pulls a pistol from his holster, and -- \nJAMES (HEADSET) I got it. \n-- shoots two rounds into the dirt, near the car's front tire. \nDRIVER'S FACE \nImpossible to read. Is he a taxi driver annoyed by the roadblock, or an insurgent fighter getting ready to blow a suicide bomb? \nONE OF THE ARMY SOLDIERS \nWith field glasses on the intersection he speaks into the walkie. \nSOLDIER (OVER WALKIE) EOD has a nine on this Haji in the car. I'm going to get two guys over there to back him up. \nSANBORN \nStill can't see clearly. Processing this information.   Turns to Eldridge. \nEldridge using his rifle scope as well - shakes his head.    No visual. \nSANBORN (into walkie to soldier) Negative, negative. You're too close to the IED-- (HESITATING) Stand down. EOD has the situation under control. \nSweat on his forehead. \nJAMES \nNow aiming at the windshield. But the driver is impassive. \nUPRANGE \nEldridge looks through his rifle scope. \nELDRIDGE (shouting to Sanborn) We're in a kill zone! \nINTERSECTION \nJames fires, shattering the windshield. But the car doesn't budge. \nJames is pissed. He lunges through the windshield and jams his gun into the driver's forehead. \nSOLDIER \nSOLDIER (INTO WALKIE) Three or four rounds fired. The nine is now pressing into the Haji's forehead. \nINTERSECTION \nThe gun digs into the driver's forehead. Beat. The driver shifts into reverse. \nHe rolls back to the soldiers, who then rush the car, yank the driver out, and deliver a savage beating as James looks on. \nJAMES \nJAMES (chuckling into his HEADSET) If he wasn't an insurgent he sure as hell is now. \nAnd he resumes his walk towards the white garbage bag and the rubble pile, noting possible threats -- a MAN in a window down the road. \nUPRANGE \nSANBORN (coolly, into walkie) Copy that. (MORE) \nSANBORN (CONT'D) But I have no idea what you're talking about, Blaster One, since I can't see you. Over. \nJAMES O.S. (HEADSET) I'll tell you later. James out. \nPILE OF RUBBLE \nOne of a million in this city. James draws near. Two wires protrude from the mess. \nINT. CAMP VICTORY    MESS TENT   DAY \nEldridge and Sanborn chowing down - two guys among a sea of SOLDIERS. Behind them in the mess tent hang the signs of various fast-food restaurants that cater to the troops: PIZZA HUT, SUBWAY, BURGER KING. \nSANBORN Ketchup? \nEldridge passes his ketchup over to Sanborn. \nELDRIDGE This is not Pizza Hut. (removing a slice of PEPPERONI) And this is not pepperoni. It's round and meaty, but it ain't pepperoni. \nSANBORN Goat meat, probably. \nELDRIDGE Goat meat pepperoni? I'd be glad if this was goat meat pepperoni. (MORE) \nELDRIDGE (CONT'D) I'd eat a truckload of goat meat pepperoni. No, this is something else. (slapping the fake pepperoni on the table) This is unholy. \nSANBORN Pray for something better -- and while you're at it, pray for a new team leader. \nELDRIDGE You sure you want to be the guy in the bomb suit? \nThey see James at a food station. \nSANBORN Be better than him. \nJames approaches the table. \nELDRIDGE Hey, James. \nJames sits down to an awkward silence. Eldridge stops eating. Considers him. \nELDRIDGE (TO JAMES) That was some crazy shit you pulled out there. \nJAMES Yeah? \nELDRIDGE Hell yeah. You're either really lucky or really good. Right up on the car like that. Gun to the head. Crazy. You know it might backfire on you someday. You know that. You might actually die. And then what? \nJames is puzzled. \nJAMES I don't know, what? \nELDRIDGE You don't meet your maker. You just get vaporized into little bits of DNA. \nSanborn watches Eldridge closely. Is he referring to Thompson? \nSANBORN (trying to be helpful) He asks everyone what they think about death. Ever since Thompson was KIA. \nJames nods, turns to Eldridge: \nJAMES I don't think about it. Waste of time. \nJames goes back to eating.     Eldridge keeps looking at him, then lets it go. \nEXT. CAMP VICTORY   MESS TENT   DAY \nMidday in Iraq. The heat is oppressive, biblical. \nJames, Sanborn and Eldridge emerge into the blazing sun and the tumult of the base. Trucks barrel by. And troops -- everywhere, troops. \nJames stops in front of young Iraqi KID selling pirated DVDs, while Sanborn and Eldridge continue on to the head shed. The kid, whose name is PELE, has DVDs fanned on a table. \nPELE One for five, two for nine. \nJAMES (HAVING FUN) Three for twelve? \nPELE Three for thirteen. And for you, no tax. \nJAMES (laughing, fishes out a five) Keep the change. \nEXT   HEAD SHED   PORCH \nSanborn is smoking a cigarette and watching James buy DVDs, weighing him, when the team's FIRST SERGEANT, stocky with a paternal way about him, holds out a white envelope to Sanborn. \nFIRST SERGEANT The tags finally came. Figured you'd want to be the one to take them over.(handing Sanborn the ENVELOPE) \nSANBORN Thanks, I will handle it. \nThe Sergeant nods. Sanborn stuffs the envelope in his back pocket. And the Sergeant heads inside, walking past -- \nINT   HEAD SHED   SIDE OFFICE \nA small office space with the door opened a crack. Behind the door, Eldridge is sitting on a swivel chair, looking at a computer screen, playing a computer game. Next to him in another swivel chair is LT. COL. JOHN CAMBRIDGE, a MILITARY PSYCHIATRIST, who is looking at Eldridge and the screen. \nELDRIDGE (singing the jingle) \"Be all that you can be,\" right? But what if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road? \nLT. COL CAMBRIDGE I'd like to see you move past this feeling that you're going to die, Owen. \nELDRIDGE (looking at the screen) Why? I think it's logical. This is a war, right Doc? People die all the time. Why not me? \nLT. COL CAMBRIDGE That's true. But what concerns me is how much you think about it. You have to change the record in your head, think about other things. \nELDRIDGE What do you think about? \nLT. COL CAMBRIDGE I don't dwell on death.(looking at his watch) I don't obsess. You understand what I'm getting at? \nEldridge looks up at last. \nEXT CAMP VICTORY JAMES' TRAILER    NIGHT \nJames stands before the open door of his trailer with the satellite phone in hand. Overhead a canopy of stars blinks. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES ...So in sixteen months time I believe five million gallons per day is in fact rather conservative. \nSOUNDS out the window. An Executive turns his head nervously. \nEXECUTIVE But security is still the big variable? \nThe Ambassador brushes his hand in dismissal. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Only on the margins. (SMILING) Everyday, the risks diminish and the rewards multiply-- \nEldridge enters. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Ah, and here is EOD. You see gentlemen, everything is fine. The site is secure. The bomb -- if there even is one -- will easily be dispensed by the crack American team. \nELDRIDGE Excuse me. \nEldridge rushes over to the window to see the street. \nELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Blaster Mike, I'm at the window. \nSANBORN \nHe's stationed himself near the mouth of the alley.   Wisps of smoke and flames in the air. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. How's the fire look from up there. \nAMBASSADOR'S OFFICE \nELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Flames a meter high, over. \nJAMES \nClose to the burning car. SMOKE rising from the hood and the under carriage awash in FLAMES, like a sleeping dragon. \nJames sprays the fire-extinguisher and the fire subsides. He inspects the interior - looks normal enough - and tries to open the trunk with a pair of pliers, but the handle doesn't give and snaps off under his effort. He kicks the trunk but it remains shut. He turns and lumbers up range, jaw set. \nSANBORN \nWatching James walk back uprange. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, what is going on? \nJAMES O.S. (HEADSET) Stay put, I'll be right back. \nStanding alone in the kill zone at the mouth of the alley. \nELDRIDGE (OVER WALKIE) What's happening? \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Good question. But I'm not liking it. \nHUMVEE \nJames is buried inside the Humvee, searching. He tosses what he doesn't need, and a succession of items comes flying out -- food, clothing, a tarp. Now James walks back towards the Blue Opal without saying a word. In his hand is a crowbar. \nBLUE OPAL \nJames winds up and swings hard at the door. Wham! Nope. Wham! Wham! Wham! \nHe drops the crowbar and tries the trunk. Presto, it opens, revealing: a trunk overflowing with EXPLOSIVES -- ten times what we've seen before. James is taken aback. \nJAMES (HEADSET) We're all in the kill zone on this one. \nSANBORN \nSanborn stares at James and the car. Great. \nJAMES \nNow inside the car, slipping on the slimy seats, he cuts the seat cushions with his knife, and rips out the foam upholstery, and finds more bad news buried underneath: SIX ARTILLERY SHELLS and a WIRE that leads to the floorboard and goes under the carpeting. \nJames DIVES to the wire and cuts it, then rips open the carpet to reveal more wire -- and follows the wire through the car, ripping apart the car PIECE by PIECE, cutting wire as he goes. \nAMBASSADOR'S OFFICE \nAn executive gets up to look out the window. \nELDRIDGE (TO EXECUTIVE) Sir, I'm going to need you to stay away from the window. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Yes, please, sit down. It's safe. \nEXECUTIVE Why is he here, if it's safe? \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES He is just an observer. \nEXECUTIVE (TO ELDRIDGE) Is that true, we're safe here? \nELDRIDGE (DISTRACTED) In my opinion, no. \nExecutives take this as a cue to leave. Getting up, shuffling out of the room. The Ambassador is furious at Eldridge, advancing on him. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES This is idiotic. Why not tow the vehicle away from the building? \nELDRIDGE I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee, Sir. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Donkeys.   Use donkeys. \nELDRIDGE I don't believe we have any of those on hand, Sir. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Jesus, Lord. You Americans really are incompetent. No donkeys on hand? What do you think I'm talking about, a full squadron of farm animals? \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative, Negative. Hold your fire. (shouting at bicyclist) Get the fuck out of here! \nThe bicyclist does an about face, but not before casting a last suspicious glance back at the car bomb. \nSanborn refocuses on the Opal; he's losing his cool. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, do you copy, over? \nJAMES \nStill sitting in the back seat. Now he sees the smoking vent. \nJAMES (HEADSET) Gimmie a minute. \nELDRIDGE \nEyes never leaving the street below, flicks the safety of his rifle back on. \nGeddes notices the sweat on Eldridge's face, and feels a sudden surge of sympathy for the younger man. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Well done.     That took great self control. \nELDRIDGE Thank you, sir. Again, I apologize for the intrusion into -- \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES Yes, but I doubt the insurgents will appreciate your restraint. (in a kindly, paternal tone) If I may give you a piece of free advice, next time, pull the trigger. \nELDRIDGE Well, actually, the uh--rules -- \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES That's the only way out, I'm afraid. When you're in a losing battle, you have to draw blood. No insurgency in modern history has ever been truly defeated, so all you can do is manage your exit. Clear a wide swath of bodies so you have room to withdraw. \nSuddenly the office door opens and a YOUNG AIDE appears. \nAIDE The building is empty, Sir, except for you. \nGeddes nods, grabs his coat and moves to Eldridge for one last jab. \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES I'm sorry to say it, but that's just how it's done. You need to show some vigor. In Kenya, we executed the insurgents in their beds, until they gave us room. Falklands, the same. That's just how it's done. \nEldridge looks up, he's had enough.   Swings around. \nELDRIDGE Is that how you did it in Northern Ireland? With murder? \nAMBASSADOR GEDDES (SMILING) There you are. Now you're showing some vigor. \nAnd leaves. \nELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) J.T, the building is clear now. We can pull out. \nSANBORN \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Roger that. (to James) Will, we can pull out. The building is evacuated. (NO ANSWER) James? \nStill no answer. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, we are cleared to leave this fucking site. Walk away. Do you copy, over? \nJAMES \nJAMES (HEADSET) Stay where you are, Sanborn. I'm not done. \nAnd with that, James turns off his walkie.      CLICK. \nELDRIDGE \nELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) J.T., are we moving? \nSANBORN \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative. Negative. \nELDRIDGE O.S. (OVER TALKIE) I didn't copy that. Did you say negative? \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Roger. We are staying until James is finished. (NERVOUSLY) James, what's the situation? (NO ANSWER) Goddamn, Will, I need a report. \nJAMES \nJames' POV. He sees in the corner of the back seat, having just wiped away a puddle of fire retardant, a little black box, with a wire leading out of it. He grabs the box. \nJAMES Got it. \nBLUE OPAL \nThe black box goes flying out of the car. \nEXT   MOUTH OF CUL DE SAC \nSanborn is furious, stalking ahead of James as they return uprange. \nSanborn passes Eldridge, who has come down from the ambassador's office. \nSANBORN Take the suit. \nHUMVEE \nJames' face looks flushed, red, sweat dripping. Eldridge begins ripping apart the Velcro from James' legs. \nMOMENTS LATER \nJames sits in the car, smoking. \nDAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 17 \nCRATER \nJames is inside a CRATER in the middle of the road, working on an EIGHT-FOOT MISSILE. He attaches A ROCKET WRENCH, a metal band with two explosive tubes, to the nose of the missile -- and flips a switch. \nThe two   tubes ignite like a firecracker, shooting small flames.   Then the flames grow and band spins and FLIES off, ZIPPING   into the air above James' head like a metal frisbee, landing   fifty feet away. \nJames peers into the nose cone.    A hollow void. \nSANBORN (OVER WALKIE) James? Do you copy? James? \nHe climbs to the top of the crater. \nJAMES (INTO HEADSET) It's empty. \nEXT/INT CRATER   MOMENTS LATER \nThe soldiers are gathered around the pit to see EOD work. It's not everyday you get to see an eight foot missile towed out of a hole. \nJames is down in the pit. Sanborn hands him a chain. Working together, they wrap it around the missile. When they're done, Sanborn signals Eldridge, who is behind the wheel of the Humvee, ready to tow the missile out of the crater. \nSANBORN (TO ELDRIDGE) Rock it out, slowly. \nThe chain creaks, then stops. The tires spin uselessly. \nSANBORN (CONT'D) Try gunning it. \nThe tires only spin faster. \nSanborn moves to get a closer look. His knees come very near to the creaking chain. \nJAMES (seeing this from the pit) Sanborn, watch that chain. \nSANBORN It's alright. \nWhen... \nKA-BOOOOM -- the sky flashes orange overhead --James flat on his back, dazed. A shard of metal ZOOMS into the pit, missing him by inches -- as the soldiers dive into the pit for cover, shouting \"RPG, RPG!\" \nHUMVEE \nEldridge, who is in the driver's seat, starts shooting his M4 rifle. \nELDRIDGE (SHOUTING) What am I shooting at? \nSanborn jumping into the Humvee. \nSANBORN (SHOUTING BACK) I don't fucking know! -- but James is down!!! \nHe fires in the same direction as Eldridge. The Humvee gets peppered with bullets. The armor holds. But it doesn't look like it's going to last for much longer. \nSanborn grabs Eldridge. And they dive back into the pit, joining James and THREE SOLDIERS: a SERGEANT one PRIVATE and a CORPORAL who is a SNIPER. \nJames is sitting up, taking off his bomb suit. He appears to be unharmed. \nROAD \nOne of the soldiers is in the turret of a Humvee, firing the big .50 machine gun in all directions. \nCRATER \nSERGEANT (TO SNIPER) Get up there with your Barret and help him out. \n[Note: Barret is the large .50 SNIPER RIFLE carried by one of the soldiers, a specialty gun with an extremely long range.] \nThe SNIPER hoists the heavy gun to the edge of the crater and looks down the scope. \nAs he does, Sanborn, Eldridge, and James, and the other soldiers pop up and lay down covering fire. Then they quickly pop back down. \nROAD \nThe soldier in the Humvee is still churning his machine gun, shooting in all directions, expending hundreds of bullets a minute. \nCRATER \nSNIPER (TO SERGEANT) I don't see nothing out there. Chris is shooting wild. \nSERGEANT (INTO WALKIE) Hey Chris - can you hear me? Chill out on the fifty man. \nROAD \nThe soldier in the Humvee fires a few more seconds. Picks up his walkie. \nSOLDIER (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. \n-- As a bullet hits him in the neck, killing him instantly. \nCRATER \nSNIPER Holy shit. He killed Chris. \nEveryone in the pit pops up and fires in every direction, a knee-jerk response. \nA soldier picks up his walkie and keys it. We can't hear him talking over the retorts of the soldiers firing rifles. \nThe men are pinned down, paralyzed by fear. Sniper fire from one of the buildings rakes the top of the crater. \n-- Bullets kick up sand on the far side of the crater, opposite the men. \nJAMES Good. There's another one just behind him. Up a meter. \nSanborn fires once. Audible exhale. \nJAMES Good. \nJames scans the area. Silence. \nCRATER AN HOUR LATER \nThe sun lower in the sky. Around the pit, the fallen soldier has been pushed to one side, and the living are hanging on to their sanity. \nEldridge and the remaining soldier have exhausted their water supply. \nSanborn and James are in EXACTLY the same position as when we left them. Focused. Sanborn's finger on the trigger. Sanborn breathes out, the sniper breathing. He's been doing this for an hour, time and the desert heat have taken their toll. \nSanborn blinks sweat away. \nSANBORN POV \nThe scope BLURS. He regains focus. \nJAMES \nNoticing Sanborn's fatigue. \nJAMES Eldridge, grab me the juice out of an MRE. \nEldridge digs around the DEAD SOLDIER'S backpack and retrieves a packet of juice, which he passes to James. \nJames inserts the straw into the juice pack. \nHe hesitates, not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture after all the hostility that's passed between them. But he brings the straw to Sanborn's lips. \nAt first, Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope. But then he opens his parched mouth, and sips. \n--Suddenly, there's movement, a flutter of fabric, in the distance off Eldridge's shoulder. He stiffens. \nELDRIDGE Uh, Will. \nJAMES Yeah. \nELDRIDGE At my one o'clock. Two hundred meters. Something moved behind a parked car. Either a tan dog or a man in a light-colored shirt. \nJAMES Deal with it. \nELDRIDGE Uh--Ok. \nEldridge looks down his scope, unsure. James keeps his focus forward on the building. \nELDRIDGE I don't think it's a dog.   Should I fire? \nJAMES It's your call. \nEldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle. \nThere's a flutter of movement in the distance. \nEldridge pulls the trigger. Spraying the car in the distance. Empties his entire magazine. \nFrom behind the car, something falls to the ground, and the tiniest sliver of a rifle clatters after it. \nThe soldier in the pit comes over to Eldridge to see what he's done. \nSOLDIER Good hit, man. \nJames and Sanborn don't turn around. \nEldridge slumps, spent. \nCRATER TWO HOURS LATER \nSun casting long shadows. \nJames and Sanborn in the same focused position. Eldridge still watches the rear. \nThe soldier in the pit reaches his breaking point. \nSOLDIER I'm going to go for the Humvee. What do you say? \nSERGEANT I don't know. \nSOLDIER We've been here two hours and they ain't seen nothing. I'm going to go for it. \nAnd with that he dashes up and out of the crater. \nSanborn keeps his eye on the scope. \nROAD \nThe soldier runs to the Humvee, gets in, and turns the vehicle around, driving it back to the pit. \nHe dives out of the vehicle and back to the pit. \nSOLDIER (EXCITED) Those fuckers are dead. \nSERGEANT What if they hit us with an RPG when we get out? What if they were just waiting for us to get in the Humvee. \nSOLDIER It's safe. I'm telling you (TO SANBORN) You got those fuckers. \nA gust of wind rattles the front door. \nSANBORN That punch was harder than I hit you. I'm owed a good one. \nJAMES Alright. \nELDRIDGE Hold on, we need some rules. No face shots. \nJames lifts off his shirt, getting into fighting mode. Eldridge picks up a marker and begins to draw a bulls-eye on James' stomach, stopping when he sees a cluster of scars. \nJAMES Beauty mark, my mother dropped me at birth. \nELDRIDGE Looks like frag scars. \nSanborn slugs James. James doubles over, loses his balance and falls back. James gets up, laughing so hard it hurts. Tears of laughter falling down his face. \nJAMES Ahhhh! Excellent. Now your turn. \nSanborn braces for the blow. James gets ready to strike, then fakes a swing -- his fist stops just shy of Sanborn's cheek. \nSanborn's eyes go wide as -- James nails him with his other hand, right in the gut -- Sanborn doubles over. \nJAMES (LAUGHING) Looks like it hurt. \nMoving forward aggressively, suddenly James looks like he could kill. A complete change in his demeanor, as wind rocks the trailer, causing the light bulb to rattle and cast a STRANGE SHADOW \n-- then James rushes Sanborn, tackling him -- they crash into the corner of the room -- in a flash James is on top of Sanborn, pinning him -- Sanborn moves to punch James but James pins his hands -- James taps Sanborn lightly on the cheek, caressing his cheek. \nJAMES There there. It'll be okay. \nSANBORN Get off of me you freak. \nSanborn tries to buck James off. Forcefully raising his hips. \nJAMES Oh yeah, ride me, ride me. \nSanborn reaches for his boot knife. He flicks it open, brings the blade to James' throat. Their eyes lock. James dismounts, laughing. Stumbles back to the table. \nJAMES You're alright, Sanborn. Let's have another. \nCUT TO: \nEXT CAMP VICTORY   LATER \nThe wind is blowing harder, kicking up sand. Overhead, a full moon is blazing. \nJames looks up at the moon. It's dazzling. James and Eldridge support Sanborn as they weave towards Eldridge's trailer. \nJAMES I got him. \nEldridge passes Sanborn off to James, and heads up the stairs to his trailer. \nELDRIDGE Later. \nSanborn sags. James pulls him back. They walk a little farther to Sanborn's trailer -- \nJAMES Okay. Here we go big boy. \nAnd half carries Sanborn up the steps. \nINT. SANBORN'S TRAILER \nJames eases Sanborn onto a cot, and as he falls onto the cot, the WHITE ENVELOPE falls out of his pocket. \nSANBORN Do you think I have what it takes to get in the bomb suit? \nJames didn't expect this. \nJAMES Sure. \nJames picks up the white envelope and puts it on Sanborn's night table. \nHe looks back. Sanborn is already asleep. \nEXT   CAMP VICTORY   AFTER MIDNIGHT \nThe whole camp is asleep but James is standing outside, holding a satellite phone. He's swaying. Drunk. \nCONNIE O.S. (SLEEPILY) James, my God, what time is it? Are you alright. \nPause. \nCONNIE O.S. James? \nJAMES (SLIGHTLY SLURRED) I'm doing fine, babe. How are you? \nCONNIE O.S. Well, you woke me up. But - ah - we - we're fine. (getting more lively) Will junior said \"bobba\" He means bottle, but he's talking, Will. \nJames looks around the camp. All he sees is its immensity, the tremendous scope of the operation. This is military might, raw power. As good as it gets. \nJAMES Great. I'll call you tomorrow when you're awake. \nCONNIE O.S. Will, I can't wait until you come home. \nSilence. \nCONNIE (CONT'D) Will? \nJAMES (trying his best to mean IT) Yeah, me too. \nJAMES What the hell does that mean? \nELDRIDGE Healthy. \nJAMES You're healthy? Well, why not. \nThey go back to eating. \nSanborn joins James and Eldridge. \nSANBORN What's up team? \nThey nod silently as he sits. Sluggishly he throws his hand down on the table. \nSANBORN Can I get a Huu-haa? \nEldridge slaps a tired hand on top of Sanborn's. James follows suit. They wearily lift their arms in mock enthusiasm. \nAll at once:   \"Huu-haa.\" \nSanborn wolfs down some food. \nJAMES I'm going back to sleep now. \nELDRIDGE Let's roll. \nThey get up to bus their trays. And nearing the dirty-tray bin, the flaps of the tent billow more and more vigorously. Outside, a storm is brewing. \nEach man unfurls the checkered scarf around their neck and wraps their face for the wind. \nEXT CAMP VICTORY    DAY \nWind rakes sand and dust over the tent city, giving it an otherworldly aspect. Throngs of men and vehicles fight the swirl. It impedes their every move. \nThe three men continue onwards, as the intensity of the storm grows. \nEXT HEAD SHED DAY \nThe storm is HOWLING now. Visibility is reduced to a few feet. Red sand blows mercilessly. It's Mars. \nTITLE OVER: \nDAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 16 \nAs they approach the head shed, a Humvee comes blasting out of the storm from the other direction. It skids to a halt in front of them. \nThree wounded EOD TECHS and an EOD TEAM LEADER tumble out. \nThey look awful. One step shy of death. One man's face is smeared brown. Blood oozes from a deep gash in his cheek. Another tech is covered in black soot. Their hands still clutch their weapons -- the battle still wages in their minds. \nTEAM LEADER (shouting to James) It was a car bomb. Fucking nasty one -- they had a decoy detonator set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened -- then, I'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom!!! If I hadn't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead right now. \nELDRIDGE Get a Medic to look at your cheek. \nThe wounded TEAM LEADER touches his face and blood smears on his hand...he looks down...surreal to see your own blood. The First Sergeant trots over. \nTEAM LEADER (amazed at the sight of HIS BLOOD) ) It's no big deal. (now turning his attention back to James) ) Be careful. They're starting to hide the detonator really well. \nThe FIRST SERGEANT turns his attention to James: \nFIRST SERGEANT Sorry to ruin your day off, but your team is up. \nJames blinks back sand and dust blowing into his eyes. \nSo much for the nap. \nINT HUMVEE    CAMP VICTORY   PARKING LOT \nLt. COL. CAMBRIDGE knocks on the window. Startling the men. His face appears in the sand storm. \nLT. COL. CAMBRIDGE (SHOUTING) Are you guys about to go out? \nJAMES Yeah. \nLT. COL. CAMBRIDGE Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time. \nJames shoots Eldridge a look.   Eldridge shrugs. \nJAMES Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege. \nThe LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE gets in. As they drive out. \nJAMES Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin. \nEXT. ABU GRAIB CENTER   BOMBED OUT BUILDING   DAY \nA partially destroyed building fills the screen. A mess of bricks and rebar. Wind swirls sand up into the air. \nNearby, an OLD IRAQI MAN with a DONKEY drawn cart is unloading new bricks to repair the building. \nFarther up the road, a good distance from the building, are two parked Humvees. Nearby, James and his team are talking to a small cluster of SOLDIERS. \nSOLDIER 1 (pointing back at the BUILDING) Right up those stairs. \nJAMES You been inside already? \nSOLDIER 1 In there? Fuck no. We've had reports of all kinds of shit coming out of that house -- and-- \nJames takes his eyes off the building and turns to the Soldier. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Roger. I'll see if we can push this ahead. \nJames squats down, rests his rifle, looks at the floor. \nMoments pass and he feels a set of eyes on him. \nHe swivels his head to the left and makes eye contact with the dead kid on the table. The face doesn't have any of the markers of death; it looks alive. \nJames turns away, then is compelled to make eye contact again. He looks at his watch. The seconds tick by all too slowly. He grabs his walkie-talkie. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Fifteen is not going to work. I need to do this now. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Roger, I understand. If it was me, I would go for it, but I don't think command is going to budge under the circumstances. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Tell command I'm in a fucking war zone. And I'm going to blow now. \nJames gets up, clips his rifle, and takes the last few steps out of the room. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Blaster One, I don't know who you know, but you got your permission. Ready to det any time you say so. \nAt the door he stops to look at the dead boy on the table. He looks and looks. Finally: \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Cancel that det. \nCUT TO: \nJAMES \nReaching over the body of the boy. He pulls the artillery shell out of the boy's abdomen with his bare hands. He wipes his hands on his pants. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) This is Blaster One, I'm coming down. \nINT   BOMBED OUT BUILDING \nJames carries the body down the staircase. The head and feet bump the sides of the staircase as he descends. \nEXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING     MOMENTS LATER \nThe BODY lies on the street, James standing over it. A blue and white pickup TRUCK emblazoned with the logo of the Iraqi National Police pulls up to their position. \nA pair of POLICEMEN get out and after a few words with James, they load the body. \nHUMVEE \nSanborn and Eldridge sit across from each other, watching James. \nELDRIDGE ...So you really don't think it was the DVD kid? \nSANBORN No, I don't. \nELDRIDGE You're positive? \nSANBORN Yeah. Could it be? One in a million chance. \nELDRIDGE I don't know. Will seemed positive. But that was weird. \nSANBORN Very weird. \nThey look out the window and notice Lt. Colonel Cambridge down the street surrounded by a crowd of IRAQI MEN. \nCAMBRIDGE \nCambridge is trying to talk to several of them at once. \nCAMBRIDGE This is not a safe area for you. Imshee! \nThey don't leave. Cambridge lifts his rifle, not quite shouldering it. Then one MAN, mid thirties, in a suit, steps forward. \nIRAQI MAN (FLAWLESS ENGLISH) Why do you talk to us like children. We are not children. \nCAMBRIDGE Gimme a break, will you? \nIRAQI MAN Why should I? \nCambridge, suddenly not so sure of himself, looks back to the Humvee and sees -- \nJAMES \nWatching the police truck drive away. He then moves for the Humvee, motioning for Cambridge to load up. \nINT   HUMVEE \nEldridge guzzles some water.    Wipes sweat from his brow. \nELDRIDGE But then Will's pretty weird. He keeps bomb parts under his bed. \nPassing the water to Sanborn. \nSANBORN I bet you he doesn't put this one under his bed. \nSanborn laughs. \nJames cracks the door, jumps inside. \nHe sees Cambridge walk past the brick pile that the OLD IRAQI MAN had created. The man is no longer there. Something crosses his mind when-- \n--The brick pile explodes in a A SICKENING BLAST, obliterating Cambridge and flipping the Humvee \n--James, Sanborn and Eldridge SPIN upside down as the Humvee is buffeted by the blast - landing upside down. \nGUARD Are you cleared to leave the camp through this gate, Sir? \nJames nods. \nGUARD I'm going to need to see your ID again. \nJAMES Don't fuck with me man, I'm having a bad day already. \nThe guard stares at James. James stares at the guard. The guard shrugs, waves James through. \nEXT BAGHDAD STREET     NIGHT \nThe truck goes down a series of streets. It comes into a poor neighborhood and stops at a house. \nDVD MAN Pele. \nJAMES Wait here. \nJames gets out. \nEXT BAGHDAD STREET     HOUSE \nThe dwelling is set back behind a low wall. Hard to see much of it in the dim light. \nJames takes a step forward, toward the wall. \nSUDDENLY-- \nthe DVD truck peels out. \nJames looks at its retreating tail lights. A moment of indecision as he considers his situation: alone in Baghdad. \nThen he vaults the low wall, landing in \nEXT BAGHDAD COURTYARD \nA modest courtyard. Light comes from one window in the house, the rest is dark. Crickets. \nJames walks around to the back of the house. There's a door. He tries the knob. It opens. \nINT IRAQI HOUSE      HALLWAY \nIn a dark hallway. Murmuring of a television. James moves towards the noise. \nINT IRAQI HOUSE   ANTECHAMBER \nJames comes to an antechamber. Behind it is a very low stone archway. He goes through the archway, where - \nINT IRAQI HOUSE   LIVING ROOM \nA MAN -- call him Kalim -- older, fifties, dressed in traditional garb, sits at a table drinking tea, watching an Egyptian game show on television. \nJames walks in, gun drawn. \nThe man is spooked. He spills his tea, looks wildly for an exit. \nJames puts his fingers to his lips. \nJAMES Do you speak English? \nKALIM English, French, Arabic. \nJAMES (QUIETLY) I want the people responsible for Pele. \nKALIM For whom? \nJAMES Pele. The body bomb. \nKALIM Pele? I don't know. But please sit down. I am professor Kalim, this is my home. You are a guest. Sit. \nJAMES Take me to the people responsible. \nKALIM Of course, whatever you seek, I will help you find. Please, please sit, down. You are CIA, no? I am very pleased to have CIA in my home. \nJames raises his gun to aim at the man's face. \nJAMES Maybe you don't understand? \nThe man is suddenly very afraid. \nKALIM Please, be careful. Be slow. A gun can go off. \nAs the back door opens \n-- James spins to see \n-- a WOMAN, older, matronly. She sees James, his gun. And she starts shouting at James in Arabic, then English, \"Get out, get out.\" \nJames swings his gun to her. \nSUDDENLY-- \n-- behind the woman comes Pele. He runs to his father's side. \n-- James turns to the boy, to say something -- \n-- his mother is rushing James now, swinging a candlestick \n-- he spins to the door, trying to get out of there -- \nThere's no answer. \nWALL \nSANBORN He's gone. \nThey both drop to the ground on the other side. \nThey scan the ground with their flashlights. \nThe BODY of an Iraqi insurgent is lying close to where Eldridge had been standing. He's pulped from bullet wounds, and gasping for breath. \nJAMES This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots. \nHe scavenges the ground looking for brass casings. \nNothing. \nSANBORN Three shots, close range. He takes a step forward to see what he's hit. \nJAMES Another guy comes from behind him -- gets the drop on him. You're a hostage. \nThey look up and down the wall. \nSANBORN That way is towards the tanker, troops. \nDARK STREET \nThey run about fifty yards when Sanborn TRIPS, stumbles, James catches him as he falls, and they keep going. \nIn the distance, they see Eldridge's back and the backs of two other MEN, just as they are turning a corner. \nThey SPRINT to the corner, and pause to catch their breath as James hands Sanborn his flashlight. \nJAMES Hit `em with both lights on three. \nSANBORN Fuck. Okay. \nJAMES One. Two. \nSanborn shoulders his rifle and readies both spotlights. \nJAMES Three. \nThey spin around the corner - flash of light revealing NOTHING but an empty street. \nThey sprint to the next block, where Eldridge is being walked quickly at gun point. \nThe men's rifles are at his head. \nJAMES Again. One two three. Do it. Do it. \nSanborn shines the lights on the backs of both men. \nJames fires. Three shots at the guy on the left of Eldridge. Three shots at the guy on the right. \nSanborn kills the flashlights. \nJames goes running towards the group, Sanborn running next to him. Both have their guns up but lights off. \nThey get to the group and all three men are on the ground. Both Iraqis are dead -- shot clean in the back. \nEldridge is bleeding profusely from his leg, but he's alive. \nJames and Sanborn pick Eldridge up and drudge back with him. \nELDRIDGE Am I dead? \nJAMES No. You're fine. \nELDRIDGE Am I dead? Am I dead? Am I dead? \nOff James' face -- \nINT   CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS   LATER THAT NIGHT \nJames walks in. The room is empty. Florescent lights hum. James is still wearing his fatigues. His whole midsection is red with Eldridge's blood. \nJames heads to the shower and steps inside, fully clothed. He turns on the water. \nAims the shower head to his stomach. Sinks down so it can hit the bloody stains. \nAs the uniform grows wet, then gets soaked, the pinkish water swirls down the drain -- \nEXT   CAMP VICTORY   FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER \nJames and Sanborn emerge into the wind. \nSANBORN So how you doing with this? \nJAMES Fine. I'm fine. \nSANBORN Fine? You know I lied to our sergeant. (MORE) \nSANBORN (CONT'D) So Eldridge wouldn't have to go around saying he was shot by his own team leader. \nJAMES Yeah. Thanks. I'm just tired. \nSANBORN You want some sleeping pills? \nUPRANGE \nSANBORN (RELIEVED) Copy that. \n--When, suddenly, the SOUND of SOLDIERS SHOUTING in the distance catches Sanborn's ear. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Hustle back, something's going on. \nMOMENTS LATER \nJames comes back sweating profusely from his run. Sanborn helps take his helmet off. \nAs two SOLDIERS come running over. More SHOUTING in the distance, louder now. \"Hands on your head.\" \"Don't move asshole.\" \"Stop. Stop.\" \nIn addition, the sound of SHOUTING IN ARABIC. A loud jumble. \nOver that, SOLDIERS YELLING: \"Get back.\" \"Form a perimeter.\" \nA NERVOUS SOLDIER trots up to James and Sanborn. \nJAMES What's going on? \nNERVOUS SOLDIER We've got a situation with a suicide bomber. \nJAMES We'll follow you. \nThey follow the soldier down the road. The soldier is sweating, terrified. \nEXT   BAGHDAD ROAD \nThe road has been cordoned off by SOLDIERS on all sides. \nIn the middle of the road an IRAQI MAN IN A NEW BLACK SUIT is standing with his hands above his head. He's distraught. Hair mussed. \nA SERGEANT seems to have taken command of the situation, and now he alone is shouting to the man. \"Stay still. Don't Move. If you keep walking we will shoot you.\" \nA TRANSLATOR in a black ski mask is helping him get the message across. \nThe translator edges forward to talk to the BLACK SUIT man. \nSERGEANT Keep that translator back. \nOne of the soldiers grabs the translator. \nTRANSLATOR (to the soldier) But the bomb was forced on him. Against his will. He is not a bad man! \nJames and Sanborn and the NERVOUS SOLDIER come onto the scene. \nThe Sergeant turns to James and explains. \nSERGEANT He came walking up to our checkpoint, said he had a bomb strapped to him. He was sorry. He didn't want it to blow up. He begged us to take it off him. \nTRANSLATOR (TO JAMES) Help this man. He's not a bad man. \nSANBORN Not a bad man? You've got to be kidding me. (TO JAMES) This is a trap. He wants to draw people close to him. \nJAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) Tell him to open his jacket. I need to see the bomb. \nThe translator SHOUTS in Arabic and the MAN unbuttons his jacket, revealing several sticks of dynamite strapped to his chest. \nJAMES (to the soldier) With that much bang, I'd need a hundred meter perimeter. (TO TRANSLATOR) Tell him to get on his knees. \nThe translator SHOUTS. BLACK SUIT complies. \nSERGEANT Can we just shoot him? \nAs James considers that option when -- \nTRANSLATOR NO. He's not a bad man. He has a family. The bomb was forced on him. He is asking for help. Only help. \nJAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) I want you one hundred meters away, like everybody else. \nTRANSLATOR But how will I hear? \nJAMES You don't need to. I'm going down there. \nMeanwhile, the BLACK SUIT man is SHOUTING something in Arabic. \nJAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) What the fuck is he shouting now? \nTRANSLATOR He's asking you to hurry. He thinks the bomb has a timer on it. \nJames turns to Sanborn \nJAMES Where's that helmet? \nSanborn pulls James aside. \nSANBORN We've had our differences. Eldridge? That's water under the bridge. It happened. But this -- this is suicide. \nJames smiles at Sanborn. He just doesn't get it. \nJAMES That's why it's called a suicide bomb. \nSANBORN It's suicide for you, Will. \nJAMES Nah. That guy wants to catch an American? I'll give him an American. \nSanborn reluctantly hands him his helmet, and seals him in. \n--Down the road, sprinting now. Rifle flapping. \nDOWNRANGE \nSanborn skids to a halt, hands James the cutters. \nJames hands his gun to Sanborn, who holds it on the man's forehead. \nJames sets to work, applying the cutters to the thick metal holding the bomb to his chest. \nThe man is crying now. \nSanborn sees the Casio. It reads 4:00 \nSANBORN Holy shit. You weren't kidding. \nJAMES Nope. \nJames works the cutter blade. \nCU: Bolt Cutter. It SCRAPS futilely against the metal. \nJAMES (SOTTO) What is this made out of? \nBLACK SUIT Please. Please. \nSANBORN Case hardened steel. \nJames doubles his effort. \nCU: Bolt Cutter. The blade bites the steel, but it doesn't give. \nJames squeezes with all his might. \nJAMES Motherfucker. What's our time? \nSanborn looks at the Casio. \nSANBORN Three minutes. \nJAMES Shit. Ok. Let me think. \nHe puts the bolt cutter down on the ground. \nJAMES We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly. \nSANBORN I don't think we have one of those in the truck. \nCU: Casio Watch 2:30. \nJAMES Let's try the back of it. \nSanborn nods. Keeps the gun on the man's head. His hand is starting to shake. \nJames goes behind the man, and rips open the back of his shirt, revealing the back of the bomb. Here too it is a welded band, but the metal looks thinner. Weaker. \nJames works it with the cutter. \nCU: Casio Watch 1:30. \nSANBORN We have to bail. \nJAMES Go. I got the suit. \nSanborn looks at the guy. \nSANBORN What do you want me to do with the pistol? \nJAMES Take it with you, that's a good pistol. \nSANBORN When do you leave? \nJAMES In forty five seconds. \nSanborn turns, and begins running uprange. \nSANBORN (shouting to soldiers) Get back! Get back! \nThe soldiers turn and run. \nJames tries and tries to clip the metal. It's a no go. He comes around to face the man. \nJAMES I'm sorry. \nBLACK SUIT Please, please. \nJAMES The metal is too thick. \nBLACK SUIT Help me. Help me! \nJames drops the bolt cutter, kneels down in front of the man, and shakes his head. That's it. \nThe man understands James' gesture. He reaches forward, grabbing James' suit. \nBLACK SUIT No! No! \nJames clubs his hand away. \nJAMES Sorry. \nJAMES This traffic is pissing me off. \nSANBORN Where are we, anyway? \nJAMES I know where I am but I'm lost. \nThey drive on.   Dust off the desert floor blows into the WINDSHIELD -- \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT   KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE   SUPERMARKET   DAY \nA big one. Vast, hyper-hygenic, the aisles stretching on, loaded with glistening produce. Muzac. A cathedral to consumerism. \nWe find James walking through the supermarket, looking like a new man. His hair has grown, softening his features. He's scrubbed clean, dust free, and dressed in Bermuda shorts and a clashing Polo shirt. The All American Dad. A suburban softie. Pushing a shopping cart. \nWelcome home, son, for you are no longer in Baghdad.     You're in the \"big PX\" -- America. \nA beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of the aisle. She too, is pushing a shopping cart, and in it is a small BOY. She smiles at James, and says: \nYOUNG WOMAN Honey, you grab the barbecue sauce and I'll meet you in aisle four. \nAnd CONNIE JAMES smiles again, and pats her husband on the shoulder. \nNow James knows he's really home. \nJAMES \nPushes the cart over to the sauce section. Down the squeaky- clean aisle. \nHis progress is impeded by an OBESE WOMAN who is mulling over cat litter. Her overflowing cart blocks the aisle. \nJames stops. Hands tight on the shopping cart. He looks at her hard. She ignores him. Where's the 9mm when you need it? \nJames clears his throat. She sees him. Moves her cart. \nHe continues on, walking through the cavernous space. \nAt last, he's at the sauce section. He is rattled by the abundance after the bleakness of Iraq, and the array of choices is dizzying. \n--He reaches for a bottle, then pulls back, unsure. \n--Giving up, he picks a bottle at random and tosses it into the cart. \nINT KNOXVILLE   JAMES HOUSE   KITCHEN   MORNING SOME DAYS LATER \nJames is washing the vegetables they've just bought at the grocery store. Mushrooms bob in a pool of water at the bottom of the sink. James tries to clean them individually, but can't. They crumble in his hands. \nCONNIE Let's put the chicken on first and the vegetables on last, so they don't burn? \nJames struggles with the mushrooms. Makes no reply. \nCONNIE CONT'D Will? \nJAMES Yeah, okay. (beat) You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there. \nConnie knows where this is going, but she fights the inevitable. \nCONNIE Well, good thing the army is hiring, and they've got so many great guys over there. \nJAMES Uh-huh. \nJames wipes his hands on the dish towel and walks out. Looking at his retreating back, she accidentally knocks a glass off the counter, and it shatters. \nEXT   JAMES HOUSE    LATER THAT DAY \nA few NEIGHBORS have gathered for a barbecue in James' backyard. It's a simple, low-key affair. James is tending meat on a grill. \nINT   JAMES HOUSE    CONTINUOUS \nThe doorbell rings. Connie rushes to open it. It's Sanborn. She hugs him. \nCONNIE Thanks for coming. Maybe he'll listen to you. \nSANBORN I know how to talk to him. \nEXT   JAMES HOUSE    A LITTLE LATER \nBehind the barbecue, Sanborn finds a moment to confront James privately. \nSANBORN What the fuck is the matter with you? You got a family, kid, nice looking burgers. \nJames studies the grilling meat. \nJAMES I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you? \nSanborn holds up his hand. He's wearing a wedding ring. \nSANBORN I made the plunge. (big smile) But I thought we were talking about you. \nJAMES We just did, buddy. \nINT   JAMES' SON'S BEDROOM   LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe boy is in a cradle, face up and wide awake. James comes in to tuck him in. \nJames pulls a book of fairy tales off the shelf, flips through it. Can't read that fluff. \nHe pulls up a chair. Begins to play with a Jack-In-the-Box. He winds it up. \n", "test1_input": "THE HURT LOCKER \nWritten by \nMark Boal \nStory by \nMark Boal & Kathryn Bigelow \nFirst Draft REVISIONS \n\"The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug.\" \nChris Hedges, WAR IS A FORCE THAT GIVES US MEANING \n\"The worst imaginable news: war thrives because enough men still love it.\" TIME BLACK SCREEN \nOver the BUZZING sound of an electric engine we-- \nCUT TO: \nEXT STREET/DAWN \nA grainy, low-resolution view, seen from sixteen inches above street level. And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast. \nFrom this angle close to the ground we FLY down a road strewn with war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit -- all of which, from this odd, jarring perspective, looks gigantic, monstrous. \nWe zoom towards a crumpled COKE CAN, the white `C' growing enormous on the screen, filling the screen like a skyscraper. \nWe SMASH into the can and barrel ahead. \nA RAG flutters, blocks the view, then tumbles away, as we -- \n-- zoom downhill, see nothing but gray sand, then zoom back up hill and off, catching air, a flash of the horizon line, BRIGHT SUN, and land hard on a packed road. \nWe close in on one particular pile of trash, which is topped with a white plastic garbage bag, and stop. Puffs of dust and fluttering plastic. \nWe glide across the fluttering plastic. Flies buzzing. Advancing slowly, inch by inch, to the edge for our first glimpse inside the bag: \nA RUSTY ARTILLERY SHELL. \nCUT TO: \nEXT MIDDLE EASTERN STREET/DAWN \nA military ROBOT (about 3 feet long and 2 feet high, aka `the bot') that rolls on tank-like treads and has a mechanical hand and an array of CAMERAS is moving around the bag. \nTITLE OVER: \nBAGHDAD, IRAQ - JANUARY, 2005 \nThis is all taking place on a dusty stretch of road in a quiet section of Baghdad, barren except for a few shops, some cement houses and a couple of parked cars. \nTHE U.S. MILITARY HAS CONTROL OF THE CITY, BUT INSURGENT GROUPS ARE MOUNTING FRESH ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS ON 31 JANUARY 2005. \nTHEY'VE ADOPTED A DEADLY NEW TACTIC, USING I.E.D.s - IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES - TO AMBUSH AMERICAN TROOPS. THE BODY COUNT IS RISING. \nIN RESPONSE, THE ARMY HAS DEPLOYED THE LAST OF ITS ELITE BOMB SQUAD UNITS, HOPING THAT THESE THREE MAN TEAMS CAN DISARM THE BOMBS BEFORE THEY EXPLODE, AND STEM THE TIDE OF DESTRUCTION. \nSOUND of far off GUNSHOTS and CALL to prayer. \nSEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY SOLDIERS are moving PEDESTRIANS away from the bag. Another group of SOLDIERS is clearing out all the shops: bakery, sandwich shop, and a butcher shop. \nNext to a parked Humvee, THREE EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal, aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS are crouched over a laptop computer, looking at the screen and the same image of the metal artillery shell inside the fluttering plastic. \nSERGEANT MATT THOMPSON wipes at the sweat on his forehead. This is summer in the desert and the median temperature on this bright clear morning is 110 degrees. \nTHOMPSON It's to the left. \nThompson   tears open a mushy Snicker's. He is fleshy around the arms   and middle, but there's real muscle underneath the flab and   truth be told, after so many years in EOD, he's lost the need   to have a show-off build. \nSANBORN Going left. \nSERGEANT J. T. SANBORN works the joystick on the laptop. He is a strapping Iowa farm boy, with a thick back from bailing hay. In contrast to his bulky frame, his face is soft, open, kind. He has a relaxed demeanor. Which might lead you to think nothing ever bothers Sanborn. But if you thought that, you'd be mistaken. Before joining EOD, Sanborn was in Military Intelligence. He quit. Military Intel was too easy. \nTHOMPSON Up a little. \nLAPTOP SCREEN \nRusty artillery shell now almost full frame. \nSANBORN \nSANBORN There? \nTHOMPSON Closer. I want to see the ojive. \nZoom on the nose cone of the shell. \nThe third soldier leans in for a better look. \nSPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE is a tall, lanky young man, the youngest of the group. He's a fighter like the others but also a reader, and something of a thinker. Eldridge crouches behind the other two soldiers, sipping a bottle of water, eyes never leaving the screen. \nTHOMPSON Push it in. \nSANBORN I can't get it inside. \nTHOMPSON Pretend it's your dick. \n", "test1_true": "Eldridge laughs.   He clearly likes the two men he's with. \nTHOMPSON Let me try. \nSANBORN Give me a second. \nTHOMPSON Give me a crack at it. \nSANBORN Shit. Okay. \nThey change places.   Thompson now on the controls. \nTHOMPSON Hello mamma. See that? \nSANBORN Looks like a one-five-five. \nEldridge gets up and goes to the Humvee, fishes around inside. \nTHOMPSON Yeah. That can do some damage. \nSANBORN We're going to need a charge. \nEldridge is already on it, approaching with the four blocks of C4. He's done this enough to know what they need. \nELDRIDGE Figured four blocks. Hey with these four blocks and the ninety pounds, are we going to be far enough away? \nNow we see the tiny toy robot in the far distance -- far, far away. \nBehind the Humvee and on either side of the road INFANTRY SOLDIERS are still clearing civilian onlookers from nearby stores. \nThompson stands and takes a good look at his surroundings. \nTHOMPSON The blast is going to roll out there (pointing) the shell will probably kick out there (pointing), and most of the shrapnel is going to rain up in an umbrella pattern. Some smaller pieces and shell fragments will come out this way -- but we'll be okay if we are behind the truck. \nThe idea that he would be standing in the open amuses Eldridge. \nELDRIDGE You know I'll be behind the truck. \nTHOMPSON Nothing wrong with that, Owen. Let's get the area cleared-- (looks around at the crowd OF ONLOOKERS) --as best we can, then load up the bot. \nEldridge double times it over to a nearby soldier. Together they herd away various bystanders. \nCUT TO: \nDOWNRANGE \nThe bot dutifully makes its return voyage to the plastic bag, this time towing a cart which is loaded with C4 and a blasting cap, and a coil of unspooling detonation wire. \nThe robot hits a bump causing the blasting cap to tumble to the ground, where it begins to roll -- \nUPRANGE \nEveryone cringes.   The cap doesn't explode. Close call. \nSANBORN Damn. \nDOWNRANGE \nThe blasting cap has rolled into a gully, out of reach of the robot hand. \nUPRANGE \nSanborn wiggles the stick.      It's not happening. \nSANBORN Matt, the bot's not going to do it. \nTHOMPSON Keep trying. \nDOWNRANGE \nThe robot hand tries again. No dice. \nUPRANGE \nTHOMPSON Okay, you're right. I have to go down there - don't you think? \nSanborn nods. \nTHOMPSON I don't want to wait around here in this neighborhood anyway. \nSANBORN (WRYLY) What, you don't like it here? \nTHOMPSON Let's just get me dressed. \nCUT TO: \nHUMVEE \nSanborn unpacks \"THE SUIT.\" A bizarre contraption that looks like an astronaut suit and helmet crossed with the Michelin Man. Because of its weight and complexity it takes two men to put it on - or one Sanborn. \nSanborn kneels down and guides Thompson's feet into the suit's black boots, then lashes up a series of Velcro straps to secure the armor, like a squire working on a knight. \nA strap near the crotch prompts Thompson to wisecrack: \nTHOMPSON Watch it. \nSANBORN (SMILING) I thought you already had your children, Sergeant. \n", "test1_id": 894, "test2_input": "SANBORN Fuck, Owen. I don't know. Probably not. \nCUT TO: \nEXT CAMP VICTORY   WEAPONS DISCHARGE STATION   AFTERNOON \nJames, Sanborn and Eldridge are discharging their weapons, dry firing them into steel drums. Clicking of ammunition. Long shadows. \nEXT CAMP VICTORY   FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER    AFTERNOON \nJames steps out, grabs a smoke, as a soccer ball rolls beside him. It's Pele's. Inviting James to play. \nPELE (SHOUTING) Ball! Ball! \nJames picks it up, and carries it over to a pile of sandbags and sits down. Pele runs up. \nPELE Give it. \nJAMES Give me my five bucks and I'll give you your ball. \nPELE Five dollars - for what? \nJAMES Those DVDs were crap. They were so fuzzy I couldn't see a thing. \nPELE No, impossible. \nJAMES I'm telling you, they were fuzzy. \nPELE That's Hollywood, my man. Special effects. \nThe boy's chutzpa amuses James. He's starting to like this kid. \nJAMES What's your name anyway? \nPELE Pele. \nJAMES Oh yeah - like the soccer player? \nPELE Yes, the great Pele \nJames gets up. Motions for the kid to give him space. \nJAMES Ready? One, two -- \nHe smashes the ball in Pele's direction -- it flies up. Pele blocks it easily, kicking high in the air. \nJAMES -- three. Shit. \nPele comes back over to James, who has sat back down.   He notices the bomb patch on James' uniform. \nPELE (pointing to the patch) So you are EOD -- boomala boomala. It's fun, no? \nJAMES I like to disarm them. Tell   you what, kid, I'll buy another   DVD from you but if this one is   fuzzy you better watch out. Cause   I'm coming for you. \nINT   CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT    DAY \nSanborn and Eldridge eat together. In the corner of the room, James is eating alone in a sea of soldiers. \nINT CAMP VICTORY   HEAD SHED \nEldridge and the psychiatrist are back in session. \nELDRIDGE (LEANING FORWARD) What if I should be pulling the trigger more often? Killing people? Bomb makers. \nLT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE That's not your mission. Your mission is to protect life. Render safe. \nELDRIDGE But what if I need to change the mission - to survive? That bicyclist I told you about? I'm ninety percent sure he was an insurgent. I could have shot him. Not my mission. But it would have been legal. \nLT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE You don't have to turn into an animal just to protect yourself. \nELDRIDGE You don't? \nLT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE No. \nELDRIDGE And you know this from your extensive work in the field. \nLT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE I've done my field duty. \nELDRIDGE Where was that? Yale? \nLT. COL CAMBRIDGE Look, Specialist, if you want to stop talking to me, you can. These sessions are voluntary. You chose to be here, talking to me, just like you chose the Army, just like you chose EOD. You're in an elite volunteer unit. Not many guys have the IQ or the nerves to do it. Be proud of it. \nEldridge considers this.    The psychiatrist taps his pencil. Waiting. \nELDRIDGE Keep the soldier in the fight and the fight in the soldier, right Doc? \nEldridge puts out his hand, and they shake. \nELDRIDGE Seriously, I appreciate what you're saying. But you need to get out from behind this desk more. \nINT CAMP VICTORY   LAUNDRY ROOM   NIGHT \nJames is watching his clothes dry as they tumble around the machine. \nSanborn comes in with a pile of laundry. Sees James. \nSANBORN Hey. \nJAMES Hey. \n", "test2_true": "JAMES (QUIETLY) If you ever get in my shoes and put on the bomb suit you'll see your whole mind changes when you're in front of a bomb. You lose 20 IQ points just from the weight of the suit. Your brain gets so much adrenaline that you hallucinate. Turn off the walkie? \nSanborn stares straight ahead. \nJAMES You'll be lucky if all you do is turn off the walkie. \nOff the spinning dryer, we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT BAGHDAD   SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY   MID AFTERNOON \nHeat playing tricks with light on the ribbon of road - imaginary water pooling on the surface. \nAgain, the auditory landscape of Baghdad: distant CALL to prayer and the incessant RAT-TAT-TAT of gunfire. \nTITLE OVER: \nDAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 23 \nJames is walking uprange with a large artillery shell. It looks very heavy and he's sweating profusely. \nHe brings the bomb to the Humvee where Sanborn and Eldridge are waiting. They're also suffering in the heat. They take the shell from him, and stow it in the truck. \nJAMES How are we on water? I'm dying. \nELDRIDGE J.T.'s got some. \nJAMES (TO SANBORN) Water? \nSANBORN No. I'm all out. \nJames just looks at him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT   BAGHDAD   PURGATORY   DAY \nWe're at the south end of an EXPLOSIVES DISPOSAL RANGE, nicknamed, `Purgatory' -- an empty expanse of dirt pockmarked with craters and bordered on one side by a small number of dwellings. \nBOOM!!! A huge bomb explodes, sending dust and debris into the air in a mini mushroom cloud...We move across the field with the cloud, and settle where our EOD team is positioned by their Humvee. \nSanborn has a remote detonator in his hand and is about to blow it. \nSANBORN Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole \nJames interrupts -- \nJAMES Hold on a second. I think I forgot my gloves back there. \nJames jumps into the Humvee and drives down range, reversing the course we just took. It's a long way to the explosives, at least half a mile, and Sanborn and Eldridge watch him recede in the distance. \nJames is a tiny figure, ambling around the explosives pile. There's nobody else around. \nSanborn looks down at the detonator in his hand. Eldridge notices the look. \nELDRIDGE Those detonators break all the time. Accidental misfire. \nSANBORN With that shot laid out like that, it could be a UXO that just cooks off. \nELDRIDGE Boom. \nSANBORN Boom. \nELDRIDGE A shot that size would obliterate everything in its path. \nSANBORN His helmet, you'd have that. \nELDRIDGE Oh yeah, there'd be half a helmet somewhere. \nSANBORN And little bits of hair stuck to it. \nELDRIDGE Little bits of hair. \nSANBORN We'd have to recommend a major change in techniques and protocols so that kind of accident never happens again. You'd write the first draft of the report. \nELDRIDGE Are you serious? \nSANBORN I'm not going to write it. \nELDRIDGE No, are you serious about killing him? \n-- Sanborn looks up at Eldridge. Smiles. \nJames starts driving back uprange. \nCUT TO: \nEXT   FIELD OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD   LATE AFTERNOON \nAnother dusty nowhere. The EOD team is stopped in the middle of a road that cuts through a swath of desert. \nAt the roadside are several SOLDIERS and their vehicles. The soldiers look sunburned, tired. \nSanborn and Eldridge are near the soldiers, looking down the road where -- \nTITLE OVER: \n", "test2_id": 895, "test3_input": "Two soldiers run past them, carrying a stretcher. \nSANBORN Hey. \nThey stop to see what he's looking at. Twisted metal. \nSANBORN That's an engine block. A big one, too. From a truck probably. \nJAMES Oil tanker? \nSANBORN It's what I'm thinking. \nThe men keep walking, and now the SOUNDS from the Inferno are louder. \nAnother man rushes towards them, his face shrouded in blackness. \nSanborn points his rifle at the man's head. Hits him with the Hi-Beam of his light. The man is wearing a black wool ski mask. \nSANBORN Stop! Wagef! Wagef! \nSKI MASKED MAN No. I am working here. \nSanborn looks at him. Doesn't reply. \nJames puts his gun up on the guy. Now Eldridge does too. This guy is about to be toast. \nWhen... \nA face appears next to him. \nFACE He's with me. \nGuns cover the face... \nThen they see that above the face is a helmet... \nAnd on the top of the helmet is a COLONEL'S INSIGNIA. \nCOLONEL REED Okay fellas? \nJAMES Sorry, Sir. I didn't recognize you. \nGuns are lowered, fast. \nNow that the Colonel is fully visible in the light we can see that he's shaken by the scene of destruction around him. \nCOLONEL REED We haven't found a body so it could be a suicide bomber or some clever bastard that caused all this -- and slipped away to sip tea with his mommie -- we just don't know. \nAs the Colonel struggles to define the horror he's just seen, James jumps in to save him: \nJAMES We'll take a close look, Sir. \nCOLONEL REED This kind of situation we may never know what happened. This is a mass casualty situation - terrible destruction. \nJAMES Roger that, Sir. We'll do our best. \nA stretcher comes by. \nCOLONEL REED They're cowards, you know. I wish they would stand up and fight us, man to man, instead of playing hide and seek with me. \nJAMES Roger, Sir. We better get moving. \nCOLONEL REED Right, go ahead Sergeant. \nThe Colonel nods and moves off. His translator stands for a moment. Takes off his ski mask to reveal an intelligent face with deep set eyes and a dirty smear of five o'clock shadow. \nSKI MASKED MAN I'm Ahmed. My name is Ahmed. Thank you for not shooting me. \nThe men move on... \nAdvancing toward the plume of smoke and embers rising into the sky...smell of burning rubber and charred metal... \n...until they see it -- \n--the twisted steel carcasses of two small vehicles and a TANKER. \nThe image is biblical - the wounded and dead piled together in one Hieronymus Bosch maze of tangled limbs, body parts... \nPalm trees burning at the top...like Olympic torches. \nSOLDIERS secure the area.   GRIEVING FAMILIES swarm around the dead and dying -- \nJames, Sanborn and Eldridge approach. Wind fans nearby flames into a fountain of embers that float up into the black desert night. \nJames moves through charred metal, stumbling over something sharp. \n-- then something hits his leg... What? Flashlight, gun -- DOWN! -- it's a CHICKEN, charred -- feathers burned off but still walking around - disoriented, dying... \nJames stumbles sideways to avoid the charred hens... \nSOUNDS distant and near of wailing, MEDICS racing onto the SCENE -- \nA WOMAN wearing Bhurka appears out of the distant flames and haze -- looking disoriented, in apparent state of shock -- \nSANBORN \nA BODY lies trapped beneath a pile of rubble. Sanborn reaches down to remove one of the chunks of stone. It slides away, but another falls in its place. \nELDRIDGE \n", "test3_true": "SANBORN It's hair. \nJAMES \nApproaches the woman in the Bhurka -- \nJAMES Hey! Hey -- you alright? -- Keef Halek? \nShe turns to face him...madness in her eyes. \nJames' flashlight illuminates a massive crater, black...and empty. \nEldridge swirls around. \nELDRIDGE (CALLING) James?! \nJAMES Hey, I'm right here. \nJames is shining his light into a orange tree. There's a PERFECTLY formed ORANGE, unharmed, nestled among the burnt leaves. \nJAMES This is where the blast stopped. (beat) Look over there. \nJames is pointing to a building in the distance. It's past a row of houses and a field. \nSanborn comes into view. James nods to him and points again. \nJAMES Perfect vantage point for a remote det -- and I bet he's out there right now watching us make fools of ourselves. We could get him. \nELDRIDGE You want to go out there? \nJames keeps looking into the distance. \nJAMES Yeah, let's go hunting. \nELDRIDGE I could stand to get in some trouble. \nSanborn stares at James and the bandage on his head. \nSANBORN No. \nJAMES No? \nSANBORN Man, this is bullshit. You got -- what?-- three infantry platoons here. That's their job. \nJAMES (FIERCELY) You don't say No to me, Sergeant. I say No to you -- and I'm not going to let this bomber slink off while the grunts get their act together. (MORE) \nJAMES (CONT'D) (on the move) Let's go. Now. \nJames glowers at Sanborn and Eldridge and stomps off, down the alley toward an empty field. \nEldridge shoots Sanborn a sympathetic glance, and follows James. Sanborn watches them recede into the darkness. \nSanborn runs after them. \nFIELD \nThey move three abreast across a dark field, guns raised commando-style. Poised to strike. \nThey walk in silence, alert to every decibel. \nGravel underfoot. Enveloping night. \nThey come to a high wall, behind which the ground raises to a gentle hill that looks out onto the tanker. \nWALL \nSanborn gives James a leg up over the wall. James helps Sanborn over. \nThey lean over to pull Eldridge up but with the forty pounds of gear he's got on he's too heavy. \nJAMES You got to work on your pull ups. \nJames and Sanborn drop over the other side, and we follow them as they crouch low and approach a building construction site. \nWALL \nEldridge pushes his back against the wall and scans the area. It dawns on him that he's alone. \nCONSTRUCTION SITE \nSanborn and James come to the edge of the site and find what may or may not be the remains of the trigger man's camp. There's a florescent lantern still glowing and cigarette butts in a pile. \nJAMES That little bastard. Let's torch this spot so he can't use it again. \nJames pats his pockets down, looking for something. \nJAMES Do you have an incendiary? \nSANBORN No. \nThree quick SHOTS ring out -- they sound very close. \nSanborn and James instinctively fall to one knee. They scan the area -- nothing. \nAs one man, they rise and start running back to the wall. \nJAMES Eldridge!!! \n", "test3_id": 896}

And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast. \nFrom this angle close to the ground we FLY down a road strewn with war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit -- all of which, from this odd, jarring perspective, looks gigantic, monstrous. \nWe zoom towards a crumpled COKE CAN, the white `C' growing enormous on the screen, filling the screen like a skyscraper. \nWe SMASH into the can and barrel ahead. \nA RAG flutters, blocks the view, then tumbles away, as we -- \n-- zoom downhill, see nothing but gray sand, then zoom back up hill and off, catching air, a flash of the horizon line, BRIGHT SUN, and land hard on a packed road. \nWe close in on one particular pile of trash, which is topped with a white plastic garbage bag, and stop. Puffs of dust and fluttering plastic. \nWe glide across the fluttering plastic. Flies buzzing. Advancing slowly, inch by inch, to the edge for our first glimpse inside the bag: \nA RUSTY ARTILLERY SHELL. \nCUT TO: \nEXT MIDDLE EASTERN STREET/DAWN \nA military ROBOT (about 3 feet long and 2 feet high, aka `the bot') that rolls on tank-like treads and has a mechanical hand and an array of CAMERAS is moving around the bag. \nTITLE OVER: \nBAGHDAD, IRAQ - JANUARY, 2005 \nThis is all taking place on a dusty stretch of road in a quiet section of Baghdad, barren except for a few shops, some cement houses and a couple of parked cars. \nTHE U.S. MILITARY HAS CONTROL OF THE CITY, BUT INSURGENT GROUPS ARE MOUNTING FRESH ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS ON 31 JANUARY 2005. \nTHEY'VE ADOPTED A DEADLY NEW TACTIC, USING I.E.D.s - IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES - TO AMBUSH AMERICAN TROOPS. THE BODY COUNT IS RISING. \nIN RESPONSE, THE ARMY HAS DEPLOYED THE LAST OF ITS ELITE BOMB SQUAD UNITS, HOPING THAT THESE THREE MAN TEAMS CAN DISARM THE BOMBS BEFORE THEY EXPLODE, AND STEM THE TIDE OF DESTRUCTION. \nSOUND of far off GUNSHOTS and CALL to prayer. \nSEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY SOLDIERS are moving PEDESTRIANS away from the bag. Another group of SOLDIERS is clearing out all the shops: bakery, sandwich shop, and a butcher shop. \nNext to a parked Humvee, THREE EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal, aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS are crouched over a laptop computer, looking at the screen and the same image of the metal artillery shell inside the fluttering plastic. \nSERGEANT MATT THOMPSON wipes at the sweat on his forehead. This is summer in the desert and the median temperature on this bright clear morning is 110 degrees. \nTHOMPSON It's to the left. \nThompson   tears open a mushy Snicker's. He is fleshy around the arms   and middle, but there's real muscle underneath the flab and   truth be told, after so many years in EOD, he's lost the need   to have a show-off build. \nSANBORN Going left. \nSERGEANT J. T. SANBORN works the joystick on the laptop. He is a strapping Iowa farm boy, with a thick back from bailing hay. In contrast to his bulky frame, his face is soft, open, kind. He has a relaxed demeanor. Which might lead you to think nothing ever bothers Sanborn. But if you thought that, you'd be mistaken. Before joining EOD, Sanborn was in Military Intelligence. He quit. Military Intel was too easy. \nTHOMPSON Up a little. \nLAPTOP SCREEN \nRusty artillery shell now almost full frame. \nSANBORN \nSANBORN There? \nTHOMPSON Closer. I want to see the ojive. \nZoom on the nose cone of the shell. \nThe third soldier leans in for a better look. \nSPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE is a tall, lanky young man, the youngest of the group. He's a fighter like the others but also a reader, and something of a thinker. Eldridge crouches behind the other two soldiers, sipping a bottle of water, eyes never leaving the screen. \nTHOMPSON Push it in. \nSANBORN I can't get it inside. \nTHOMPSON Pretend it's your dick. \n", "test1_true": "Eldridge laughs.   He clearly likes the two men he's with. \nTHOMPSON Let me try. \nSANBORN Give me a second. \nTHOMPSON Give me a crack at it. \nSANBORN Shit. Okay. \nThey change places.   Thompson now on the controls. \nTHOMPSON Hello mamma. See that? \nSANBORN Looks like a one-five-five. \nEldridge gets up and goes to the Humvee, fishes around inside. \nTHOMPSON Yeah. That can do some damage. \nSANBORN We're going to need a charge. \nEldridge is already on it, approaching with the four blocks of C4. He's done this enough to know what they need. \nELDRIDGE Figured four blocks. Hey with these four blocks and the ninety pounds, are we going to be far enough away? \nNow we see the tiny toy robot in the far distance -- far, far away. \nBehind the Humvee and on either side of the road INFANTRY SOLDIERS are still clearing civilian onlookers from nearby stores. \nThompson stands and takes a good look at his surroundings. \nTHOMPSON The blast is going to roll out there (pointing) the shell will probably kick out there (pointing), and most of the shrapnel is going to rain up in an umbrella pattern. Some smaller pieces and shell fragments will come out this way -- but we'll be okay if we are behind the truck. \nThe idea that he would be standing in the open amuses Eldridge. \nELDRIDGE You know I'll be behind the truck. \nTHOMPSON Nothing wrong with that, Owen. Let's get the area cleared-- (looks around at the crowd OF ONLOOKERS) --as best we can, then load up the bot. \nEldridge double times it over to a nearby soldier. Together they herd away various bystanders. \nCUT TO: \nDOWNRANGE \nThe bot dutifully makes its return voyage to the plastic bag, this time towing a cart which is loaded with C4 and a blasting cap, and a coil of unspooling detonation wire. \nThe robot hits a bump causing the blasting cap to tumble to the ground, where it begins to roll -- \nUPRANGE \nEveryone cringes.   The cap doesn't explode. Close call. \nSANBORN Damn. \nDOWNRANGE \nThe blasting cap has rolled into a gully, out of reach of the robot hand. \nUPRANGE \nSanborn wiggles the stick.      It's not happening. \nSANBORN Matt, the bot's not going to do it. \nTHOMPSON Keep trying. \nDOWNRANGE \nThe robot hand tries again. No dice. \nUPRANGE \nTHOMPSON Okay, you're right. I have to go down there - don't you think? \nSanborn nods. \nTHOMPSON I don't want to wait around here in this neighborhood anyway. \nSANBORN (WRYLY) What, you don't like it here? \nTHOMPSON Let's just get me dressed. \nCUT TO: \nHUMVEE \nSanborn unpacks \"THE SUIT.\" A bizarre contraption that looks like an astronaut suit and helmet crossed with the Michelin Man. Because of its weight and complexity it takes two men to put it on - or one Sanborn. \nSanborn kneels down and guides Thompson's feet into the suit's black boots, then lashes up a series of Velcro straps to secure the armor, like a squire working on a knight. \nA strap near the crotch prompts Thompson to wisecrack: \nTHOMPSON Watch it. \nSANBORN (SMILING) I thought you already had your children, Sergeant. \n", "test1_id": 894, "test2_input": "JAMES (HEADSET) Hell, I don't know. I'll let you know when I'm standing over it. \nWe see the world from James' point of view now, the city of Baghdad has taken on an intense and dreamy hue, as if we're in some sort of fugue state: \n--He looks down the strange, threatening Iraqi street. \nHe walks on. The suit is heavy, little puffs of sand with each footfall. The sun beats down. \nJames nears an intersection guarded on either side by a Humvee and several SOLDIERS, when... \nINTERSECTION \nSuddenly a red-and-white TAXI swerves past the SOLDIERS on the left side of the intersection. The soldiers take cover and shout contradictory commands - Get Down Motherfucker! Don't Move! Back up! Out of the vehicle! \nThe TAXI BRAKES in front of James. \nUPRANGE \nSanborn and Eldridge can hear the shouting but the lingering smoke still obscures their sight. \nSANBORN (INTO WALKIE) JAMES -- \nELDRIDGE (shouting to Sanborn) Car! Car! A car stopped in front of him. \nJAMES \nJames' HEADSET WALKIE barks to life: \nSANBORN O.S. (HEADSET) Come back. \nJames pulls a pistol from his holster, and -- \nJAMES (HEADSET) I got it. \n-- shoots two rounds into the dirt, near the car's front tire. \nDRIVER'S FACE \nImpossible to read. Is he a taxi driver annoyed by the roadblock, or an insurgent fighter getting ready to blow a suicide bomb? \nONE OF THE ARMY SOLDIERS \nWith field glasses on the intersection he speaks into the walkie. \nSOLDIER (OVER WALKIE) EOD has a nine on this Haji in the car. I'm going to get two guys over there to back him up. \nSANBORN \nStill can't see clearly. Processing this information.   Turns to Eldridge. \nEldridge using his rifle scope as well - shakes his head.    No visual. \nSANBORN (into walkie to soldier) Negative, negative. You're too close to the IED-- (HESITATING) Stand down. EOD has the situation under control. \nSweat on his forehead. \nJAMES \nNow aiming at the windshield. But the driver is impassive. \nUPRANGE \nEldridge looks through his rifle scope. \nELDRIDGE (shouting to Sanborn) We're in a kill zone! \nINTERSECTION \nJames fires, shattering the windshield. But the car doesn't budge. \nJames is pissed. He lunges through the windshield and jams his gun into the driver's forehead. \nSOLDIER \nSOLDIER (INTO WALKIE) Three or four rounds fired. The nine is now pressing into the Haji's forehead. \nINTERSECTION \nThe gun digs into the driver's forehead. Beat. The driver shifts into reverse. \nHe rolls back to the soldiers, who then rush the car, yank the driver out, and deliver a savage beating as James looks on. \nJAMES \nJAMES (chuckling into his HEADSET) If he wasn't an insurgent he sure as hell is now. \nAnd he resumes his walk towards the white garbage bag and the rubble pile, noting possible threats -- a MAN in a window down the road. \nUPRANGE \nSANBORN (coolly, into walkie) Copy that. (MORE) \nSANBORN (CONT'D) But I have no idea what you're talking about, Blaster One, since I can't see you. Over. \nJAMES O.S. (HEADSET) I'll tell you later. James out. \nPILE OF RUBBLE \nOne of a million in this city. James draws near. Two wires protrude from the mess. \n", "test2_true": "The wires are exposed. He cuts one. Then flips the artillery rounds over and cuts the other wire. \nJAMES (HEADSET) We're done. \nHe stands and uses his big boot to clear more rubble. A banana peel is pushed away, revealing: \nAnother wire snaking out of the ground. \nJAMES (HEADSET) Secondary! \nJames spins to look uprange. Sees Sanborn motioning for the men to get down. \nUPRANGE \nSANBORN (TO ELDRIDGE) Off the wall, Owen! (TO SOLDIERS) Get behind something. Find cover. \nSoldiers scrambling to find concrete to hide behind. \nJAMES \nJames YANKS the wire out of the dirt but it turns out to be buried like a root, and the more he rips the more the wire is revealed. He rips and rips, going back ten feet. \n---The wire is stuck in the ground, and it will not come out anymore. James digs with a knife -- FURIOUSLY moving earth -- until he reaches a third artillery shell, which he pulls out of the ground. \n--CU knife blade inside the shell -- \n--CU James' helmet - glass clouding over from condensation -- losing visibility. \n--ECU blasting cap -- \n--ECU knife tip separates the wire... \nCUT TO: \nUPRANGE   MOMENTS LATER \nJames strides uprange. Eldridge isn't sure what to make of James. Sanborn is, but not ready to show it. \nJAMES (gulping air as the helmet IS REMOVED) Did you see that guy? (smiles, recovers his MACHO) Man, I need a beer. \nSanborn begins the bomb suit removal ritual - unstrapping Velcro. \nSANBORN We can arrange that. \nHe yanks at the strap - a little roughly. \nSANBORN What do you like? \nJAMES Colt. \nSANBORN Nice southern brand. \nYanks at another strap. \nJames looks down, the tone of Sanborn's voice and the force of the strap gets his attention. \nEldridge picks up the pieces of the suit and places them into the Humvee. Listening to this exchange. \nELDRIDGE I'd take a beer. \nJAMES (SMILING) Hey, that wasn't too bad, for our first time working together. \nSANBORN I think working together is I talk to you. And you talk to me. \nJAMES Are we going on a date, J.T.? \nSanborn stands, removing the last piece of the suit. \nSANBORN No, we're going on a mission. And it's my job to keep you safe, so we can keep going on missions. \nJAMES Hey, this is combat. \nWith that James walks to the Humvee and gets inside. \nSanborn closes the trunk, hard, startling Eldridge.    Eldridge comes close, speaking out of James' earshot. \nELDRIDGE It's just thirty nine days. \nSANBORN Thirty eight. Assuming we survive today. \nELDRIDGE Tick-tock. Tick-tock. \nINT HUMVEE \nJames is in the passenger seat, waiting impatiently. Sanborn and Eldridge get in. \nJAMES I don't mean to mix it up. But the situation dictated it. \nSANBORN (COOLLY) Roger that. \nJAMES I'm serious. We're gonna work together. You'll get used to my ops tempo. \nSANBORN Your ops tempo? \nJAMES I don't always stop to chat, and I like to go fast. You know, so the insurgents don't have time to plan. I don't want them make any cell phone calls. \nOff Sanborn's face. \n", "test2_id": 895, "test3_input": "SOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Roger. I'll see if we can push this ahead. \nJames squats down, rests his rifle, looks at the floor. \nMoments pass and he feels a set of eyes on him. \nHe swivels his head to the left and makes eye contact with the dead kid on the table. The face doesn't have any of the markers of death; it looks alive. \nJames turns away, then is compelled to make eye contact again. He looks at his watch. The seconds tick by all too slowly. He grabs his walkie-talkie. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Fifteen is not going to work. I need to do this now. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Roger, I understand. If it was me, I would go for it, but I don't think command is going to budge under the circumstances. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Tell command I'm in a fucking war zone. And I'm going to blow now. \nJames gets up, clips his rifle, and takes the last few steps out of the room. \nSOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Blaster One, I don't know who you know, but you got your permission. Ready to det any time you say so. \nAt the door he stops to look at the dead boy on the table. He looks and looks. Finally: \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) Cancel that det. \nCUT TO: \nJAMES \nReaching over the body of the boy. He pulls the artillery shell out of the boy's abdomen with his bare hands. He wipes his hands on his pants. \nJAMES (INTO WALKIE) This is Blaster One, I'm coming down. \nINT   BOMBED OUT BUILDING \nJames carries the body down the staircase. The head and feet bump the sides of the staircase as he descends. \nEXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING     MOMENTS LATER \nThe BODY lies on the street, James standing over it. A blue and white pickup TRUCK emblazoned with the logo of the Iraqi National Police pulls up to their position. \nA pair of POLICEMEN get out and after a few words with James, they load the body. \nHUMVEE \nSanborn and Eldridge sit across from each other, watching James. \nELDRIDGE ...So you really don't think it was the DVD kid? \nSANBORN No, I don't. \nELDRIDGE You're positive? \nSANBORN Yeah. Could it be? One in a million chance. \nELDRIDGE I don't know. Will seemed positive. But that was weird. \nSANBORN Very weird. \nThey look out the window and notice Lt. Colonel Cambridge down the street surrounded by a crowd of IRAQI MEN. \nCAMBRIDGE \nCambridge is trying to talk to several of them at once. \nCAMBRIDGE This is not a safe area for you. Imshee! \nThey don't leave. Cambridge lifts his rifle, not quite shouldering it. Then one MAN, mid thirties, in a suit, steps forward. \nIRAQI MAN (FLAWLESS ENGLISH) Why do you talk to us like children. We are not children. \nCAMBRIDGE Gimme a break, will you? \nIRAQI MAN Why should I? \nCambridge, suddenly not so sure of himself, looks back to the Humvee and sees -- \nJAMES \nWatching the police truck drive away. He then moves for the Humvee, motioning for Cambridge to load up. \nINT   HUMVEE \nEldridge guzzles some water.    Wipes sweat from his brow. \nELDRIDGE But then Will's pretty weird. He keeps bomb parts under his bed. \nPassing the water to Sanborn. \nSANBORN I bet you he doesn't put this one under his bed. \nSanborn laughs. \nJames cracks the door, jumps inside. \nHe sees Cambridge walk past the brick pile that the OLD IRAQI MAN had created. The man is no longer there. Something crosses his mind when-- \n--The brick pile explodes in a A SICKENING BLAST, obliterating Cambridge and flipping the Humvee \n--James, Sanborn and Eldridge SPIN upside down as the Humvee is buffeted by the blast - landing upside down. \n", "test3_true": "--Billowing smoke, dirt and debris smears the windshield blotting out the sun. \n--Inside, a flurry of HANDS yank on the heavy armored Humvee door. It doesn't budge. \nEXT   HUMVEE \nA SOLDIER runs to the rescue. He reaches for the Humvee door, the metal sears his hand, and he pulls back in pain. \nThe soldier uses his rifle butt to jam the door open - but that doesn't work, because the butt doesn't catch the handle. From inside, the POUNDING and YELLS grow louder. \nThe soldier drops the rifle and grabs the searing metal with his hand, burning his flesh as he pries the handle. \nThe Humvee door finally gives. Three men tumble out onto blackened sand. \nCUT TO: \nINT   BOMBED OUT BUILDING    LATER \nJames is standing in the doorway into the building, dividing his attention between the outside and the interior -- where Sanborn and Eldridge are slumped against a wall. \nSanborn stares at a blank wall. Eldridge is running his hand over a cigarette lighter -- seeing how much of the flame he can bear. He looks as if he's hoping the physical pain will help put the psychic pain in perspective. \nJames, standing in the light of the doorway, is smoldering with rage and ungovernable purpose. He's smoking. \nWe stay here for a moment to watch as each man makes his own deal with himself. \nThrough the open doorway a Humvee comes into view. \nJames stomps out his cigarette. \nJAMES Our ride is here. \nBeat. \nSanborn and Eldridge remain in a trance. \nJAMES We're movin'. \nHe walks out into the glare. Sanborn and Eldridge rise to follow him. \nEXT   CAMP VICTORY   DUSK \nFunnel of wind erases a tank tread in the sand. \nMore sand drifts and piles like snow up against a small mountain of sand bags. \nSand disappears the windshield of a parked Abrams as day moves into night. \nEXT   CAMP VICTORY   MESS TENT   MORNING \nDust. Wind. \nJames is stalking towards an OLDER IRAQI MAN who is selling DVDs at Pele's usual table. \nJAMES Hey - you haven't seen that kid around here by any chance - who sells movies? \nThe man shakes his head. \nDVD MAN Sorry. No English. \nJAMES No English? Don't lie to me. Where's that kid? \nDVD MAN Sorry, my man. Movie? Five dollars. \nJames shakes his head and walks away, heading towards a clump of SOLDIERS standing in the shade of a tree. \nJAMES Are you guys responsible for this area? \nGUARD What's up? \nJAMES That motherfucker over there (pointing to the Man) could be an insurgent, watching the camp and giving intel to his buddies so they know where to launch their mortars. \nGUARD I think he's just a guy selling DVDs. \nJAMES He's a security risk. You should get rid of him. \nGUARD The merchants are cleared. I couldn't do anything to him without the say-so from my CO. \nJames realizes that he has no hope of prevailing. Agitated, he turns away, and we stay with him as he trudges down one of Victory's dusty roads. \nEXT. CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT DUSK \nIt's the end of the day and the DVD seller packs up his wares to go. \nJames, in sunglasses, sweatshirt covering his army fatigues, follows him to his car. James draws near, and points his pistol at the guy's crotch. \nJAMES Does this change anything? \nThe DVD man looks stunned. \nINT   DVD MAN'S CAR   CAMP VICTORY GATE   DUSK \nJames leans across the DVD man and flashes his ID to one of two GUARDs. \nJAMES OGA. \nThe guard looks to his buddy who mouths \"CIA\" \n", "test3_id": 896}

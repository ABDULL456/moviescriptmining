NEYTIRI We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer -- 
JAKE I don't want Ninat. 
NEYTIRI There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter -- 
Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her. 
JAKE I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. 
She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving gently over each other. 
NEYTIRI She already has. 
He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other. 
Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling. 
NEYTIRI Kissing is very good. But we have something better. 
She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss. 
Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined. 
MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle undulations. 
JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. The ultimate intimacy. 
They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them. 
THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO -- 
LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.     Spent.   He strokes her face tenderly. 
JAKE Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping. 
She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest -- 
NEYTIRI This body is real. (she touches his forehead) This spirit is real. 
Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep. 
NEYTIRI When I was first your teacher, I hated all Sky People. But you have also taught me. (WHISPERING) Spirit is all that matters. 
She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. 
NEYTIRI I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for life. 
JAKE We are? 
NEYTIRI Yes. It is our way. (INNOCENTLY) Oh. I forgot to tell? 
He rouses up, making her look at him. 
JAKE Really, we are? 
NEYTIRI We are. 
Jake considers this. 
JAKE It's cool. I'm there. 
He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps. 
INT. SHACK - NIGHT 
Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there, thinking. In his coffin. In another world. CUT TO: 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN 
DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield Parrish painting. But then -- 
THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous treads gets louder. 
SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows. She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up. 
NEYTIRI Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come back to me now. Jake! 
INT. SHACK - DAWN 
HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE, still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs. 
GRACE Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to force-feed a cripple. 
She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the plate under his nose. 
GRACE (GRINNING) She's not going anywhere. 
He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs. 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN 
Neytiri SCREAMS as -- 
The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at him, frantically trying to wake him, as -- 
INT. SHACK - DAWN 
Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the empty plate. 
GRACE And when was the last time you took a shower? Jesus, Marine. 
Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down. 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE 
AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see -- 
NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.   He leaps up as -- 
THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the trees, plowing the earth before it. 
JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms. 
JAKE Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!

MANDELLA (unconvinced) Oh, good.  Something new and different for us. 
EXT. ARCHERY FIELD - DAY 
Mr. Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets 
Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim. Chastity watches from across the row. 
JOEY Hey, sweet cheeks. 
BIANCA (not looking at him) Hi, Joey. 
JOEY You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class. 
She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him. 
JOEY (continuing) Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom. 
BIANCA You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go -- 
In the background, a RASTA crumples to the ground.  Hit A casualty of Gym.  Mr. Chapin scurries over. 
JOEY Your sister is going. 
Bianca looks at him, surprised 
BIANCA Since when? 
Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand.  He draws back and takes aim. 
JOEY I'm taking care of it. 
Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps lips firmly shut. 
INT. BOOK STORE - DAY 
Kat browses through the feminist lit section Patrick appears, through a hole in the books. 
PATRICK Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy. 
KAT (frowning) What are you doing here? 
PATRICK I heard there was a poetry reading. 
KAT You 're so -- 
PATRICK Pleasant? 
Kat stares at him, deadpan. 
PATRICK (continuing) Wholesome. 
KAT Unwelcome. 
PATRICK Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. 
KAT Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties. 
PATRICK So what did I have an effect on ? 
KAT Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing. 
She pushes past him and heads out the' door Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand: Taming of the Shrew.

Cameron  and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into mouth. 
PATRICK You were right. She's still pissed. 
MICHAEL Sweet love, renew thy force! 
PATRICK Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you. 
CAMERON (exasperated) You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.

PATRICK If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
